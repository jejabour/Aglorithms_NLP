Abstract
Administration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is a routine procedure in orthopedic surgery. Besides systemic prophylaxis, only
few techniques are established for local application of antibiotics to reduce infection related to orthopedic implants.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of locally versus systemically applied gentamicin in a rat model ( n= 60). For local
application, the antibiotic was delivered from a biodegradable poly( d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) coating of titanium implants. The efficacy of local
prophylaxis was compared to a systemic single shot application of gentamicin as well as a combination of both administrations.
Half of the animals received a weight-adopted single shot application of gentamicin 30 min prior to surgery. At surgery, the medullary
cavities of the tibiae were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (102colony forming units /CFU) and titanium Kirschner wires were
implanted into the medullary canals. The implants were either uncoated, PDLLA coated, or coated with PDLLA + 10% w/w gentamicin.
The animals were followed up for 42 days. X-ray examinations were performed; body weight, temperature, and the clinical condition were
determined.
After sacrifice, infection was evaluated by histological and microbiological analysis.
All animals treated with uncoated or PDLLA-coated Kirschner wires without systemic application of the antibiotic developed
osteomyelitis and all cultures of implants were tested positive on S. aureus.
Implant-related osteomyelitis could be prevented by prophylaxis of systemically applied gentamicin in 15% of animals. In contrast, local
application of gentamicin delivered from a PDLLA coating was more effective. Onset of infection could be prevented in 90% of animalstreated with gentamicin coated Kirschner wires, and in 80% of the animals that were treated with a combination of local and systemicapplication. The local application from PDLLA-coated implants might support systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing implant-
associated osteomyelitis.

Introduction
Incorporated biomaterials, including metallic implants,
are known to promote onset of infection. In orthopedics,
implant-related osteomyelitis is a feared complication and theconsequences can be devastating, leading to prolonged
hospitalization, poor functional outcome, and sepsis [50].
The incidence of infection following elective orthopedic
surgery is low and ranges from 0.7 to 4.2% [2,3,31,32,44] ,
depending on type of operation, soft tissue status, generalpatient condition, and prophylactic administration of anti-biotics [9,15,23] . Patients with open fractures are known to
be at higher risk of infection (5–33%) [27,30,35,41] .

Bone infections associated with foreign body materials are
especially difficult to treat. Removal of the infected device[4,37,46,48] , long-term systemic antibiotic therapy with all
its side effects [42,45,47,49] , and multiple revisions with
radical debridement are frequently required.
Systemic perioperative application of antibiotics is
routinely performed and the efficacy has clearly beenproven [5,6,9,31,32] . A single dose of systemic antibiotic
is usually administered to counteract bacterial contami-
nation and possible surgical infection.
Besides systemic prophylaxis, various techniques of local
antibiotic delivery are in clinical use to reduce the rate ofinfection (antibiotic loaded bone cements, antibiotic impreg-nated collagen sponges, and polymethylmethacrylate beads)[7,14,22,29] . A limiting factor of an effective local antibiotic
prophylaxis is the way to deliver the antibiotic to the interface
of tissue and implant. Due to disturbed tissue function caused
by surgical trauma, bacteria seeded during surgery may causeimplant-related infection [12,13,43] . Attachment mainly of S.
epidermidis , but also of certain strains of Staphylococcus
aureus , to foreign body surfaces induces the synthesis of a
bacterial extracellular polysaccharide matrix (glycocalix)[13,14] . In consequence, biofilm formation may develop
which makes eradication of the infection difficult, unless the
infected implant is removed [18].
As reported earlier, a 10- Am thin biodegradable,
poly( d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) coating of titanium implants
can serve as a local drug delivery system for incorporatedgentamicin (10% w/w) [24]. The antibiotic is liberated
with an initial burst from the coating. Thus, high levelsof the antibiotic can be achieved at the interface of implantand bone for a limited time [26].
The objective of our present study was to compare the
efficacy of this local application technique of gentamicin toa systemic, weight-adopted, stand-alone, single-shot appli-cation of the antibiotic and to a combination of bothadministrations.
A new model of acute implant-related osteomyelitis in rat
tibiae was used [25]. Development of infection was assessed
by X-ray examination, clinical, microbiological, and histo-
logical investigations.
Materials and methods
Implant-related infection in rats was induced according to
a previously reported protocol [25]. The pathogen applied
wasS. aureus , subspecies aureus Rosenbach, obtained from
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, U.S.A.
(ATCC 49230). This strain is sensitive to flucloxacillin,gentamicin, and erythromicin, but resistant to penicillin.
Preparation of bacterial inoculum
From an overnight culture of S. aureus in 9-ml tryptic
soy broth (TSB) (caseinpepton–soybean flour–peptonsolution; Oxoid LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England),
portions of 100 Al were transferred into sterile tubes
containing 3 ml of TSB. These tubes were incubated for3ha t3 7 8C in order to obtain log-phase growth. After
incubation tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000rpm, the supernatant was decanted and the remainingpellet was washed twice with phosphate buffered saline(PBS). Under spectrophotometric control (Densimat; Bio-
Me´rieux SA, Marcy-L’Etoile, France), the bacterial sedi-
ment was added to PBS until Mc Farland standard ofsix was obtained. Colony forming units (CFU) permilliliter were confirmed by several plate counts, usinga spiral platter (Spiral System Inc., Cincinnati, USA).Suspensions were divided into portions of 1.5 ml andfrozen at /C0808C. Possible fluctuations of concentrations
(CFU/ml) were registered by confirming the CFU/ml at
surgery.
PDLLA coating of titanium Kirschner wires
Poly( d,l-lactide) (Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany)
with a molecular weight of 30,000 Da was dissolved in1.5 ml volatile solvent–ethyl acetate–at room temperature.The solution was sterile filtered (Minisart, 0.2 Am, Sartorius,
Germany).
Lyophilized gentamicin sulfate (Synopharm, Barsb qttel,
Germany) was suspended in the solution by magneticvortex, yielding a concentration of 10% gentamicin basew/w of the polymer. For further details, see Schmidmaier[40].
Titanium Kirschner wires, 0.8 mm in diameter (Stratec
Medical, Oberdorf, Switzerland), were dipped into the
solution and dried under sterile laminar airflow conditions.
The coating process was repeated once after drying.
Animals and operative procedure
All experiments were approved by the Animal Exper-
imentation Ethics Committee of Berlin (Reg.-No. G0296/99).
60 female, 5-month-old Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan-
Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany) were operated for study
purpose.
Surgery was performed under general anesthesia by
weight-adopted intraperitoneal injection of Xylazin 2%(Medistar R; 12 mg/kg body weight) and Ketamaninhydro-
chlorid (Ketavet; 100 mg/ml; 80 mg/kg body weight).
Animals were prepared for surgery as follows:The left hind leg was shaved, depilated, and disinfected
with alcohol. The animals were placed on sterile drapes, the
bodies were covered with sterile sheets, and the left hind legwas draped separately with sterile incision foil (Barrier-Flexk, Johnson & Johnson Medical Limited, Gargrave,
U.K.). Skin and fascia at the proximal tibial metaphysiswere incised over 5 mm in length. With a hand-driven burr,a 1-mm hole was drilled through cortical and cancellousbone to access the medullary cavity at the proximalM. Lucke et al. / Bone 36 (2005) 770–778 771
metaphysis. The medullary cavity was bluntly reamed with
a steel Kirschner wire (1.0 mm diameter) followed byreaming with a 0.8-mm Kirschner wire in order to reach thenarrowing distal part of the tibial cavity. After removal, 10Al of bacterial suspension containing 10
2CFU/10 Alo fS.
aureus (ATCC 49230) was injected with a 50- Al micro
syringe (Hamilton R, IL, USA) for contamination of the
medullary cavity [25]. According to study groups, uncoated
titanium Kirschner wires (Stratec Medical, Oberdorf,
Switzerland), titanium Kirschner wires coated with PDLLA,or Kirschner wires coated with PDLLA containing 10%gentamicin were inserted. The excess parts of the Kirschnerwires were cut off at the site of entry. Soft tissue wasirrigated, and skin and fascia were sutured in single knottechnique (Resolon R5/0 Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany).
Study groups
Half of the animals ( n= 30) received a systemic,
weight-adopted dose of gentamicin 30 min prior tosurgery (intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg body weight,Synopharm GmbH, Barsb qttel, Germany). Blood samples
were drawn for determination of serum levels ofgentamicin 30 min after application.
The other 30 animals received an intraperitoneal injec-
tion of saline instead.
The following groups were investigated ( n= 10 animals
each group):
Follow-up
Animals were followed up for 42 days and were then
sacrificed. All procedures were carried out under inhalationanesthesia with isoflurane (Forene R).
On the day of surgery and regularly throughout the
observation period, body weight and body temperaturewere measured. The clinical condition of the animals waschecked and X-rays of the left tibia in two planes wereperformed.
Radiographic evaluation
Radiographs in anteroposterior and lateral view were
taken on days 0 (OP), 14, 28, and 42 with a distance fromfocus to film of 80 cm. For X-rays, digital films (DLRCassette, Digiscan 2H/2C, Siemens) and a Mobilett Plus X-ray unit (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) were used. To
assess development and progression of bone infection, thefollowing three regions of interest (ROI) were determined
and separately evaluated ( Fig. 1 ): (1) proximal epi-/
metaphysis, (2) diaphysis, (3) distal epi-/metaphysis. Fourindependent observers evaluated each radiograph in ablinded manner. The following radiographic appearanceswere assessed according to a modified score of An andFriedman [1]: (1) Periosteal reaction, (2) Osteolysis, (3) Soft
tissue swelling, (4) Deformity, (5) General impression, (6)
Spontaneous fracture, (7) Sequestrum formation.
Parameters 1–5 ranged from 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2
(moderate) to 3 (severe) and have been evaluated for everyROI. Parameters 6 and 7 were judged with 0 (absent) or 1(present). For assessment of parameters 6 and 7, radio-graphs were not subdivided into ROI. The maximum scoreto be achieved was 47 [24].
Blood analyses
Blood samples (0.5 ml) were taken from the ophthalmic
vein plexus [36] 30 min after systemic application of
gentamicin and saline, respectively, for determination ofthe gentamicin serum levels. Gentamicin was quantifiedusing a Fluorescence Polarization ImmunoAssay Kit fromRoche Diagnostics (Cobas Integra 400/Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
Body weight and body temperature
On days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42, rectal body
temperature was measured using a digital thermometer, andbody weight was determined with a precision scale. Animalswere inspected for clinical signs of infection (appearance of
wound and soft tissue at entry site of implant, joint effusion,
loss of mobility, general condition).
Sacrifice
Under general anesthesia, the chest situs was opened.
Three milliliters of blood was drawn from the right atriumfor culture and a lethal dose of potassium chloride was
applied by intracardial injection.
The tibiae of the left hind legs were dissected under
sterile conditions using separate instruments for prepara-tion of the skin and the tissue underneath. The entire softtissue was removed and bones were weighed with aprecision scale.
Microbiological evaluation
The Kirschner wires were explanted, rolled over nutrient
agar (Columbia Rfull blood, Becton Dickinson Microbiology
Europe, Meylan Cedex, France), and placed in 2.5 ml sterileTSB. Agar plates and TSB were incubated at 37 8C. After 24
h, CFU on agar plates were counted and bacterial growth inthe tryptic soy broth was judged (cloudy: positive growth;clear: no growth).

Bacteria isolated from blood cultures and agar plates
were identified using a fully automized laboratory systemfor identification and resistance determination of bacteria(VitekR, Bio-Me ´rieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France).
Randomly, five tibiae of every group were chilled with
liquid nitrogen, crushed into fragments and pulverized in asterile bone mill (Retsch R, Haan, Germany). 150 mg of bone
powder were agitated in 1.5 ml of sterile PBS for 2 min by
vortex. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 s (10,000
rpm), and 100 Al of the supernatant was withdrawn. The
samples were analyzed for CFU/ml using a spiral platter(Spiral System Inc., Cincinnati, USA) for determination ofCFU S. aureus /g bone.
Bone histology
The remaining five tibiae of each group were fixed in
formaldehyde for 1 day, dehydrated in inclining alcoholsolution and embedded in methylmethacrylate (Technovit R
9100, Heraeus, Wehrheim, Germany). Longitudinal sectionsin a sagittal plane were cut at 5 Am by Leica SM 2500S
microtome (Bensheim, Germany) with a 40 8stainless steel
knife. Slices were stained with Masson–Goldner stain. Fourregions of interest (ROI) were determined:
1. proximal epi-/metaphysis,
2. proximal diaphysis,3. distal diaphysis,4. distal epi-/metaphysis.
Slices of the same bone plane were evaluated for
the following parameters in accordance to Petty et al. [34]:
1. abscess formation,
2. sequestrum formation,3. enlargement of corticalis,4. destruction of corticalis,
5. general impression.
Parameters 1 to 4 were scored with 0 (absent) or 1
(present). Parameter 5 was scored from 0 (absent), 1 (mild)to 2 (severe). All parameters have been assessed for eachROI. Four independent observers scored all slices separatelyin a blinded manner. The maximum score to be achieved
was 24.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the
Department of Statistics and Biometrics of the Charite ´—
University Medicine Berlin. Data were expressed as themeanFstandard deviation (SD). Statistical differences
were analyzed using Mann–Whitney UTest and balanced
with the Bonferroni–Holm Test if more than two groupswere compared. Pb0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Interobserver reliability of the histological andradiological score evaluation had been determined before[25] (Bland et Altman Plots).
The limits of agreement for the radiological scoring were
4.1F3.8 (range of score 0–47), and for histological
scoring, 0.7 F1.6 (range of score 0–24). SPSS software
10.0 was used for statistical analysis.

X-ray examinations
All animals treated without systemic application of
gentamicin that had received uncoated or PDLLA-coatedwires (groups I and II) developed clear radiographic signs ofosteomyelitis. These findings (osteolysis) became detectableafter 2 weeks. Until 6 weeks post-operation, an increase ofosteolytic lesions, development of periosteal elevation, and
new bone formation were observed yielding in consecutive
deformity ( Fig. 1 ).
Animals with uncoated or PDLLA-coated wires (groups
IV and V) that were treated with a systemic application ofGentamicin revealed nearly the same radiographic appear-ances. Only in three out of these 20 animals no radiographicsigns of infection became evident.
Throughout the observation period, the radiographic
score assessment did not show any significant difference
between animals treated with uncoated and PDLLA-coatedwires (groups I, II, IV, V) ( Table 1 ).
In animals with gentamicin-coated implants (groups III
and VI), radiographic signs of infection were nearly absent.At sacrifice, X-rays of these two groups had been assessedwith significantly lower mean score values in comparison toall other groups ( Table 1 ). No statistical difference was
found between groups III (no systemic application) and VI
(with systemic application).
Gentamicin serum levels
Blood samples for determination of the serum gentamicin
levels were obtained 28.8 F3.2 min after application. The
mean serum level of gentamicin was 4.6 F2.8 mg/l. The
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the used strain of
S. aureus was determined to be 0.5 mg/l.
Microbiological evaluationEvaluation of inoculated bacteria at surgery
Analysis by spiral platter of the applied inocula of S.
aureus during surgery yielded an average of 86.4 F37.9
CFU/10 Al. The inocula ranged from 73 up to 132 CFU/
10Al.
Blood cultures
None of the blood cultures obtained at sacrifice were
tested positive on S. aureus in any group. From one blood
culture of group IV, Streptococcus viridans was isolated.Cultures of implants
After sacrifice, S. aureus could be cultured from all
implants of groups I and II (uncoated and PDLLA-coated/no
systemic application) following incubation in TSB. The
corresponding agar plates revealed massive bacterial growthwith far above 1000 CFU.
Implant cultures of groups IV and V (uncoated and
PDLLA-coated/with systemic application) were testedpositive for S. aureus in 17 out of 20 animals. These
cultures revealed the same pattern of colony formation asobserved in groups I and II with a homogeneous spread of
bacterial colonies detached from an area according to the
length of the implant ( Figs. 2 b,c). One culture of group IV
(uncoated/with systemic application) and two cultures ofgroup V (PDLLA-coated/with systemic application)remained sterile in culture.
In contrast, 17 out of 20 implant cultures obtained from
animals treated with gentamicin-coated K-wires (groups IIIand VI) remained sterile ( Fig. 2 a). The remaining three

implants revealed only few colonies of S. aureus with a range
from 7 to 136 colonies .These colonies were detached from an
area corresponding only to the tip of the K-wire ( Fig. 2 d).
Cultures of bone powder
S. aureus was cultured from pulverized bone in 17 out
of 20 animals that had received uncoated or PDLLA-coated K-wires (groups I, II, IV, V). The bacterial load
ranged from 1.33 /C210
4to 1.03 /C2105CFU/g bone. The
remaining three cultures of these four groups were foundto be sterile ( Table 2 ).
Only one culture of group III (gentamicin coated/ no
systemic application) was tested positive on S. aureus with a
bacterial load of 7.70 /C210
4CFU/g bone. No bacteria couldbe cultured from pulverized bones in group VI (gentamicin
coated/with systemic application) ( Table 2 ).
Body weight and body temperature
Body weight slightly decreased in all groups during the
first week, but the animals gained weight continuouslythereafter. Mean body weight increased from 262.4 F11.1 g
on day of surgery to 281.2 F16.3 g determined on the day
of sacrifice.
Body temperature remained stable in all groups during the
experimental period. No significant differences of bodyweight and body temperature were found between all groups.
Histological results
All histological slices of groups I (uncoated/no systemic
application) and II (PDLLA/no systemic application)revealed typical signs of bone infection (development ofabscess lesions, destruction of cortical and cancellous bone,periosteal new bone formation) ( Fig. 3 ). These histomor-
phologic appearances also were observed in groups IVTable 2

All four groups of animals that had not been treated with
gentamicin-coated wires (groups I, II, IV, V) had beenassessed with average score values ranging from 9.9 F3.5
(group IV) to 12.2 F2.9 (group I). No statistical differences
were observed between these groups.
The two groups treated with gentamicin-coated wires
(groups III and VI) had been assessed with nearly equal
score values (group III = 1.4 F2.3, group VI = 1.9 F2.6).
The average score values of groups III and VI were found tobe significantly lower in comparison to all other groups(groups I, II, IV, V, Table 1 ).
Discussion
In orthopedic surgery, foreign body materials are
frequently implanted. For many biomaterials, includingmetallic implants, a promoting effect on the developmentof infection could be shown [18,28,34,38] . Implant-related
infection and osteomyelitis still remain feared complica-tions. The treatment is difficult and multiple revisions andlong-term antibiotic therapy are frequently required.
By the present strategies in prosthetic joint surgery, the
rate of infection could be significantly reduced. Ultracleanoperation rooms, improved designs of prosthetic devices,and standardized surgical techniques with a shortening ofoperation times lowered the incidence of infection[5,6,8,49,50] . Perioperative administration of antibiotics
20–40 min prior to surgery also has become an effectiveroutine procedure in prophylaxis [4,6,15,31,33,47] . Failure
to use antibiotics is estimated to result in a sevenfold
increase in the rate of infection [9,32] .
Perioperatively administered antibiotics shall encounter
bacteria within the tissue exposed to possible contaminationduring surgery. In most surgical procedures that include theincorporation of implants, the interface of tissue and implantis especially endangered to be contaminated. Aiming at highprotective tissue levels at the interface prophylaxis by local
application appears as a reasonable approach. Systemic side
effects of the antibiotic can be avoided and higher local druglevels can be achieved without the risk of systemic toxicity.Impaired local blood supply due to surgical trauma,hematoma, and edema may affect the delivery of theantibiotic when administered systemically.
However, certain aspects need to be obeyed if local
prophylaxis is to be performed:
The technique of delivery must guarantee a rapid
release of the antibiotic from the carrier and local druglevels well above the minimal inhibitory concentration(MIC) of current microorganisms need to be achieved.The drug release must be restricted for a limited periodof time to prevent development of resistant bacterialstrains. Bactericidal antibiotics should be favored overbacteriostatic. The use of self-dissolving drug carriers isof advantage as secondary surgery for removal is not
necessary.
In the present study, gentamicin was delivered from a
biodegradable PDLLA coating of titanium implants. Withthe new drug delivery technique, the implant becomesprotected from being colonized by possibly inoculatedbacteria. The antibiotic targets directly the tissue/implantinterface and is liberated with an initial peak. 60% of the
antibiotic is released from the coating within the first 24 h.
After 6 weeks, about 90% are discharged from the coating[26]. In in vivo investigations, gentamicin levels determined
within the bone adjacent to implants yielded 50 Ag/g bone 1
h after implantation. After 1 week, still 8 Ag of gentamicin/g
bone was determined.
As reported earlier, the PDLLA coating degrades by
hydrolysis within 3–6 months after implantation. The
products of degradation are metabolized in the citric acid
cycle [16,20,21,39,40] . The coating provides mechanical
properties suitable to fit the needs for intramedullarynailing [40]. The total loss of the PDLLA coating during
insertion of coated femoral stem prosthesis into humancadaveric femora was determined to be below 5% [11].
Gentamicin was chosen as antibiotic, as it has been
used successfully as locally applied antibiotic in ortho-
pedic surgery [2,19,42,46] . Its broad antimicrobial spec-
trum covering most bacteria commonly involved inosteomyelitis and its bactericidal effect, even on non-proliferating microorganisms [10,42] , make it favorable
for local application.
Isefuku et al., however, reported negative effects of
gentamicin on osteoblast-like cells in vitro [17]. Concen-
trations of 100 Ag/ml and higher inhibited the production
of alkaline phosphatase and cell proliferation in vitro. In
the present study, the amount of gentamicin incorporatedin the used implant coating was approximately 100 Ag/
implant. Therefore, gentamicin levels within the bonedirectly adjacent to the implant will unlikely exceed 100Ag/entire bone. Besides, with the applied concentration,
no negative effects of the locally released gentamicinwere detectable in vivo. Histologically, we observed new
bone formation adjacent to uncoated as well as gentami-
cin-coated implants.
Gentamicin is certainly not an antibiotic of choice for
systemic prophylaxis in clinical use. It was also appliedsystemically in order to achieve comparable circumstancesfor study purpose. However, sufficient serum concentrationswithin the recommended therapeutic range had been assuredby determination of the serum levels shortly before surgery
was performed.
In our experimental setting, we presume the hypothesis
that deep wound infection in clean orthopedic surgery ismainly caused by bacteria seeded during surgery.
Systemic prophylaxis alone reduced the rate of infection
by 15%. In these three out of 20 animals, no radiographicand histomorphological signs of infection became detectableand the implants remained sterile in culture after sacrifice.M. Lucke et al. / Bone 36 (2005) 770–778 776
Applying the same criteria of infection, development of
osteomyelitis could be prevented in 85% out of 20 animalsthat were treated with gentamicin-coated implants. In these20 animals, 10 were treated with a gentamicin-coated implantalone. The other 10 animals had received a combination oflocal and systemic administration of the antibiotic.
The efficacy of gentamicin-coated titanium implants in a
rat model had been reported earlier [24]. In that study, by
insertion of gentamicin-coated implants, onset of infection
could only be prevented in 30% compared to 85% in thepresent study. Different bacterial concentrations used mayexplain this difference. In the former investigations, 10
3CFU
ofS. aureus were inoculated, which is a 10-fold higher in-
oculum compared to the present study. As we have observedby further studies that implant-related osteomyelitis canreliably be established with a lower bacterial inoculum [25],
we decided to use the lowest dose of bacteria necessary to
induce an infection rate of 100%.
In conclusion, the results of the present study show that
local application of gentamicin delivered from a PDLLAcoating of titanium Kirschner wires was very effective inprophylaxis of osteomyelitis. In the presented rat model, thisapplication form led to a higher reduction of the infectionrate compared to a systemic, weight-adopted, single-shot
application of the antibiotic.
With a combination of both administrations, no further
reduction of the infection rate was observed. This might beexplained by following reasons:
1) The local administration is very effective and covers the
effect of the systemic application; thus, a higher samplesize of animals is probably necessary to show a
synergistic effect of both administrations.
2) The application mode of systemic administration was not
appropriate enough in the rat model to achieve sufficientdrug levels at the interface, even though sufficient serumlevels were measured.
In our opinion, local perioperative prophylaxis could be a
useful procedure. Respecting the well-established means of
systemic perioperative prophylaxis of infection, this new
technique could be a supporting approach to prevent deepwound infection in orthopedic surgery.
