ABSTRACT 
In the development of 3-dimensional cell-polymer matrices for tissue engineering, the ability of 
osteoblast cel.ls to maintain their phenotypic properties and form a mineralized matrix while seeded on the 
polymer surface is very important. Osteoblast cell differentiation and bone formation using rat calvaria 
cells were studied on the surface of a porous poly(lactide/glycolide)/hydroxyapatite (PLAGmA) 3- 
dimensional :polymer matrix. Cell adhesion and proliferation were determined at 24 hr, 3, 7, 14, and 2 1 
days. Cell attachment and proliferation were observed to increase throughout the first two weeks of the 
study, followed by a period of gradual plateauing of cell numbers. Environmental scanning electron 
microscopy ‘demonstrated that cells grown on the surface of the 3-dimensional porous PLAGA/HA 
matrix retained their characteristic morphology and grew in a multi-layer fashion. Light microscopy 
observations of experiment cultures revealed active osteoblastic cells forming a characteristic mineralized 
matrix in the presence of B-glycerophosphate as a phosphate donor. Mineralization did not occurred in 
media either not supplemented with l3-glycerophosphate or when the matrix without cells was incubated 
with the reagents, indicating that the mineralization was due to the cells and not the HA in the matrix. 
These results suggest that the 3-dimensional PLAGAJHA matrix could provide a matrix for bone cell 
differentiation and mineralization in vitro and, therefore, may be a candidate as a synthetic implant for 
bone regeneration.

INTRODUCTION 
The development of cell-polymer systems for the tissue engineering of bone has been of 
considerable interest to our laboratory. The lack of availability, occurrence of donor site morbidity, and 
the additional discomfort for the patient that is associated with autografts, and the high cost and risk of 
disease tran,sfer accompanying the use of allografts, has made synthetic materials for grafting very 
attractive. Our focus has been to design a composite of degradable polymers and ceramic materials to 
compensate for shortcomings of each when used alone (9). These materials are biocompatible, non- 
toxic, osteoconductive and may obviate the risks associated with autogenous and allograft bone tissue. 
An ideal material would serve as a scaffold for the growth of new tissue, encourage migration of cells 
from border areas to the defect site, and provide a source of inductive factors to support cell 
differentiation. Mechanically, the graft material should provide initial strength for a healing process to

begin, yet allow load-bearing activity to be shifted gradually from the implant to the developing skeletal 
tissue. 
Our previous studies examined osteoblast cell attachment and growth on the surface of 2- 
dimensional 5050 copolymer of poly(lactide/glycolide) (PLAGA) reinforced by a particulate calcium 
phosphate ceramic, hydroxyapatite (HA) (11). It is proposed that the ability of anchorage-dependent 
cells, such as osteoblasts, to adhere to the surface of a matrix is essential for cell proliferation (17). 
Studies have shown that the 2-dimensional polymer discs exhibited a favorable surface for both cellular 
adhesion and proliferation. Therefore, we formulated a 3-dimensional porous polymer/ceramic 
composite of 5050 PLAGA/HA using novel processing techniques (9). A 3-dimensional porous 
polymer matrix has a greater surface area than a 2-dimensional system that is available for cell anchorage, 
growth, and migration, as well as channels for the transport of nutrients and effector molecules (1 ,lO). 
The fabrication method used for the 3-dimensional system creates a matrix composed of polymeric 
microspheres. The 3-dimensional macroporous matrices produced structurally resembled cancellous bone 
in their porosity (9). The matrices were mechanically comparable to cancellous bone as their 
compressive elastic modulus lied within the boundaries for cancellous bone (9). The polymer matrices 
were also chemically similar to cancellous bone in that they contained the calcium phosphate ceramic 
hydroxyapatite (9). The channels between the polymeric microspheres were pores approximately lOO- 
150 ym in diameter (9). The minimum pore diameter required for ingrowth of cells into the interior of 
the matrices is 100 l.trn (12). 
We also have demonstrated that osteoblasts adhere, proliferate and migrate throughout the pores of 
this 3-dimensional matrix (2,3). These cells expressed alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) as well as 
osteocalcin (2). Expression of ALP activity is an excepted phenotypic marker for osteoblasts (16), and 
osteocalcin purportedly plays an important role during bone mineralization(6,7,13,14). 
The object of the reported in vitro study was to examine the ability of osteoblast cells isolated from 
rat calvaria to differentiate and proliferate on 3-dimensional PLAGA/HA composites throughout a 2 1 day 
period, and to demonstrate for the first time, the formation of a mineralized matrix on the surface of this 
polymer. The ability of osteoblast cells to form mineralized nodules in vitro suggests the cells have 
differentiated (5). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Matrix Fabrication 
The fabrication method for 3-dimensional macroporous polymer-ceramic composites has been 
described previously (8,9). A 40% w/v solution of 50:50 poly(lactide/glycolide) copolymer (PLAGA), 
[DuPont Medisorb, lot S2127 S 1441 in chloroform was used to suspend particulate hydroxyapatite 
(HA), [Howmedica, lot HAG 89272B] and NaCl crystals. A w/w ratio of polymer to salt of 1: 1 was 
used. NaCl crystals were ground and sifted to loo-250 l,trn in diameter. A 1% solution of polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA) [Polysciences, lot #413322, MW 25,000] was added to the suspension in a 3:7 volume 
ratio to chloroform. The resulting emulsion was cast to cylindrical molds, air dried for 48 hours, and 
vacuum dried for an additional 48 hours. Matrices were removed from molds and subject to immersion 
in deionized water at 37 ‘C for 48 hours to leach the salt crystals. Polymer samples were dried 48 hours 
in air and 48 hours under vacuum then sectioned. The resulting 3-dimensional matrices had a 
macroporous pore size averaging 1 OO- 150l.t.m in diameter. Polymer samples were exposed to ultraviolet 
light for 30 minutes on each side for sterilization, 
Cell Culture 
Primary osteoblast cultures were established using the method described by Schwartz (20). 
Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat calvaria were excised surgically and cleaned in Tyrode’s balanced solution 
containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 I.U./ml and 10,000 mcg/ml, respectively) (Sigma 
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The calvaria were subjected to sequential collagenase/trypsin digestions. 
Digestion solution was prepared by dissolving 137 mg collagenase (type I, Worthington Biochemicals) 
and 50 mg trypsin (Sigma, type III) in 10 ml PBS solution. Each digestion population was centrifuged, 
resuspended and plated onto 75 cm2 polystyrene tissue culture flasks. Cells were grown to confluency in 
Ham’s F-12 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 12% fetal bovine serum (Sigma)

and maintained. at 37°C with 5% CO,. Media was changed after the first 24 hours and then every 
subsequent 48 hours. 
Cell Proliferation 
The wells of tissue culture plates (24 well, Falcon) were coated with 12% 
poly(hydroxyethylmetbacrylate) (Polysciendes, Warrington, PA) to ensure that cells would only grow on 
and throughout the polymer discs and not on the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surface. Sterilized, 
inert, silicon-based, high temperature vacuum grease (VWR Scientific, San Francisco, CA) was used to 
hold the polymer discs to the bottom of TCPS wells. Cells were plated onto the surface of the polymer 
discs at a plating number of 1~10~ cells per well. Cell populations were cultured on the polymer matrices 
as described above. 
Cell proliferation was determined at 24 hours, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. At each time point, media 
was removed from the TCPS wells. The discs were washed gently with PBS to remove any unattached 
cells and remai:ning media. The adherent cells were removed from the substrate by incubation in 1 ml of 
0.25% trypsin in EDTA (Sigma) for 5 min. and then discs were washed with 2 ml of media. Cells in the 
trypsin/media solution were removed, centrifuged together, and then resuspended in fresh media. Cells 
were counted with a hemacytometer using a trypan blue exclusion technique. Each time point was 
performed in triplicate. Matrices were visualized by environmental scanning electron microscopy 
(ESEM) to ensure the complete removal of cells by trypsin. 
Electron Microscouv 
Polymer-cell samples were prepared as stated above and examined with an AMR Model 1000 
environmental scanning -electron n&oscope (ESEM). Contrary to conventional scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) which requires extensive preparation and sample coating, ESEM allows both the cells 
and polymer to be observed with minimal disturbance. ESEM was carried out at an accelerating voltage 
of 15 kV under 4.9 torr at 6% humidity. 
Mineralization 
Calvarial rat osteoblast (ROB) cells were seeded and grown on 3-dimensional PLAGAIHA 
polymer disks for 11 days and then subsequently incubated for 10 more days in medium supplemented 
with 10 mM ascorbic acid at 50 mg/ml and 5 mM glucose. The cells were fixed with a solution of 5% 
glacial acetic acid and 70% ethanol and stained by the von Kossa method (13). Osteoblast cells cultured 
on 3-dimensional PLAGA/HA matrices in media unsupplemented with &glycerophosphate and also 
matrices without cells were used as controls. Mineralization was visualized using normal light 
microscopy. 
RESULTS 
Cell Proliferation 
Osteoblast cell attachment and proliferation were examined on 3-dimensional degradable polymer- 
ceramic matrices over a 21 day period. Cell numbers were measured at 24 hours, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days 
(figure 1). After the first 24 hours, cultures exceeded the plating density (1~10~ cells), demonstrating 
that during this time cells were able to adhere to the surface and proliferate. Cell growth continued 
throughout the first 14 days, after which, growth appeared to plateau. 
Electron Microscouv 
Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) showed that cells at day 14 and beyond 
retained their polygonal morphology and grew in the characteristic multi-layer fashion (figure 2). The 
multi-layer growth, as well as 3-dimensional nodule formation, previously were found to be necessary 
for in vitro mineralization (4,5,19). 
Mineralization 
The osteoblast cells formed a mineralizable matrix when cultured in the presence of the phosphate 
donor (figure 3a). No mineralization occurred when the media was not supplemented with l3- 
glycerophospha.te or when the matrix alone was incubated with the reagents (figure 3b). Therefore, the 
mineralization was due to the cells alone and not HA present in the 3-dimensional matrix. Mineral 
deposits were seen as dark areas throughout the matrix.

DISCUSSION 
Many research efforts have been organized to develop biodegradable polymers for tissue 
regeneration ( 15,2 1,22). We have demonstrated a novel technique for the fabrication of the 3- 
dimensional 5050 copolymer of poly(lactide/glycolide) (PLAGA) reinforced by a particulate calcium 
phosphate ceramic, hydroxyapatite (HA) (9). This method produces 3-dimensional macroporous 
polymer-ceramic matrices with potential as a bone grafting material. These 3-dimensional matrices 
structurally, mechanically and chemically resemble cancellous bone (9). 
In examining the cellular responses to synthetic materials, in vitro studies of cell/substrate 
interactions and cellular proliferation and differentiation must be performed. Our cell studies, using 
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy techniques (2,3), have shown that osteoblast cells migrate 
through the macropores, become attached, and proliferate in the interior of the matrix. These 
proliferative cells demonstrated retention of characteristic osteoblast phenotypes by eliciting positive tests 
for both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin. The production of ALP is an early marker of a 
committed osteoblast (18). Osteocalcin is a protein specific to osteoblasts and is vital for the formation of 
a mineralized matrix (6,13). In the reported in vitro study, osteoblasts isolated from rat calvaria and 
seeded on the surface of the 3-dimensional PLAGA/HA matrix, proliferated throughout a 2 1 day period, 
retained their characteristic morphology, and grew in a multi-layer fashion to form bone when cultured in 
the presence of l3-glycerophosphate. 
The increased surface area of the 3-dimensional porous polymer matrices provides sufficient area 
available for cell anchorage, growth and migration (1,lO). At the end of the first 24 hours of this study, 
the number of cells adhering to the polymer exceeded the cell plating density. After 24 hours, the 
number of adhering cells continued to increase until day 14, at which time the cell numbers appeared to 
plateau. 
Polymer-cell samples at day 14 and 21 were examined by environmental scanning electron 
microscopy (ESEM). The ESEM micrographs revealed that osteoblasts growing on the surface of the 3- 
dimensional PLAGA/HA matrix retained their characteristic polygonal morphology. Micrographs also 
demonstrated cells grew in a multi-layer fashion. Studies have shown that when cells are maintained in 
culture for an extended period of time, they continue to proliferate postconfluence in foci that are 
scattered throughout the monolayer (5). With continued culture, these foci can develop into three- 
dimensional structures that are usually referred to as “nodules.” These nodules stain intensely positive 
for the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (4,5,18), a good marker for osteoblast cell differentiation . 
When cultured in the presence of B-glycerophosphate, osteoblast cells seeded on the surface of 
the 3-dimensional porous PLAGA/HA matrix formed a mineralized matrix by 2 1 days. Mineralized foci 
were seen as dark areas dispersed throughout the field of view. The ability of these osteoblast cells to 
form a mineralized matrix in vitro suggests that the cells have differentiated to the extent of being able to 
form a structure that resembles bone formed in viva (5). This is the first study to demonstrate the ability 
of synthetic bioerodible polymer-ceramic matrices to support bone cell mineralization and confirms that 
PLAGA/HA provides an excellent matrix for osteoblast differentiation and subsequent mineralization. 
Current studies using the 3-dimensional PLAGA/HA matrix will measure and analyze in vitro the 
presence of calcium in the mineralized matrix. Methods of analyzation include scanning electron 
microscopy (both energy dispersive x-ray (SEM/EDX) and wavelength dispersive x-ray (SEMBVDX)), 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These 
techniques allow for accurate quantification and localization of the carbano-apatite deposited by 
osteoblasts. Future studies will examine mineralized matrix formation of osteoblasts seeded on the 
polymer in an in vivo environment, using a non-union bone model, as well as investigate the 
characteristics of the bone/polymer interface in vivo.
