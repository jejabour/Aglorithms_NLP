Histomorphometric studies were conducted in rats to deter- 
mine whether bone particles would disturb new hone forma- 
tion on the interface of titanium implants inserted after 
reaming of the marrow cavity. In eighty 10-week-old female 
Wistar rats, smooth-surfaced titanium alloy implants were 
inserted bilaterally into the marrow cavity after reaming in 
the distal femur. There were three experimental groups: in 
the irrigated femora, sterile saline was flushed through the 
medullary canal; in the particle femora, autologous bone par- 
ticles were inserted into the intramedullary cavity; and in the 
reamed femora, the implant was inserted without procedures 
after reaming. The rats were sacrificed at one, two, four or 
eight weeks postoperatively, and Villanueva bone staining 
was applied for histomorphometric studies. The hone volume 
of new bone on the interface of the implant in the irrigated 
femora was greater than that in the particle or the reamed 
femora throughout the study period. The results suggest that 
clearance of bone particles by irrigation after reaming of the 
marrow cavity significantly facilitates new bone formation on 
the interface of implants by one week. The findings also sug- 
gest the potential clinical application of total canal irrigation 
prior to insertion of cementless femoral components as well 
as cemented prosthesis. (Bone 19:589-594; 1996) © 1996 by

Introduction 
Excellent results are obtained when arthroplasty components are 
implanted with cement using modem cementing techniques such 
as retrograde filling of a plugged medullary canal with a cement 
gun. 2'9 It is generally recommended that before insertion of the 
cement, the canal should be thoroughly irrigated to remove loose 
debris, bone marrow, and blood. 7 Uncemented total hip replace- 
ment with several porous surfaces was developed to provide 
mechanical fixation by means of bone growth into the porous 
spaces of the implant. 6a~'12 Galante et al. observed bone in- 
growth at 6 weeks in a wire mesh system that produced the same 
stability as a bone-cement interface. 3 To gain earlier ingrowth 
and form a strong bond, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, 
and other calcium-phosphate ceramic-coated implants are pres-

metal implants as providing more rapid and voluminous bone 
ingrowth in rabbits than did uncoated implants. TM However, the 
effect of irrigation of the canal prior to insertion of cementless 
femoral components has not been thoroughly investigated, nor 
have the effects of bone particles on new bone formation after 
marrow cavity reaming been documented. The purpose of this 
study is to clarify the effect of bone particles on new bone 
formation on the interface of the implant in the marrow cavity 
after reaming, using histomorphometry and bone mineral 
measurements. 
Materials and Methods 
Operative Technique and Grouping 
Eighty 10-week-old female Wistar rats were anesthetized intra- 
peritoneally with 25 mg/kg of Nembutal (Abbott Laboratories, 
North Chicago, 1L). The aseptic surgical technique was used. The 
intercondylar area of the femur was exposed through a 15 mm 
longitudinal incision using the medial parapatellar approach. The 
distal femoral canal was reamed through the intercondylar notch 
with a stainless steel drill, creating a hole 1.6 mm in diameter and 
15 mm in depth. Each femur was treated by one of three groups 
as follows: in the irrigated femora, 10 mL of sterile saline was 
flushed into the medullary cavity using a 23-gauge needle; in the 
particle femora, 14 mg of autologous bone particles harvested 
from the gutter of the drill, the amount of which was almost 70% 
of the whole ones, were inserted into the medullary cavity; and 
in the reamed femora, reaming alone was performed (Table 1). 
The bone particles are supposed to contain dead blood cells, 
denatured bone marrow, coagula, and so on. The smooth- 
surfaced titanium alloy (Ti-6A1-4V) (Nippon Kokan, Tokyo) im- 
plant, 1.6 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length, was then inserted 
into the medullary canal (Figure 1). The right femora of the rats 
were used for the irrigated or particle femora as the experimental 
group, and the left femora was used for the reamed femora as the 
standard group. The rats were sacrificed at one, two, four, or 
eight weeks postoperatively. All femora were microradiographed 
at the time of sacrifice. 
Histological Study 
Twenty-eight femora in each of the irrigated and the particle 
femora, and 56 in the reamed femora, were labeled with calcein 
(Dozin Kagaku, Kumamoto) the day before the operation, and 
double labeling with tetracycline (Pfizer, Tokyo) was performed 
on the 6th and 3rd days before sacrifice. This represents a 1-2- 
1-2 labeling schedule. The femur was fixed in 70% ethanol,

stained with Villanueva bone stain, and embedded in methyl- 
methacrylate. Transverse sections from the diaphysis of the fe- 
mur at the level of the middle one-third of the implant (Figure 
2A) were cut to the thickness of 10 ~m using a cutting machine 
(EXAKT, BS-3000, Meiwa, Osaka, Japan) and microgrinding 
machine (EXAKT, MG-4000, Meiwa, Osaka, Japan). Histomor- 
phometric measurements were performed using a digitizing sys- 
tem (System Supply, Nagano, Japan) in 28 specimens in each of 
the irrigated, particle, and reamed femora in which 28 specimens 
were selected from among 56 at random. The following measures 
of the bone volume of new bone in the marrow cavity were 
determined: bone volume on the interface of the implant (BV.I); 
bone volume of new bone present in the marrow cavity 
(BV.Ma.); and bone volume of the endosteum, which was mea- 
sured between the calcein-labeled area and the innermost endos- 
teum (BV.Es.) (Figure 3). And to compare with each sample, the 
bone volume rate of new bone in the marrow cavity was calcu- 
lated for the percentage of new bone in the marrow cavity ex- 
cluding the implant area (BV.Ma/Ma.V). The bone volume rate 
of the endosteum was calculated for the percentage of bone vol- 
ume of the endosteum in total core (BV.Es/Tt). 
The most distal portion of 12 irrigated, 12 particle, and 24 
reamed femora was removed carefully using bone-cutting for- 
ceps to expose the distal portion of the implant, and an attempt 
was made to retrieve the implant. However, in 12 femora exam- ined eight weeks postoperatively, the implants could not be re- 
trieved, and thus only 36 specimens were fixed in cold formalin. 
After decalcification with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA), the femora were divided into two sagittal sections and 
embedded in glycol methacrylate, which was then polymerized 
in cold storage. Sagittal sections were cut to a thickness of 5 txm 
using a Jung K microtome (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo) and stained with 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The number of 
TRAP-stained cells having more than two nuclei together with 
mononuclear, that were bone resorbing cells, was determined for 
the interface area 5 mm proximal to the epiphyseal plate in a total 
of 10 fields with an original magnification of 200x, for a total 
measured area of 1 mm 2, for the irrigated and the particle femora 
(Figure 2B). 
Densitometr 3, 
The bone mineral density (BMD) of 36 femora harvested at one, 
two, and four weeks postoperatively, in which all of the implants 
could be retrieved, was measured with a dual-energy X-ray ab- 
sorptiometry unit (DXA) (Hologic QDR--1000/W, Hologic, 
Waltham, MA). The area of measurement was the diaphysis of 
the femur, at the level of the proximal half of the implant (Figure 
2A).

tive statistics. The differences between pairs of the various

Results 
Radiography 
Microradiographs of the specimens made at the time of sacrifice 
demonstrated that all implants were well integrated into the sur- 
rounding bone; there were no fractures (Figure 1). 
Histomorphometric and Histological Study 
The bone volume on the interface of the implant (BV.I) in the 
irrigated femora was greater than that at the same number of 
weeks in the particle or the reamed femora. Woven bone was 
seen in the irrigated femora as early as one week, while in the 
other groups no bone formation was observed at this time (Fig- 
ure 4). At two weeks, woven bone formation was observed in the 
particle and the reamed femora, and thereafter the BV.I in all groups increased time dependently. The magnitude of increase in 
the irrigated femora was significantly higher than that in each of 
the other groups at one week (p < 0.01) and at eight weeks (p < 
0.05) (Figure 5). Abundant lamellar bone formation in the irri- 
gated femora exceeding that in the particle femora at eight weeks 
is shown in Figure 6. 
There was an initial peak of the bone volume rate of new bone 
in the marrow cavity (BV.Ma/Ma.V) in the irrigated femora at 
one week followed by a subsequent decrease and final rise at 
eight weeks. Although the changes with time were similar in the 
particle or the reamed femora, there was an initial delay of one 
week. There was a significant difference between the BV.Ma/ 
Ma.V in the irrigated femora and that in each of the other two 
groups at one week (p < 0.01), and a significant difference was 
also seen at eight weeks between those in the irrigated and the 
reamed femora (p < 0.01) (Table 2). 
The bone volume rate of the endosteum (BV.Es/Tt) showed 
increase with time similar to the BV.I (Table 2). New bone 
formation was first noted in the irrigated femora at one week, 
while that in the other groups was first noted at two weeks. 
Significant differences were observed at one and two weeks (p < 
0.05, comparing the Irrigated vs. either particle or reamed femora 
at one week; and p < 0.01, the irrigated vs. reamed femora at two 
weeks). Also, there was a positive correlation between BV.I and 
BV.Es/Tt in each group (p < 0.01) (Figure 7). 
Mineralizing surface of the interface of the implant (MS/OS) 
in the irrigated femora increased after one week and then de- 
creased after four weeks, while that in the particle and the reamed 
femora increased from two to four weeks and decreased there- 
after. Significant differences were noted at two and eight weeks 
(p < 0.01, the irrigated vs. either particle or reamed femora at two 
weeks; p < 0.05, the reamed vs. either irrigated or particle femora 
at eight weeks) (Table 2). 
Woven bone rate of bone volume of the interface of the 
implant showed 100% for the irrigated femora in which new 
bone formation was observed at one week, and then decreased 
with time. At eight weeks new bone consisted almost entirely of 
lamellar bone. Also, there was not a significant difference in each 
group (Table 2). 
The percentage of total area of bone particles in the marrow 
cavity (Bp/Ma.V) in the particle and the reamed femora de- 
creased from 12.96% and 1.42%, respectively, at one week to 
3.43% and 0.18%, respectively, at two weeks. At four weeks and 
beyond, no bone particles were seen in either group. The average

Figure 5. The course of the bone volume on the interface of the implant 
(BV.I) in the irrigated, the particle and the reamed femora. The bone 
volume was consistently higher in the irrigated femora than in the other 
two groups, and the differences were significant at one and eight weeks

size of the bone particle in the particle and the reamed femora 
was 2964 and 2725 ixm 2 at one week, and 2347 and 1120 ixm 2 
at two weeks. For the irrigated femora, no bone particles were 
seen throughout the study period (Table 2). 
The number of TRAP-stained cells measured in both the ir- 
rigated and the particle femora is shown in Table 2. The number 
of cells in the particle femora was greater than that in the irri- 
gated femora at one and two weeks, but a significant difference 
was not obtained because of the small sample size in each group. 
DXA 
The value of the BMD at one to four weeks was highest in the 
particle femora, followed by the reamed and the irrigated femora 
(Table 2). There was a significant difference in BMD at one 
week between the particle and the irrigated femora (p < 0.01 ) and 
between the reamed and the irrigated femora (p < 0.05). Discussion 
Several articles referring to the repair of hemopoietic bone mar- 
row following evacuation of a long bone cavity have been pre- 
sentedJ 'm'13 Amsel et alJ demonstrated that the reparative pro- 
cess following bone marrow ablation consisted of capillary in- 
vasion of the cavity, appearance of primitive mesenchymal cells, 
osteoblastic proliferation, woven bone formation, development 
of sinusoids, reappearance of hemopoietic tissue, and resorption 
of bone tissue that preceded the appearance of regenerated nor- 
mal marrow. The woven bone that appeared after injury was 
thought to be produced by endosteal osteoblasts and osteoblasts 
derived from cells residing in normal hemopoietic tissue.1 The 
nature of the triggering stimulus is unknown, but it is probably 
related to disruption of the continuity of the marrow stroma and 
endosteum, m In this study the positive correlation between the 
bone volume of the interface and that of the endosteum (Figure 
7) indicates that the marrow stroma and endosteum reacted in a 
body. Thus, it may be that the endosteum plays a role in repair of 
the marrow cavity and that the origin of the regeneration cells 
could be none other than the endosteum. The repair of bone 
marrow for insertion of heterotopic titanium implant after ream- 
ing of the marrow cavity seems to be not very different from 
bone marrow ablation alone. 
The irrigated femora showed bone formation at the three ar- 
eas from an early stage. The particle and the reamed femora 
showed bone formation with almost one-week delay compared to 
that of the irrigated femora. The course of change for the bone 
volume of new bone in the three areas and the mineralizing 
surface in the particle and the reamed femora also showed similar 
one-week delay throughout the study period. One reason for the 
delay in bone formation in these two groups compared to the 
irrigated femora may be a time lag of capillary invasion toward 
the titanium implant. Weiss reported that the major arterial sup- 
ply of the marrow in the long bones (the nutrient arteries) was 
oriented along the central longitudinal axis, while the sinusoidal 
system extended radially from the arteries at the periphery to the 
central longitudinal veinJ 6 Because of disruption of this major 
artery and sinusoidal system by reaming, which may result in 
local necrosis due to the heat of the high-speed drilling, capillary 
invasion of the cavity apparently originates from the endosteum. 
Therefore, the presence of many bone particles in the marrow 
cavity might disturb capillary invasion toward the implant. 
In the particle femora, the reduction of bone particles in the

marrow cavity was seen at two weeks, together with the increase 
of the number of TRAP-stained cells at one week, peaking at two 
weeks, and declining to become almost negligible after four 
weeks. Thus, the total resorption of bone particles seems to re- 
quire one or two weeks. The bone formation in this group seemed 
to follow resorption of the bone particles, which may be another 
reason for the delayed change compared with that in the irrigated 
femora. In the irrigated femora, the woven bone would be formed 
soon after irrigation as in the bone marrow regeneration after 
local injury, m while in the particle and the reamed femora, the 
woven bone may be formed by the two processes of the bone 
marrow regeneration after local injury as in the irrigated femora 
and the bone formation following resorption of bone particles. 
The latter process is speculated to be the more major in these 
groups. The osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes 
within bone particles are assumed to be not viable because no viable cells were observed in bone particles by histological ex- 
amination at one week. However, bone particles contain local 
osteoinductive factors such as bone morphogenic protein 
(BMP) 15 and so on in their matrix, and these local factors may 
play an important role in this process. There were more bone 
particles, and there was thus presumably more exposure to these 
local factors in the particle femora than in the reamed femora. 
Therefore, the bone volume of new bone in the three areas in the 
particle femora might appear higher than that in the reamed 
femora, although there was no significant difference between 
them (Figure 5, Table 2). On the other hand, irrigating the mar- 
row itself may stimulate osteoblastic activity from the endosteum 
independent of the role of any bone particles. However, there is 
no evidence for this. Further investigation is needed. 
The comparatively higher BMD values at one week in the 
particle femora relative to the irrigated femora perhaps reflect

residual bone particles (Table 2). In the irrigated femora at the 
same interval, extensive woven bone prolilL'ration was observed, 
but the woven bone was apparently not detected as bone mineral 
when measured by DXA. The mineralizing surface of the inter- 
face of the implant in the irrigated femora increased beginning at 
two weeks, but that in the particle femora was not detected at this 
time. Hence, the difference of BMD between the irrigated and 
the particle femora seemed to diminish at four weeks. 
The implants in this study were not subjected to the stress and 
early weight-bearing, which produces micromotion, but clear- 
ance of bone particles by irrigation on the interface of the implant 
after reaming of the marrow cavity significantly increased bone 
formation from an early stage. Additional studies are required to 
investigate the effects of bone particles on the porous surfaces of 
implants or on the interface of hydroxyapatite or other calcium- 
phosphate ceramic-coated implants. Also, clinically, for cavitary 
deficits in the proximal femur after removal of a loosed prosthe- 
sis at revision of total hip arthroplasty, a cancellous bone graft is 
useful for filling small deficits adjacent to a stem that is me- 
chanically stable by virtue of its fit within the canal. 7 The fate of 
this grafted bone is unknown, but our findings suggest that bone 
particles that seem to be smaller and do not have better quality 
than these cancellous bone are fated to be resorbed and disturb 
facilitation of new bone formation on the interface of implants. 
In conclusion, clearance of bone particles by irrigation on the 
interface of the implant after reaming of the marrow cavity sig- 
nificantly increases new bone formation from an early stage. This 
may have clinical application in the form of total canal irrigation 
prior to insertion of cementless femoral components, as well as 
cemented prostheses.
