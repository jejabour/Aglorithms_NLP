The etiology of osteoporosis is multifactorial, but there is
evidence from both animal and human studies that thevolume of marrow adipose tissue increases when bone vol-ume is reduced in osteoporosis. The cell-related mechanismthat may account for this inverse relationship between thevolume of marrow adipose tissue and bone remains to beclarified, although it is known that both adipocytes andosteoblasts are derived from stromal cell precursors in bonemarrow. We report that retroviral transduction with a tem-perature-sensitive oncogene (SV40 large T antigen) can gen-erate bipotential cell lines from human marrow stroma thatare capable of directed differentiation, in vitro, down eitheran osteogenic or adipocytic lineage pathway. One such clone,designated hOP 7, expresses type a1(I) procollagen and has
low alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity under basal cultureconditions that is reminiscent of an osteoprogenitor cell.Exposure of hOP 7 cells to dexamethasone upregulates APactivity and enables the cells to mineralize their extracellularmatrix. Also, treatment with calcitriol induces osteocalcinexpression and both PTH and PGE

formation. Incubation with normal rabbit serum, however,causes the cells to become adipogenic as demonstrated byhistological staining with Oil-red-O, expression of mRNA forthe early and late adipocyte markers lipoprotein lipase andglycerol3-phosphatedehydrogenase,respectively,andlossoftype a1(I) procollagen mRNA. The generation of homoge-
neous populations of these cells, as confirmed by Southernblot analysis, demonstrates the capacity of a human clonalcell line to differentiate in either an osteogenic or adipogenicdirection.

Introduction
The pathogenesis of osteoporosis is multifactorial, but a consistent
finding in osteoporosis, and in osteopenia, is a gain in marrow fatvolume coinciding with a loss of trabecular bone.
8,27,29Since the
discovery by Friedenstein, Owen, and others,13,14,16,22,24,28,32that
marrow stromal stem cells give rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes,myoblasts,chondroblasts,andfibroblasts(forreview,seeReference1), a cellular mechanism has been sought to account for the inverserelationship between marrow fat volume and trabecular bone massseen in these forms of skeletal disease.
Animal cell studies provide convincing evidence for the exis-
tence of stromal cells that can differentiate to osteoblasts andadipocytes,
3and of an inverse relationship between the differentia-
tion of adipocytic and osteogenic cells.4Support for such a phe-
nomenon in humans also comes from Rickard et al.33who demon-
strated that marrow stroma derived human colony forming units-fibroblast (CFU-Fs) would differentiate to either osteoblasts oradipocytes depending on culture conditions. Furthermore, evidencethat a single, bipotential precursor cell, rather than two independentcell types, may be responsible for adipocyte/osteoblast phenotypeswitchingisprovidedbyDorheimetal.
12Theyhaveshownthatthe
murine stromal cell lines BMS2 and 1/12.4, which undergo adi-
pogenesis in the presence of fetal bovine serum, will expressmarkers of osteoblastic cells when in a preadipocytic state.
Thepresentstudyprovidesinvitroevidencethathumanmarrow
precursor cells can be directed to differentiate down the adipocyticor osteoblastic lineage. Human marrow stromal cells were retrovi-rally transduced with a temperature-sensitive form of the simianvirus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40-T) and replicating cell clonesgenerated.Onesuchclone,designatedhumanosteoprogenitorclone7 (hOP 7), was shown to have characteristics of an osteoblastprecursor under basal culture conditions, and could be induced toexpress the mature osteoblastic phenotype.

cursor cell clone provides support for the hypothesis that osteo-
genesis and adipogenesis are regulated at the level of a commonmarrow precursor cell. Also, the generation of this cell lineprovides another tool with which to determine the factors thatinfluence human marrow stromal cell differentiation. This, inturn, may provide further understanding of the mechanisms bywhich marrow fat volume increases during aging and in diseasesof the skeleton where a loss of trabecular bone mass occurs.

Isolation, Transduction, and Culture of Human Marrow
Stromal Cells
Fresh human ribs were used as a source of marrow stromal cells.
For the cell lines described in this study, the rib was obtainedfrom a 68-year-old woman undergoing thoracic surgery, with noprior history of bone disease. The surgically removed rib wasimmediately washed twice with sterile phosphate buffered saline(PBS) and all adherent tissue scraped off. The rib was then splitintotwohalvesexposingthemarrowcavity.Themarrow-derivedcells were transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at100gfor5mintoharvestthecells.Theoverlyingmediumandfatdeposits were removed, and the cell pellet resuspended in 5 mLof fresh medium. The resuspended cells were loaded onto a 70%Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 460g for 15 min. Followingcentrifugation, the top 25% of the gradient volume, containingthe low density osteoblast precursor cells,
18was removed. To
this suspension an equal volume of fresh medium was added andthe suspension centrifuged at 100g for 10 min. The resulting cellpellet was resuspended in fresh medium, a single cell solutionprepared, and the number of viable cells determined by thetrypan blue (1% w/v) exclusion method.

comprising: a-MEM culture medium, glutamine, nonessential
amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic, 100 mg/mL
G418, and 10% heat inactivated FCS. The flasks were incubatedat37°Cfor3daystoallowcellstoadhere.Thenonadherentcellswere then removed and the medium replaced with basal mediumcontaining an amphotropically packaged retroviral shuttle vectorcomprising ts-SV40-T plus selection marker (which allowedsurvival of the transduced cells when incubated in the presenceof geneticin G418—see Materials), and polybrene to a final
concentration of 8 mg/mL. The cells were incubated with virus
containingmediumfor2hrat37°C,afterwhichthemediumwasreplaced with basal medium and the cells incubated at 33°C, thepermissive temperature for biologically active ts-SV40-T onco-gene expression. Two days later, geneticin (G418) was added tothe medium at a final concentration of 400 mg/mL to select for
cells that had been transduced with, and were actively express-ing, the ts-SV40-T containing retroviral vector. Basal mediumwith added G418 was replenished every 3 days.
After 2 weeks at 33°C, only geneticin-resistant cells survived,
each giving rise to a discrete colony of homogeneous ts-SV40-Timmortalized cells. To aid single colony cloning, the transductionefficiency was reduced by diluting the virus so that only 20 repli-cating clones, on average, were present per T75 tissue culture flask.This allowed for the separate ring cloning of individual colonies of100–1000 replicating cells.
39A resistant colony, designated hOP 7,
was recovered by ring cloning and passaged into a single well of a96-wellplatebeforethecolonycellnumberswereexpandedat33°Cand passaged into tissue culture flasks.
The G418 resistant and replicating cell clone hOP 7 was
expandedattheoncogene’spermissivetemperature,andthecellsroutinely passaged either once or twice per week, ensuring thatthe cells never reached confluence. All experiments were carriedout in the same basal medium unless otherwise stated.
Generation of Growth Curves
Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 2500, 5000,
or10,000cells/cm
2andincubatedat33°C.Thenumberofviable
cells were determined, at regular intervals, by trypan blue exclu-sionandcountedwithahemocytometeruntilcellconfluencewasreached. Replicate plates were also incubated at 39°C.
Immunocytochemistry
The large T antigen was localized by immunofluorescence after
fixing subconfluent cells with ice-cold methanol and acetone (1:1ratio) for 20 min. A 1:20 dilution in PBS of the SV40-T antigenspecific mouse monoclonal IgG was incubated with the fixed cellsat37°Cfor1hr.Cellswerealsoincubatedwithanirrelevantmousemonoclonal IgG, or with PBS alone, both serving as negativecontrols. The cells were washed twice with PBS and a secondantibody, goat anti-mouse IgG fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugate, was incubated with the control and treated cells, also ata 1:20 dilution in PBS at 37°C for 1 hr. Excess antibody was thenremoved by four washes with PBS and the cells overlayed withimmu-mount prior to fluorescence microscopy.8 A. Houghton et al. Bone Vol. 22, No. 1

Western Blot Analysis
Protein was isolated from hOP 7 cells, from NIH3T3 (T antigen
negative) cells, and from the amphotropic packaging T antigenpositive cell line, PA317tsA58, using TRIzol as directed by themanufacturers. Protein derived from the three cells types wasthen electrophoresed through a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel andtransferred to a hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filter using standardprocedures.
34The filter was immersed in a blocking solution
containing non-fat dry milk before incubation with SV40-Tantibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. After 1 hr incuba-tion, the filter was washed four times in PBS and then incubatedfor 1 hr with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase diluted 1:1000 with blocking solution. Afterfour washes in PBS, the filter was immersed in freshly preparedDABsolutionandreactionproductallowedtodevelopfor3min.
Staining of Mineralized Matrix
The basal medium of postconfluent hOP 7 cells was supple-
mented with 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid and 10
23mol/L b-glycer-
ophosphate, and cells incubated in the presence or absence of10
27mol/L dexamethasone at 39°C for 28 days. Cell cultures
were then washed in PBS and fixed in 10% (v/v) bufferedformaldehyde in saline for 10 min at room temperature, andstained by a modification of the von Kossa method.
11Briefly the
cultureswereincubatedwithasilvernitratesolutionandexposedto ultraviolet light for 1 hr. Excess silver nitrate was washedaway and the cultures treated with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 5min at room temperature. The cultured cells were subsequentlywashed twice with distilled water and allowed to dry in air.
Osteocalcin Assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 10
4cells/cm2and grown to
confluence at 33°C before treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3or vehi-
cle (ethanol, 0.1% v/v) at 39°C. Osteocalcin levels were assayed
by an immunoradiometric assay, which detects both intact os-teocalcin and its large N terminal and midfragment. Conditioned
media were harvested from hOP 7 cells after incubation withvitamin D
3or vehicle for 8 days. Media were stored at 280°C
immediately after harvesting, the sampled media having beenincubated with the cells for a total of 48 hr prior to its collectionand storage.
Alkaline Phosphatase Assay
Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was measured by a modifi-
cationofthecolorimetricmethodinitiallydescribedbyBesseyetal.
6Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by washing the cells
several times in PBS, scraping the cell layer into 200 mLo f
ice-cold 0.1% Triton-X 100, and subjecting the samples to mildsonication. Aliquots of the samples were then incubated withprewarmed substrate solution (0.1 mol/L diethanolamine, 1mmol/L MgCl
2, and 2 mmol/L p-NPP pH 10.5) for 1 hr, after
which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 mol/LNaOH. Samples were assayed spectrophotometrically at 410 nmand the final p-NP concentration estimated by reference to ap-NP standard curve.
Specific alkaline phosphatase activities were calculated by
standardizing AP values per unit protein/hr. The protein contentof the cell layers was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay,which was based on the Bradford dye-binding procedure.
7cAMP assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 104cells/cm2and incubated at
33°Cuntilconfluent.Cellswerethenincubatedat39°Cfor48hr,
after which the cells were removed from tissue culture flasks bytrypsinization and resuspended in basal medium without serum,containing isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) at a concentration of10
24mol/L, and at a cell density of 2.5 3106cells/mL. After 2
hr, 200 mL of the suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes
andincubatedfor20mineitherwithhumanparathyroidhormone
(PTH) (1-34) at doses of 1027and 1028mol/L, or with PGE2at
doses of 1027or 1028mol/L, or with forskolin at a dose of 1023
mol/L. Following incubation, the cells were boiled for 5 min,centrifuged, and resuspended in 200 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100.
Samples were then frozen/thawed twice and sonicated. cAMPwas measured in 20 mL samples using Amersham’s enzyme
labeled cAMP immunoassay (EIA) kit.
Stimulation of Differentiation Into an Adipocyte-like Phenotype
Cells were seeded at 10
4cells/cm2and cultured in basal medium
at the permissive temperature until approximately 60% conflu-
ent. The medium was then replaced with basal medium contain-ing 10% adult rabbit serum, in place of FCS, a known inducer ofadipocytic differentiation in stromal cell cultures.
33The cells
were then incubated at 39°C for periods of up to 14 days.
Identification of Lipid Accumulation
Following culture, the cells were washed twice with PBS and
then fixed with 10% (v/v) buffered formaldehyde in saline. Cellswere stained for lipids using the Oil-red-O method.

Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
hOP 7 cells were seeded in flasks at 10,000 cells per cm2and
culturedatthepermissivetemperatureuntilconfluent.Cellswere
then incubated at 39°C, either for 7 days in basal medium, or for7 or 14 days in basal medium, where 10% NRS was substitutedfortheFCS.MediawasremovedandthecellswashedtwicewithPBS, and TRIzol reagent added (1 mL per 10 cm
2) and RNA
extracted as recommended by the manufacturers. First strandcDNA was synthesized from 5 mg of RNA with 0.2 mgo f
oligo(dT) primer in the presence of dNTP mix (0.5 mmol/L ofeach), by MMLV-RT (100 units) in a final volume of 20 mL.
RNAandprimerwereincubatedtogetherat70°Cfor10minandthen cooled rapidly on ice before adding the other components.The reverse transcription reaction took place at 37°C for 1 hr.Sampleswerethenheattreated(95°C)for5mintoinactivatetheenzyme.

Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mmol/L KCl, and 1.5 mmol/L MgCl
2.
Amplifications were performed in an Autogene II thermal cycler(Grant) for 30 cycles after an initial denaturation at 94°C for 4min. The same amplification cycles were used for all threeprimer pairs: 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2min. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis of 16mL samples in 1.5% agarose gels, and the amplified DNAfragmentswerevisualizedbyethidiumbromidestaining.Primersused for the PCR reactions are listed in Table 1, along with
confirmatory restrictions with appropriate enzymes.9 Bone Vol. 22, No. 1 A. Houghton et al.

Cloning and Sequencing of PCR Products
PCR products were cloned using the Promega pGEM-T vector
system according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 mL
PCR product was ligated with 50 ng pGEM-T vector in thepresence of 3 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase. The ligationreactions were used to transform competent JM109 bacteria thatwere subsequently streaked on LB plates overlayed with ampi-cillin/IPTG/X-Gal solution, and incubated at 37°C overnight.White bacterial colonies were picked and grown overnight inL-broth containing ampicillin. Plasmid was prepared from theovernightcultures,usingthePromegaWizardplusSVminiprepspurificationsystemaspermanufacturer’sinstructionsfrom3mLof the culture.
0.5mgofplasmidDNAwasrestrictedwith20USal1and20
U Nco 1 in Promega buffer D for 2 hrs prior to agarose gelelectrophoresis to confirm the presence of plasmid insert. Cloneswith inserts of the appropriate size were then grown overnight inLB broth containing ampicillin. Plasmid stocks prepared fromthe overnight incubations were autosequenced using a Licor4000L near-infrared fluorescence autosequencer.
Southern Blot Analysis
Southern blotting and probing was performed essentially as
described previously.
34In short, genomic DNA derived from
T-antigen negative NIH3T3 cells, from hOP 7 cells both beforeand after differentiation to either osteoblasts or adipocytes, andfrom an alternate ts-SV40 transduced cell line, 921203-6,
20was
restricted overnight with Eco-R1, electrophoresed for 4 hr at 90mA, and subsequently blotted onto hybond-N nylon. Completedigestion of the genomic DNA by Eco-R1 was confirmed byethidium bromide staining of the gel prior to blotting. Blots werethenhybridizedwitharadiolabeledSV40-TDNAplasmidprobe,ptsAU19, prepared using the RadPrimer radiolabeling system asper manufacturer’s instructions.
Results
GeneralRetroviral transduction of primary human bone marrow stromal
cells with a vector comprising the ts-SV40-T(A58) oncogeneunder the control of the murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derivedlong terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and neo
runder the control
oftheSV40earlypromoterproducedsustainedcellreplicationat33°C, and conferred geneticin resistance to a series of bone cellpopulationsderivedfromdifferentsources.Resultsfromasingleimmortalized clone (hOP 7), selected for its low alkaline phos-phatase activity, are presented here. Results from other cloneswill also be referred to where appropriate to identify similaritiesand differences.Southern Blot Analysis
The monoclonality of the hOP 7 cell line was confirmed by
Southern blot analysis, which demonstrated an identical bandingpattern for genomically incorporated SV40-T in undifferentiatedanddifferentiated(osteoblasticoradipocytic)hOP7cellcultures(seeFigure 1).
As is always the case for retroviral transduction, multiple
copies of the provirus are incorporated randomly throughout thegenome of the transduced cell.
38Also, the genomically incorpo-
rated provirus has no extraneous plasmid vector sequences out-side the long terminal repeat regions (LTR) at each end of theproviralDNA.InthecaseofhOP7,theintegratedproviralDNAhasnoEco-R1 restriction enzyme recognition sequences.
38
Therefore,cuttinghOP7genomicDNAwithEco-R1willrestrictthe host’s (hOP 7 cell) DNA only. Because multiple copies ofproviral DNA are inserted randomly in the hOP 7 genome, eachproviral insertion will reside within a piece of host DNA whoselength, after cutting with Eco-R1, will depend on how far thehost’s Eco-R1 sites are from the proviral DNA. Therefore, ifEco-R1 restricted hOP 7 DNA is electrophoresed, Southernblotted, and probed for SV40-T sequences, the banding patternseen will represent a composite of all the individual proviralDNA insertions within the hOP 7 genome. It is also clear that,because of random insertion of the provirus, the compositepattern will be unique for each clone of cells derived from asingle cell.

Furthermore,polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting identi-fied the ts-SV40-T antigen in these cells (Figure 2b), without aneed for antigen precipitation and selection prior to blotting. InFigure 2b, lane 1 discloses a clear single band for hOP 7 cells ofthe same M
r,;90 kDa,26as that in the ts-SV40-T positive
control cell line, PA317-cmv-ts-T (lane 2). As expected, no Tantigen was present in the negative control cell line, NIH3T3(lane 3).
Cell Proliferation
At all three seeding densities, there was a steady increase in cell
number at the permissive temperature (33°C) with the highestgrowth rate seen with cells plated at 10,000 cells/cm

Cells from the original clone have undergone more than 27
passages, representing over 100 population doublings that are inexcess of 10
30cells. Cell crisis has not been identified in hOP 7
cells, but crisis is not a necessary prerequisite to immortaliza-tion.
2,5,37We have chosen 100 population doublings, arbitrarily,
to exemplify immortalization as there is no set standard cellreplication number to depict immortalization.
30,36,37All experi-mental data presented are from hOP 7 cells that have undergonebetween 55–60 population doublings.
Expression of Bone Cell Proteins
TheimmortalizedcelllinehOP7wasexaminedforbothalkaline
phosphatase (AP) activity and osteocalcin protein expression, inorder to determine whether the cells constitutively or induciblyexpressed these two proteins, which are characteristic of theosteoblast phenotype.
At 33°C, AP activity was demonstrable ( Figure 4). When

27mol/L dexamethasone for 7
days induced a significant increase in AP activity to 0.848 60.21
mmol p-NP/mg protein/hr at 33°C, and to 7.441 61.97 mmol

Figure 1. Genomic DNA was prepared from hOP 7 cells prior to and
after their differentiation to either an osteoblastic or adipocytic pheno-
type. Genomic DNA was also prepared from a cell line, 921203-620,39
that had been immortalized by transduction with the same retroviralconstruct, and from NIH3T3 cells that had not been retrovirally trans-duced. The DNA was restricted with Eco-R1, electrophoresed in 0.7%agarose for 3 hr at 90 mA and blotted onto hybond-N nylon. Blots werethen incubated with radiolabeled SV40-T probe to identify the genomicintegrations of the ts-SV40-T containing retroviral vector. Lanes 1-5represent: NIH3T3 cell DNA, hOP 7 cell DNA from undifferentiatedcells, hOP 7 cell DNA from osteoblastic differentiated cells, hOP 7 cellDNA from adipocytic differentiated cells, and 921203-6 cell DNA,respectively.ThebandingpatternforhOP7cellsisshowntobeidentical(lanes 2–4) irrespective of the state of differentiation, and this is con-firmedbydensitometricscanningofeachsample(a,b,andcrepresentingscans of clones 4, 3, and 2, respectively). Hence, the possibility that thetwo phenotypes (adipocytes and osteoblasts) relate to two separate cellpopulationswithinthehOP7cloneisnegatedbythisdemonstration—cf.clone 921203-6 in lane 5.

As expected the ts-SV40-T antigen is localized to the nucleus of thecells. No specific fluorescence was identifiable when hOP 7 cells wereincubated with an irrelevant mouse IgG (against human IgM) as theprimary antibody.

Osteocalcin was not detected in media conditioned by hOP 7
cells cultured at 39°C in basal medium for up to 3 weeks.However, at 39°C, and in the presence of 1,25 (OH)
2vitamin D3
and vitamin K, osteocalcin was detected after 8 days of culture(Figure5).Theosteocalcinproductioninresponseto1,25(OH)

vitamin D3was dose dependent (0.41 60.17 ng of osteocalcin
per 104cells at 10211mol/L, increasing to 4.37 60.55 ng of
osteocalcin per 104cells at 1027mol/L,p,0.01 and 0.001,
respectively, compared to control). As expected, exposure todexamethasone alone did not lead to the synthesis of measurablequantities of osteocalcin.
When normalized to ng/mg cell protein/48 hr, the mean
osteocalcin levels expressed by hOP 7 cells in response to thelowest 1,25 (OH)
2vitamin D3concentration, 10211mol/L, was
49.6 ng osteocalcin/mg cell protein/48 hr. This is similar to thebasallevelsexpressedbyhumanmarrowstromalcellsinprimaryculture, ;50 ng osteocalcin/mg cell protein/72 hr.

Stimulation of cAMP Synthesis
hOP 7 cells were treated with either forskolin, PGE2,o rP T H
(1–34) to determine if these known bone agonists would induce
an elevation in hOP 7 cAMP levels. All three agonists had astimulatoryeffectoncAMPlevelsinhOP7cells( Figure6).The
best response, as expected, was seen with forskolin at a dose of10
23mol/L, which increased basal levels over two fold. Both

Mineralization of the Extracellular Matrix
After 28 days of culture in the presence of b-glycerophosphate,
and with or without 1027mol/L dexamethasone, hOP 7 cells
were stained using the von Kossa method to demonstrate min-
eralization of the extracellular matrix. Both the treated anduntreated cultures became mineralized, although by far thegreater amount of deposition was seen in the dexamethasone-treated cultures ( Figure 7).
Stimulation of Differentiation to an Adipocyte-like Phenotype
In hOP 7 cells cultured for 7 days in the presence of media
containing FCS at 39°C, no lipid could be detected by histolog-

ical staining with Oil-red-O ( Figure 8b). However, when treated
with NRS, Oil-red-O positive staining could be observed after
3 days of treatment. Oil-red-O staining after 7 days of NRStreatment, which is shown in Figure 8a, could not be inhibitedby the addition of 10
27mol/L 17 b-estradiol to the culture
medium. Quantification of the adipogenic response of hOP 7cells to rabbit serum is shown in Figure 8d, where 89.9 6
4.1% (x6SD) of cells are positive for Oil-red-O staining
when incubated in culture medium containing 10% normalrabbit serum for 7 days with a half-maximal (49.12 613.8%,
x6SD)adipogenicresponse,achievedwith3%normalrabbit
serum. In contrast, ts-SV40-T immortalized osteoblast-likecells derived from explants of adult human trabecular bonechips could not be induced to differentiate down an adipocyticpathway with normal rabbit serum. In addition, we havegenerated articular chondrocyte and neural cell lines by ret-roviral transduction of ts-SV40-T
20,39which also could not be
induced to accumulate lipid (data not shown). Therefore, theaccumulation of lipid is not a general property of ts-SV40-Ttransduced cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperatureand in the presence of rabbit serum.
Incubation of the immortalized stromal cells with NRS for
1 week at 39°C also induced the expression of mRNA forlipoprotein lipase, an early marker of the adipocytic lineage(Figure 9 a). Furthermore, type a1(I) procollagen mRNA
expression, a marker of the osteoblastic cell lineage, could notbe detected by rt-PCR after incubation with 10% normalrabbitserumfor7days(Figure9b).MessengerRNAforalatestage adipocyte specific marker glycerol 3-phosphate dehy-drogenase (G3PDH) could be identified after 14 days ofincubation with 10% NRS (Figure 9c). b
2-microglobulin
mRNA expression, as determined by rt-PCR, was unaffectedby treatment with 10% NRS (Figure 9d). The type a1(I)
procollagen, lipoprotein lipase, and glycerol 3-phosphate de-hydrogenase sequences identified by rt-PCR were confirmedby cloning and sequencing.Discussion
Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of adult
human marrow stromal cells, with ts-SV40-T, induces cell rep-lication for at least 100 population doublings when cells areincubatedattheoncogene’spermissivetemperature.Thisfindingis supported by previous studies in which a cell line withosteoblast characteristics was derived from human fetal tissueusing a similar approach.
17
The use of a modulatable oncogene2,31to induce the
sustained replication of cells has a distinct advantage. Activeoncogene expression can be negated once large homogeneouscell populations have been produced. The difficulties in in-terpreting results from cell studies where the oncogenic driveis maintained is therefore avoided.
23Moreover, we have
shown that hOP 7 is bipotential in that it has also the capacityto express functional characteristics of marrow adipocytes.The multipotentiality of hOP 7 appears to be restricted toosteoblastic or adipogenic differentiation since incubationwith differentiating agents such as retinoic acid or IBMXfailed to induce expression of alternative mesenchymal phe-notypes (e.g., myoblast or chondroblast) (data not shown).Because we have produced 48 clones from fetal and adulthuman skeletal tissue sources, with 4 having this property(data not shown), we believe the bipotential nature of hOP 7

is unlikely to be an artifact of cell immortalization and/or
culture conditions, but represents an inherent cell lineage traitof the human marrow stromal cell differentiation process.
Experimental evidence to support a close cell lineage rela-
tionship between adipocytes and osteoblasts derived from bonemarrow has come from both animal and human studies. Bennettet al.

marrow cultures could form osteogenic tissue when grown indiffusion chambers, in vivo. Furthermore, from the results ofstudies of cultured rat marrow stromal tissue, Beresford et al.

proposed an inverse relationship between the differentiation ofadipocytic and osteogenic cells. Also, recent work by Rickard etal.
33showed that purified populations of human marrow stromal
cells have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts as well asinto adipocytes.
Furthermore, direct evidence for the existence of a com-
mon progenitor from which both adipocytes and osteoblastsare derived comes from a study that shows that the murinestromal cell lines BMS2
19and1/12.4,20both of which
spontaneously undergo adipogenesis in the presence of fetalbovine serum, could express some markers of the osteogeniclineage when in a state of preadipocyte or adipocyte differ-entiation.
12However, the expression of osteogenic markers in
the absence of adipogenesis was not observed. Because thesecell lines are transformed, doubt must remain as to whetherthey represent truly bipotential adipocytic/osteoblastic mousemarrow stromal cells.
We have found that incubation of human marrow stromal
cell clone hOP 7 with NRS induces its differentiation down anadipocyticroutedespiteexpressionofcharacteristicsnormallyassociated with osteoblast precursors. Interestingly, pretreat-ment of NRS with activated charcoal removes the ability ofthe NRS to induce adipocytic differentiation in hOP 7 cells, asdoes the removal of components greater than 100 kDa (datanot shown). This suggests the possible presence in rabbitserum of a small molecular weight agent(s) capable of driving
