Due to the increasing number of osteoporotic fractures ofhip, spine, and wrist there is a growing need for methods totrack down the subjects with inferior bone structure and tomonitor the effects of therapeutic measures. This study aimsat a noninvasive diagnostic tool, deriving architectural prop-ertiesoftrabecularbonefrominvivomeasurementsonplaneradiographic films. Pelvic radiographs of the nonfracturedhips of 81 patients with hip fractures and of the right hips of74 controls were studied. The regions of interest, 2 32c m
2,
located in the femoral neck, were sampled and digitized witha video camera connected to an image analysis system. Sev-eral geometrical and directional measurements were made.The measurements were evaluated by statistical comparisonwith fracture risk, gender, and Singh index. By discriminantanalysis, type of fracture, as well as gender and Singh indexcouldbepredictedcorrectlyfor58%ofthesubjects,whereasguessing would be correct in only 8%. It was found that thegeometrical parameters discriminate between hips of con-trols and patients. With respect to the directional measure-ments associations were found with gender and Singh index.Although the new parameters assess fracture risk less accu-rately than bone density measurements, some parameterssuggest by their behavior that they are relevant with respectto femoral bone architecture and its mechanical behavior.Although interpretation of the measurements in histologicalconcepts requires methods that have been reported in liter-ature only recently, it is concluded that digital analysis of theradiographic trabecular pattern is an interesting option toincreasethediagnosticyieldofplanefilmradiographsandtostudy the structure of bone in vivo.

Introduction
Theneedforinvivoscreeningmethodsofbonestructurethatcan
be applied on a large scale is increasing. The number of osteo-porotic fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist is increasingthroughout the western world, causing great expense, suffering,and mortality.
16Identifying subjects at risk for fractures wouldhelp target preventive measures to those who have the greatest
risk. Moreover, imaging modalities monitoring bone structureenhance the development of therapeutic strategies.
Oneofthemajorproblemsinresearchofbonestructureisthe
difficulty of access to the interior, which is enclosed by layers ofhard cortical bone and vulnerable soft tissues. The exclusion ofthe bone interior from direct observation is an operational limi-tation to all research. In spite of this limitation, several methodshavebeendevelopedtoobtainimagesfromtheinteriorofbones.Some of the methods, such as autopsy and biopsy, are invasiveand destructive, and neither suitable for longitudinal studies norfor studying large numbers of subjects for tracking those withincreased risk of fractures. Noninvasive methods scan the bonewith ultrasound, radiowaves (MRI), or X-rays. However, atpresent, the imaging methods using ultrasonic waves or radiowaves do not resolve details in the internal bone architecturedown to the typical trabecular plate thickness of 0.1 mm.
Various techniques, such as computed tomography (CT),
pantomography, and plane-film radiography, use X-rays to de-pict parts of the skeleton. During the past decade special CTdevices have been developed with sufficient resolution to createdetailed images of the internal bone structure (0.1 and 0.2mm).
17,27A major advantage of the CT-imaging technique is the
production of true three-dimensional data, offering complete
access to the structures to be analyzed. In planning the shape andsite of implants and in monitoring osseointegration after surgicalprocedures, CT systems provide valuable information. However,restraints are imposed on the applicability of CT systems by thehigh radiation dose administered to the subjects.
Plane-film radiography uses a radiation dose that is a small
fractionofthedoseneededtoproduceaCTimage.Thearchitectureof bone is projected on the plane film yielding much informationwith a low radiation dose; however, the third dimension is lost byradiographic projection, leading to ambiguities when interpretingthe radiographic film in spatial terms. Nevertheless, plane-filmradiography is a noninvasive technique, inexpensive, and widelyused for obtaining information about bone structure in vivo, forexample, in orthopedic and dental radiography. Taking into consid-eration various possibilities of depicting the internal bone structure,each with specific limitations, it is concluded that, at the presentstate of the art, plane-film radiography is the most acceptablemethod for population screening.
The general aim of the research underlying this report is to
increase the diagnostic yield of radiographs with respect to bonearchitecture by performing automated measurements of the ra-diographic trabecular bone pattern. The lack of detailed modelsdescribing the structure of cancellous bone severely limits thepossibilities of predicting the quality of the radiographic trabec-

ular pattern and its relation to clinical indicators. A priori, it is
not known how many or which parameters are necessary tocharacterizetheradiographictrabecularpattern.Therefore,itwasdecided to derive measurements from the trabecular pattern andto evaluate their clinical relevance by statistical comparison withclinical indicators. In this study, several geometrical and direc-tional measures on pelvic radiographs are evaluated.
Subjects
From September 1978 to December 1979 a survey was con-
ducted in the Departments of Orthopaedics and Surgery, OnzeLieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam. Both patients with cervicalfracturesaswellaspatientswithintertrochantericfracturesofthehip were included in the study. Patients varied from active,middle-aged people to debilitated inhabitants of nursing homes.Control subjects were healthy volunteers living independently inapartment housing for the elderly. The age of the subjects was76610 years. The subjects participated in a study on metabolic
causes and prevention of femoral neck fractures, as described byLips,
20Lips et al.,21Uitewaal et al.,31and Van der Wiel et al.32
Materials
The radiological examinations of patients and control subjects
were performed in the Department of Radiology of the hospital.Patients were usually examined 10–14 days after the operation,when they were partially mobile. An anteroposterior radiographwas made of one hip in 15° internal rotation. The films depictedthe nonfractured hips of 81 patients and the right hips of 74controls.
The trabecular pattern of the hips was graded from 6 to 1 by
an observer, using the method of Singh et al.
29:
Grade 6: All normal groups of trabeculae visible as in Figure 1.
Grade 5: The principal groups are more prominent.Grade 4: Complete resorption of the secondary compressive
group.
Grade 3: The tensile group is discontinuous.Grade 2: Only the principal compressive group is prominent.Grade 1: Neither group is prominent.The Singh index was lower for the patients than for the
control subjects (3.9 60.7 vs. 4.6 60.5).
20,21The lowest score
for the Singh index, associated with severe osteoporosis, was notencountered. Grades 6 and 5 and grades 3 and 2 were combinedto facilitate multivariate analysis; grades 6 and 5 are found in anormal population; grade 4 is ambiguous; and grades 3, 2, and 1represent subsequent stages of osteoporosis, according to Singhet al.

Preprocessing
The region of interest on radiographs of a hip was an area of
232cm2locatedbetweenthetrochantersofthefemoralneck
(Figure 2 ) with left and right sides of the region of interest
parallel with the axial direction (90°). Radiographs showingthe right hip were reversed before sampling to conform theirorientation to radiographs of the left side. The radiographswere put on a dazzle-light and the regions of interest weresampled with a video camera, connected to an image analysissystem. With automatic procedures, the video signal wasdigitized ( Figure 3 A), filtered (Figure 3B, C), and simplified
to images composed of black-and-white regions (Figure 3D),as described by Geraets et al.,
12Geraets and Van der Stelt,9
and Geraets.8The filtering operation suppresses variations in
background due to varying thickness of the cortical layers bysubtracting a blurred version of the image (Figure 3B) fromthe original one (Figure 3A); a related filtering method hasbeen described by Andresen et al.

The images were then analyzed in two different ways: first,
ten features describing the geometry of the trabecular patternwere quantified, and then orientation of the pattern was quanti-fied by directional measurements along 12 directions, as de-scribed by Geraets,
8Korstjens et al.,19and Geraets et al.11
Analysis of Geometry
The simplified version of the trabecular pattern (Figure 3D)
consists of black and white pixels. When considering the bor-derlines between pixels of opposite colors it is seen that thetrabecular pattern is partitioned into black and white regions,some containing only few pixels, whereas others cover a sub-stantial part of the region of interest. The following measure-ments were performed on the regions:
1. Area of the white regions (WAREA).
2. Circumference of the white regions (WCIRC).3. Number of black regions (BLAKS).4. Number of white regions (WITES).
Erosion of the white regions yielded the connective skeleton of
the white regions (Figure 3E), quantified by:5. Length of the skeleton (WAXIS).
6. Number of branch points in the skeleton (WFORK).7. Number of end points in the skeleton (WENDS).
Analogously, erosion of the black regions yielded the connective
skeleton of the black regions (Figure 3F), quantified by:
8. Length of the skeleton (BAXIS).
9. Number of branch points in the skeleton (BFORK).
10. Number of endpoints in the skeleton (BENDS).
It is convenient to quantify features expressing length or area, in
units of pixels, postponing the conversion of the features intomillimeters or square millimeters until required.
Related measurements, applied on sections of the iliac crest,
were described by Garrahan et al.
7and Compston et al.3
Analysis of Orientation
The binary trabecular pattern (Figure 3D) was also used to
measure orientation. A grid was defined containing 180 par-allel lines, each with 180 pixels. The center of the gridcoincided with the center of the image (256 3256 pixels).
The grid rotated round the center in 12 subsequent steps ofwhich 4 are shown in Figure 4 . To measure the orientation of
the image in a particular direction, the grid was rotated so thatits lines parallel the direction. Then, at each line of themeasuring grid, the fraction of white pixels was calculated,resulting in 180 fractions between 0.0 and 1.0. The standarddeviation (SD) of these fractions expresses the orientation ofthe image along the given direction: If the pattern is notoriented along the direction, then the lines in the measuringgrid contain roughly the same fraction of white pixels, result-ing in a small SD (minimum value 0.0). But, if the pattern isoriented along the given direction, then some lines in the gridcontain predominantly white pixels, whereas other lines con-tain mainly black pixels, causing higher values of SD (max-imum value 0.5). Finally, the measurements with the rotatinggrid were collected in a table (for further calculations) anddisplayedinadiagramasindicatedinthemiddleleftofFigure4. Several examples are given in Figure 5 .
Arelatedmethodofanalyzingorientation,appliedonsections
of the patella, was described by Cheal et al.

Reproducibility
The process of image analysis is affected by noise introduced
at various stages of the imaging system. To estimate the effectof variations in positioning the hip with respect to the X-raydevice, experiments with repeated exposures of the samesubject would be needed. However, such experiments werenot justified; instead, variations in positioning the hip withrespect to the X-ray device were assumed to be distributedrandomly over the subjects and were not taken into furtherconsideration.
To estimate the reproducibility of the measurements, 75
radiographs from the control group were ten times positionedunder the camera, digitized and processed. The reliability of themeasurements was tested by Cronbach’s a; that is, the estimated
ratio between true variance and total variance. Cronbach’s a
varies with the number of observations. When more measure-ments are taken, reliability increases. The Spearman–Brownformula was used to recalculate Cronbach’s afor twofold mea-
surements ( Table 1). The measurement error, calculated as
1003(12a), estimates the percentage of total variance attrib-
uted to noise.

February 1998:165–173 Radiographic trabecular pattern of hips
and variations in the video part of the image analysis system
were partially suppressed by twofold sampling and analysis ofthe radiographs. Subsequent statistical tests combined the twosets of measurements by averaging.
Statistics
Statistical evaluation of the data of subjects and measurements
on the radiographs concentrated on geometry and orientation ofthe hip in relation to fracture risk, fracture type (intertrochantericor cervical), gender, and Singh index.Discriminant analysis and canonical correlations were per-
formed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
30to
detectmultivariaterelations.Indiscriminantanalysis,thepredic-tive value of the trabecular pattern follows from the percentageof individuals correctly identified ( Table 2).
Thedescriptivestatistics(mean 6SD)werecalculatedwithin
the subgroups of Tables 3, and4. Student’s t-test was used to
compare patients with controls (columns A, B, and C), womenwith men (column D), and osteoporotics with normals (columnE).p,0.05 was considered significant; the critical value for
Student’s t-test in Tables 3 and 4 is 2.0.

Results
Themeasurementerror(Table1)wasfoundtovaryconsiderably
overthegeometricfeatures.Therelativeerrorof6%forWCIRCis quite favorable, whereas the relative error of 28% in themeasurements of WAREA can still be considered acceptable.Thedirectionalmeasurementswerefoundtobelessreproduciblethan the geometric features, with relative errors varying from21% for LFD (90°) to 52% for LFD (15°).
155 radiographs of the hip were sampled and processed twice
and the measurements were averaged. The relation of the trabec-ularpatternofthehipwiththeriskoffracture,gender,andSinghindex was evaluated with discriminant analysis (Table 2); pre-dictions were made, on basis of the radiographic trabecularpattern, whether the corresponding subject was a control subject
or a patient with trochanteric or cervical fracture, whether thesubject was male or female, and the Singh index was predicted(normal 56,5;conspicuous 54;osteoporotic 53,2,1).In58%
of cases, fracture risk, gender, and Singh index were predictedcorrectly; in 77% of cases, at least two of the three factors wereclassified correctly. It was demonstrated that the trabecularpattern of the hip had a multivariate relation with fracture risk(p,0.001), gender ( p50.01), and Singh index ( p50.03).
When comparing the hips of the patients with the hips of the
controls (Tables 3 and 4 columns A, B, and C) it was found thatthe trabecular pattern of the hips in patients was quite differentfrom controls. It is remarkable that all geometrical features

scored less in patients than in controls (except for a nonsignifi-
cantdifferenceforWAREA).Thissuggeststhattheradiographictrabecular pattern of patients was less detailed in several ways.The circumference of the white regions was smaller in patientsthan in controls ( t522.8). Considering the ratio area/circum-
ference (WAREA/WCIRC) as a measure of the width of thewhite regions it was found that the white regions were fewer butwider in patients than in controls ( t512.5). Similarly, it was
found that patients displayed fewer but wider black regions thancontrols ( t513.8).Whencomparingthetwofracturegroupsitwasfoundthatthe
trochanteric patient group was more distinguished from thecontrolgroup(Table3,columnB)thanthecervicalpatientgroup(Table 3, column C). Apparently, the region of interest, locatedbetween the trochanters, was more appropriate for detecting riskof trochanteric fractures than for detecting risk of cervical frac-tures. Student’s t-test yielded no significant differences between
the intertrochanteric and the cervical group; however, the cervi-cal fracture group was found to be more homogeneous.
When comparing the hips of women and men (Tables 3 and
4, column D), it was found that only the directional indices(along 75° and 90°) discriminate women from men. Whenconfinedtocontrols,comparisonofmenandwomengavesimilarresults; however, within the group of patients, the gender differ-ences were not significant.
When comparing the trabecular pattern of the hips with high
and low Singh index (Tables 3 and 4, column E), it was foundthat osteoporotic subjects associated with higher values ofWITES and with higher values of the line fraction deviation(LFD) index along 15°, 45°, 60°, and 75°.Table1. Measurementerrorfortwofoldmeasurementsofgeometricand

Radiographic trabecular pattern of hips February 1998:165–173
Discussion
Withrespecttopredictionofhipfractures,anexcellentstudywas
done by Glu ¨er et al.,13demonstrating that simple measurements
on pelvic radiographs of white women enable prediction of hipfractures just as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry(DXA) bone density measurements of the hip; the area underROC curve, indicating predictive power, amounted 0.81 and0.80, respectively. The visibility of the principal tensile groupgraded by a radiologist was found to be a variable of morepredictive power than the Singh index, cortical thickness of thefemoral shaft, and other variables. By combining measurementsfrom the pelvic radiographs with femoral neck density and age,the area under the ROC curve rose to 0.85 (maximum 1.0).Considering that the risk of hip fracture is associated not onlywith bone mass and bone structure, but also with factors thatcannot be predicted, it is questionable how much more thepredictive power can be increased by elaborate measurements onpelvicradiographs.Nevertheless,adeeperunderstandingofbonearchitecture and its mechanical behavior is necessary for devel-opmentofprophylacticandtherapeuticmodalities,suchasdrugsor implants. The grading of the principal tensile group by aradiologist’s subjective judgment, although effective, demon-strates the lack of well-defined concepts in measuring the radio-graphic trabecular pattern and bone architecture in general.Structural parameters need to be invented and tested to evaluatetheir relevance. Therefore, the results presented in Tables 3 and4 are encouraging further research rather than for enabling directclinical applications.
The finding that the trabecular pattern of patients is less
detailed compared with controls (Table 3, column A) might havebeen explained by Siffert,
28who described that, during the early
stages of bone atrophy, the fine trabeculae are the first that aresubject to thinning, discontinuity, and absorption, making thetrabecular pattern coarse. In the present study, the lower valuesof the LFD index along 45°–75° in osteoporotic subjects (Table4, column E) was consistent with the early loss of the secondarycompressive group according to the model of Singh. The findingthat the trabecular pattern of the hips of patients was orientedmore along 75° (Table 4, column A) may have been caused byresorption of principal tensile trabeculae (105°–165°), leavingthe secondary compressive trabeculae (15°–75°) more promi-nent; however, according to the grading system of Singh, thesecondary compressive trabeculae are resorbed sooner than theprincipal tensile trabeculae. Because low values of Singh indexare associated with osteoporotic states it might be expected thatthe low Singh index group should be more similar to the patientgroup than to the control group; however, this is contradicted bythehighvaluesofWITESintheosteoporoticgroup(249vs.226,t512.2 in Table 3, column E). According to Figure 1, the
region of interest, located between the trochanters, is traversedby the projections of the principal tensile and the secondarycompressive trabeculae, thus, we expected increased values ofthe LFD index along 135° and 45°; however, in most radio-graphs, the maximum value of the LFD index was found alongthe axial direction (90°) (see Table 1 and Figures 6 ,7, and8).
This discrepancy is probably due to an oversimplified represen-tation of the radiographic trabecular pattern of hips in Figure 1,combined with a region of interest that was small in comparisonto the femur.
The method of Singh to establish diagnosis and severity of
osteoporosis is controversial; Khairi et al.
18found bone mineral
content of the radius more useful in predicting the risk ofsubsequent fractures, whereas Dequeker et al.
6found the method
of value in screening subjects liable to fractures of the femoralneck; however, when the Singh index was scored on radiographsof both hips, good agreement was found between the left and
right hips by Cooper et al.
4This confirms our working hypoth-
esis that, in general, the two hips of a subject are similar (nearlymirror symmetry). This seems reasonable, because, in general,both hips are subject to the same circumstances. From thestatisticalpointofview,thecorrelationoftrabecularpatternwiththe Singh index is not remarkable because it may be caused byconfounding with fracture risk. However, because the Singhindex focuses on an area much larger than the present region ofinterest,itisofinterestthatthetrabecularstructureofthefemoralhead is also contained, to some extent, in a region of 2 32c m
2.
With respect to important concepts of cancellous structures,

dimensional bone samples as the maximum number of branches
thatcanbebrokenbeforethestructureisseparatedintotwoparts.In this study, connectedness of the radiographic trabecular pat-tern is depicted in Figure 3E and F. For the time being, connect-edness is evaluated by parameters WAXIS, WENDS, andWFORK and BAXIS, BENDS, and BFORK. In this study, theriskoffractureswasfoundtobeassociatedmostwithparametersWFORK and BENDS. It seems improbable that the results canbe explained by changes in the interior structure of the hipsduring the period of 10–14 days of immobilization before radio-graphic investigation. Although the new parameters assess frac-ture risk less accurately than the parameters measured by Glu ¨er
et al.,
13they may be of interest with respect to local bone
structure. Therefore, further research on the histological inter-pretation of these measurements seems justified.
Under the age of 50 years, hip fractures are infrequent. After
the age of 50, the incidence rises steeply, especially for women.The different strength of male and female hips was partiallyexplained by Martin and Atkinson,
23who reported that the
material strength of bone from the femoral shaft decreases withageequallyinmalesandfemales,butonlyinmalesthisdecreaseis compensated by an increasing cross-sectional moment ofinertia of the femoral shaft. Because our method extracts localdifferences in gray values, rather than absolute gray values, it isexpected that changes in the internal and external diameters ofthe femoral shaft do not affect the measurements. Because hipfractures are more common in females than in males it might beexpectedthatfemalesaresimilartopatients(andmalessimilartocontrols); thus, females would have higher values for LFD (75°)than males. However, this proved not to be the case (0.112 vs.0.124,t522.9inTable4,columnD).Presumably,thedifferent
orientation reflects the sexual dimorphism of humanoid pelvisand hip, associated with different mechanical loading patterns.
From the geometrical parameters described in this work,
WAREAismostsimpletounderstand,atleastintechnicalterms.WAREAequalsthesurfaceofthewhiteregions(seeFigure3D),which is a simple measure, offered by virtually any imaginganalysis system. If the images had originated from bone biopsyslices, then white areas could be identified with bone.
5,22How-
ever, when radiographs are being analyzed, then WAREA canbehave in unexpected ways. For example, despite loss of bone
mineral around menopause in virtually all parts of the skeleton,it has been shown, in the radius of perimenopausal women, thatWAREA increases over time.
8–10In this study, WAREA did not
associate with fracture risk, neither with gender nor with Singhindex. Relations between the radiographic trabecular pattern andbiomechanical characteristics of vertebral sections have beenreported by Korstjens et al.
19In their study, the geometric
parameter WITES explained about 50% of the variance in com-pressive strength: lower values of WITES were found for verte-bral sections with higher stress resistance. This seems contradic-torytoourfindingoflowervaluesofWITESforfracturepatientsthan for controls (224 vs. 241, t522.3 in Table 3 column A);
however, vertebrae and thigh bones may behave differently. Inthis study, the geometrical and directional measurements on theradiographs are difficult to explain in histological terms or inspatial terms because of the lack of spatial data such as serialbone slices or high-resolution CT scans. The method recentlydescribed by Odgaard et al.
24and Van Rietbergen et al.26
resolved a bone specimen of 7 3737m m3into 176 31763
248 voxels. With help of this technique the spatial structure ofthe bone sample can be studied intensively and various radio-graphic projections can be calculated. Moreover, various me-chanical tests, which are destructive when applied on a real bonespecimen, can be simulated in the virtual specimen. Thus, thenew method bridges the gap between the radiographic appear-ance of bone and its mechanical properties, enabling directcomparison of radiographic features with spatial features ofbone. Although applicable in vitro only, such methods arenecessary to gain more understanding of the present results.
The method to measure orientation is applicable to a variety
ofimagescontainingelongatedstructures.Multiplesamplingandadjustment of the method to multiple gray-level images can beused to improve the reproducibility of measurements. The anal-ysis can be performed on parts of the image as well (see Cheal etal.
2). Also, the method for measuring orientation can be ex-
panded from the two-dimensional plane to three-dimensionalspace, resulting in three-dimensional polar plots as described byGoldstein et al.
14Considering that a rather small region of
interest of 4 cm2on pelvic radiographs relates to fracture risk,
fracturetype,andgender,itcanbeconcludedthatdigitalanalysisof the radiographic trabecular pattern offers a worthwhile optionfor increasing the diagnostic yield of plane-film radiographs andfor studying the structure of bone in vivo.
