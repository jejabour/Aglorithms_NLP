mice. Using breast cancer patient plasma (36 patients), we identi ﬁed signi ﬁcantly elevated IL-8 levels in bone
metastasis patients compared with patients lacking bone metastasis (p b0.05), as well as a correlation between
plasma IL-8 and increased bone resorption (p b0.05), as measured by NTx levels. In a total of 22 ER+ and 15

human MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MET breast cancer cell lines secrete two distinct IL-8 isoforms, both of whichwere found to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. However, the more osteolytic MDA-MET-derived full lengthIL-8(1 –77) had signi ﬁcantly higher potency than the non-osteolytic MDA-MB-231-derived IL-8(6 –77), viathe
CXCR1 receptor. MDA-MET breast cancer cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice and 7 days later treateddaily with a neutralizing IL-8 monoclonal antibody. All tumor-injected mice receiving no antibody developedlarge osteolytic bone tumors, whereas 83% of the IL-8 antibody-treated mice had no evidence of tumor at the
end of 28 days and had signi ﬁcantly increased survival. The pro-osteoclastogenic activity of IL-8 in vivo was con-
ﬁrmed when transgenic mice expressing human IL-8 were examined and found to have a profound osteopenic
phenotype, with elevated bone resorption and inherently low bone mass. Collectively, these data suggest that
IL-8 plays an important role in breast cancer osteolysis and that anti-IL-8 therapy may be useful in the treatment
of the skeletal related events associated with breast cancer.

Introduction
Currently, there are approximately 2 million women in the United
States living with breast cancer, and the disease is the second leading
cause of cancer death in women [1]. Bone is a common site for cancer
metastasis, and bone metastases are frequently associated with compli-
cations such as hypercalcemia due to osteolysis, nerve compression, in-
tractable bone pain and pathological fractures [2]. Approximately 80% ofwomen with metastatic breast cancer will have tumors arise in bone
during the course of their disease [3].
The diagnosis of distant metastases mandates systemic rather than
local primary intervention. Although largely incurable, patient manage-
ment decisions regarding metastatic breast cancer suggest that initia-
tion of early and aggressive treatment (both local and/or systemic)may be appropriate in some of these patients. The progression of breast
cancer bone metastases requires the establishment of functional inter-
actions between metastatic breast cancer cells and bone cells [4].
These interactions are presumably mediated by direct cell –cell contact
and/or soluble stimulators that directly or indirectly induce osteoclast
formation and activity [2,4 –6].
In particular, breast cancer metastasis to bone presents unique char-
acteristics which have been successfully targeted in the palliativeBone 61 (2014) 176 –185

setting, primarily by the use of bisphosphonates, which target the
osteolytic activity of the osteoclast [2,5,6] and anti-RANKL therapy
[2,5,7] . However, targeting the osteoclast alone does little to tumor bur-
den in bone and suggests that other treatment modalities should be
considered.
We and others have shown that the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8/
CXCL8) is expressed by primary breast cancers and is able to directlystimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption [8–11].I L - 8i sa l s oa
potent stimulator of the number and invasiveness of circulating tumorcells (CTCs) especially in tumors with enhanced bone tropism
[12 –15]. Collectively, these and other data suggest that IL-8 may play
an important role in breast cancer progression [16]. One report sug-
gested a correlation of serum IL-8 levels with breast cancer metastasis
[17]and recently Singh and colleagues [18]suggested a role for IL-8 in
the regulation of patient-derived breast cancer stem-like cell activity.However, the measurement of circulating IL-8 in breast cancer patients
with and without bone metastasis and its correlation with levels of bone
resorption has not been studied extensively.
Thus, we measured IL-8 in the circulation of breast cancer patients
with and without bone metastasis and performed immunocytochemis-
try on a series of primary human breast cancers, as well as examined
IL-8 function in vivo and in vitro . The data demonstrate that IL-8 is
highly expressed by primary human breast cancers and is signi ﬁcantly
correlated with elevated bone resorption in breast cancer patients.
Tumor-derived systemic IL-8 contributes to increased tumor coloniza-
tion, tumor growth and bone destruction, and these cellular events
can be inhibited by anti-IL-8 therapy.
Materials and methods
Reagents
Tissue culture plastics were supplied by Falcon (Lincoln Park, NJ). All
other analytical grade reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO) or Fisher (Spring ﬁeld, NJ). All tissue culture media and reagents
were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Recombi-nant human RANKL, recombinant murine macrophage colony stimulat-
ing factor (CSF-1), recombinant human IL-8, IL-8(1 –77), and IL-8(6 –77)
and control IgG were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Anti-IL-8 antibodies used in vivo were obtained from R&D Systems.
Patient samples
Archival breast cancer patient plasma was obtained from 36 patients
(18 with and 18 without bone metastasis) for the measurement of IL-8.
Analysis of the archival plasma samples was approved by the University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Pennsylvania State University In-
stitutional Review Boards. The clinical assessment of bone metastasis
was based on patient bone scan, X-ray evidence of bone metastasis,
and elevated blood N-telopeptide (NTx) levels, a clinical marker of
bone resorption [19]. The serum NTx levels of all patients were used
to help discern the presence or absence of bone metastasis. Thewomen ranged in age from 49 to 92 years with a median age of 70 in
the ‘bone metastasis ’group and 67 in the ‘no bone metastasis ’group.
A power analysis was conducted to con ﬁrm that the size of the sample
was suf ﬁcient to provide a statistical power of more than 80%.
In addition, a series of archival formalin-ﬁ xed parafﬁ n embedded
tumor tissue samples from 22 ER+ (expressing 2+ to 3+ positivity
inN50% cells) and 15 ER −i
 nvasive ductal breast carcinomas, irrespec-
tive of grade and stage of disease, were also selected for evaluation. Un-stained sections were immunostained for IL-8 expression (anti-IL-8
antibody, dilution 1:200, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) with appro-
priate positive and negative controls. The intensity of staining for IL-8
was graded on a scale of 0 to 3+ with 0 representing no detectable
staining and 3+ representing the strongest staining. Two independent
observers examined each slide.Cell lines and culture conditions
The MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-231), MDA-MET cell lines and
transfected variants (sense and anti-sense) were maintained inDMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in sterile
culture dishes [9]. Highly bone metastatic MDA-MET cells were derived
from a weakly osteolytic MDA-231 variant by in vivo selection [9]. MDA-
MET cells secrete full length IL-8 and produce osteolytic lesions (100%)within 4 weeks of inoculation in the circulation or tibia of athymic nude
mice [20]and grow effectively in the mammary fat pad [21]compared
with MDA-231 cells that produce little full-length IL-8 [20].
MDA-231-IL8 and MDA-MET-AS cells were generated by stable
transfection of expression vectors (pcDNA3 Invitrogen, Carlsbad,California) expressing full length hIL-8 or anti-sense hIL-8 cDNA as a
HindIII –BamHI fragment by calcium phosphate precipitation. The
pcDNA3/IL-8 sense or antisense (AS) DNA transfected cells weregrown and single clones isolated by limiting dilution in the presence
of the selective marker, G418 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri,
USA). Clones were screened by measuring the amount of secreted
hIL-8 (in sense expressing MDA-231 or the loss of IL-8 in MDA-MET an-
tisense cells) in serum-free 48-h conditioned media. Clones with signif-
icantly increased and decreased IL-8 levels were selected for further
study.
HEK-293 human embryonal kidney cells stably expressing CXCR1 or
CXCR2 (a generous gift from Dr. Ji Ming Wang, NCI Frederick Cancer
Research) were grown as monolayers in growth medium (Dulbecco's
modi ﬁed Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin
(100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)). Cells were grown to
approximately 75% con ﬂuency in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO
2at
37 °C as described [22].
IL-8 ligand binding assay
Ligand binding assays were performed as described [23].B r i e ﬂy,
duplicate aliquots of stably transfected CXCR1 or CXCR2 HEK-293 cells(5 × 10
5–1×1 06cells/200 μl) were re-suspended in binding medium
(RPMI 1640; 10 mg/ml BSA; 25 mM HEPES; 0.05% Na azide) in thepresence of 0.1 ng
125IL-8 (DuPont-NEN, DE) and serial dilutions of un-
labeled IL-8(1 –77 or 6 –77). Following 1 h incubation at room tempera-
ture the cells were centrifuged through 0.8 ml sucrose in PBS and the
radioactivity remaining in the cell pellets was measured in a 1272
CliniGamma gamma counter (Pharmacia, MD).
Intratibial injection of tumor cells, antibody treatment and survival
MDA-MET, MDA-231-IL8 and MDA-MET-AS cells were grown to sub-
conﬂuence. Fresh medium was added 24 h before harvesting for tumor
inoculation. On the day of the injections, cells were harvested with
0.2% EDTA and 0.02% trypsin, washed twice in PBS and resuspended in
PBS at a concentration of 106cells/ml. Four-week-old athymic female
nude mice were used for all tumor inoculations, purchased from TaconicFarms (Taconic, NY) and housed in an approved animal facility with pro-
tocols approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Before injection, the animals were deeply anesthetized with a
1:1:4.6 solution of xylazine:ketamine:PBS (administered i.p. at 0.033-
ml mixture/10-g body weight) as described [20]. The mice were placed
in a prone position and after gently palpating the tibia, the upper end ofthe tibia was identi ﬁed as the site for injection. Approximately
10,000 cells (in 10 μl) were injected into the right tibia of nude mice
using a 50 μl syringe and 28 gauge needle. PBS only was injected in
the left leg as vehicle control. After injection, the mice were placed ona heating pad to recover from anesthesia and then returned to their
cages.
For the experiments using antibody treatments, animals were
randomized into 3 groups: IL-8 antibody group (20 mice), control IgG177 A. Kamalakar et al. / Bone 61 (2014) 176 –185
antibody group (20 mice) and no antibody group (15 mice). The IL-8
antibody group (~35 μg/animal) or control antibody group (~35 μg/
animal) were injected intraperitoneally every alternate day, starting7 days after the intratibial injections of MDA-MET cells and continuing
for 4 weeks. Animals in the no antibody group did not receive either an-
tiserum and were injected only with PBS.
All mice were followed for periods of up to 4 weeks, then sacri ﬁced
and X-rayed (Kodak X-Omat, Rochester, NY) as described below. Dis-sected legs were processed for histopathology. Tumor growth in bone
was monitored by weekly X-ray of deeply anesthetized nude mice
using an AXR minishot 110 X-ray cabinet (Associated X-ray corporation,
East Haven, CT) at 3 mA, 33 kV for 20 s using Kodak X-Omat TL ﬁlm
(Kodak, Rochester, NY) and processed on a Kodak X-Omat RP automat-edﬁlm processor.
All tumor-bearing and contralateral legs were excised and ﬁxed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin for 2 days. The specimens were then im-
aged in formalin by micro-computed tomography (MicroCT).
Another series of MDA-MET tumor-bearing animals including an IL-
8 antibody group (30 mice) and a control IgG-treated antibody group
(30 mice) were followed speci ﬁcally for survival. Survival was de ﬁned
as time to moribund state or hind limb paralysis, at which point micewere sacri ﬁced. Antibody treatment began on day 5 after tumor inocu-
lation. Analysis of survival endpoints was blinded. All deaths were re-corded throughout the time course of the anti-IL-8 antibody and
control IgG injections (injections were halted at after 28 days of anti-
body injection), corresponding to day 33 following tumor inoculation.
All remaining mice were sacri ﬁced and femurs/tibias harvested.
Human IL-8 transgenic mice
The generation of mice with a liver-speci ﬁc transgene encoding
human IL-8 has been described previously [24].T h e s em i c eh a v ec i r c u -
lating neutrophilia and impaired chemotaxis to intraperitonealthioglycollate, but organ histology and function have been reported as
normal [25], with no description of a bone phenotype. Genotype was
conﬁrmed by the measurement of human IL-8 in mouse serum. IL-8
levels in transgenic mice (hIL-8 Tg) averaged 70 ng/ml and were unde-
tectable in WT mice.
Bone phenotyping
All micro computed tomography (MicroCT) analyses were consis-
tent with current guidelines for the assessment of bone microstructure
in rodents using MicroCT [26]. Formalin- ﬁxed tibiae and femora from
tumor bearing mice and controls, as well as from IL-8 transgenic micewere imaged using a MicroCT 40 (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf,
Switzerland) using a 12 μm isotropic voxel size in all dimensions as
described previously [27]. Three-dimensional reconstructions were cre-
ated by stacking the regions of interest from each two-dimensional slice
and then applying a gray-scale threshold and Gaussian noise ﬁlter as de-
scribed [27] using a consistent and pre-determined threshold (245)
with all data acquired at 55 kVp, 114 mA, and 200-ms integration
time. Fractional bone volume (bone volume/tissue volume; BV/TV)
and architectural properties of trabecular bone (trabecular thickness
(TbTh; μm), trabecular number (TbN; mm
−1), and connectivity density
(Conn. D.; mm3)) were calculated using previously published methods
[28]. In addition, for cortical bone analysis of IL-8 transgenic mice,
MicroCT slices were segmented into bone and marrow regions by ap-plying a visually chosen, ﬁxed threshold (245) for all samples after
smoothing the image with a three-dimensional Gaussian low-pass ﬁlter
(σ= 0.8, support = 1.0) to remove noise. Femoral cortical geometry
was assessed in a 1-mm-long region centered at the femoral midshaft.The outer contour of the bone was found automatically using the
built-in manufacturer's contouring tool. Total area was calculated by
counting all voxels within the contour, bone area by counting all voxels
that were segmented as bone, and marrow area was calculated astotal area −bone area. This calculation was performed on all 25 slices
(1 slice = ~12.5 μm), using the average for the ﬁnal calculation. The
outer and inner perimeter of the cortical midshaft was determined by
a three-dimensional triangulation of the bone surface (BS) of the 25
slices, and cortical thickness and other cortical parameters were deter-
mined as described [27,28] . For bone phenotype assessment of IL-8
transgenic mice, 10 male and 6 female IL-8 transgenic mice (4 months)
and 9 male and 6 female WT littermate controls were examined. Serum
IL-8 levels were measured to determine the genotype of the mice [25],
and blood was drawn and serum prepared for serum bone biochemicalmarker analyses.
Where necessary, mechanical testing of femurs was performed as
described previously [28].B r i eﬂy, specimens were tested at room tem-
perature using a servohydraulic-testing machine MTS 858 Bionex TestSystems load frame (MTS, Eden Prairie, MN) with computer control,
data logging, and calculations of load to failure using TestWorks version
4.0 (MTS). Bones were placed with their anterior side down on two hor-
izontal supports spaced 7 mm apart; the central loading point contacted
the posterior surface of the diaphysis at the midpoint of the bone length.
The loading point was displaced downward (transverse to the long axis
of the bone) at 0.1 mm/s until failure, generating bending in the anteri-
or–posterior plane. Load –displacement data were recorded at 100 Hz
(TestWorks 4.0, MTS) and test curves were analyzed to determine mea-sures of whole-bone strength, primarily peak load and stiffness as we
have described [28]. Load to failure was recorded as the load after a 2%
drop from peak load.
Histology and histomorphometry
Following MicroCT imaging, the specimens were decalci ﬁed in 5%
formic acid with agitation until de emed clear by the ammonium oxalate
endpoint test [9]. The decalci ﬁed specimens were then dehydrated
through graded ethanol, cleared in methyl salicylate, embedded in par-
afﬁn, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) as described [28,29] .I n
each section, 10 ﬁelds were counted at 40× magni ﬁcation, starting one
ﬁeld below the growth plate and proceeding from the cortical surface
on one side to the cortical surface to the other. The histomorphometric
parameters measured included total area, total bone area, tumor area,
bone perimeter, eroded perimeter and osteoclast number as described
previously [9].
Bone resorption and human IL-8 assays
Serum was collected from all animals at the time of sacri ﬁce and was
stored at −80
 °C. Serum was thawed and the assay performed according
to the individual manufacturer's instructions. A RatLaps ELISA (Immuno-
diagnostic Systems Inc., Scottsdale, AZ) was used as a quantitative assay
for the determination of bone-related degradation products fromC-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen in mouse serum. Human IL-8
was measured using a commercially available assay (Alpco, Salem, NH).
Osteoclastogenesis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purchased
(Astarte Biologics, Redmond, WA) and cultured towards osteoclast de-
velopment as described previously [10]. Brie ﬂy, cells were counted
with a hemocytometer and plated in 96 well tissue culture plates at aconcentration of 0.25 million cells in 250 μl volume per well. Macro-
phage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1; 25 ng/ml) was added to allgroups. IL-8(1 –77) and IL-8(6 –77) were tested at different concentra-
tions and RANKL (25 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Cultureswere maintained at 37 °C and half-feeds performed three times per
week and terminated on the 10th day. Medium was aspirated and the
cellsﬁxed with 10% formalin. TRAP staining was performed (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) for quanti ﬁcation of TRAP+ multinucleated cells (MNCs).178 A. Kamalakar et al. / Bone 61 (2014) 176 –185
TRAP+ cells having more than 3 nuclei were counted as osteoclasts,
and osteoclast cell counts in each well were averaged and the results
expressed as the number of TRAP+ MNCs/well per treatment group
(n = 4 wells per treatment) [10].
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Bonferroni's post-test or by Student's t-test as appropriate. All data are
presented as mean ± SEM. p b0.05 between groups was considered sig-
niﬁcant and is reported as such. Survival curves were created using
SigmaStat 2.03 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). The log-rank test
(Wilcox survival) was used to analyze survival data. p b0.05 between
the two treatment groups was considered signi ﬁcant and is reported
as such.
Results
IL-8 is expressed by primary human breast tumors
To determine whether IL-8 was expressed in primary human
breast tumors archival tumor tissue samples from 22 ER+ and 15
ER−invasive ductal breast carcinomas were selected for this study
under an IRB-approved protocol. T he tumors were immunostained
and IL-8 staining intensity graded on a scale of 0 to 3+, with 0
representing no detectable staining and 3+ representing the stron-
gest staining ( Fig. 1 ). 100% of cases examined stained positive for IL-
8 expression. 68% of ER+ cases showed 3+ IL-8 staining comparedwith 47% of ER −cases ( Table 1). No signi ﬁcant difference was ob-
served in the intensity of IL-8 staining between ER+ and ER −
cases. IL-8 expression was common in invasive ductal breast carcino-
mas and the level of IL-8 expression did not correlate with ER status,
indicating that in these samples, IL-8 expression in primary breast
cancer is independent of ER status.
Circulating IL-8 is correlated with bone resorption in breast cancer patients
Since the expression of IL-8 was common in primary human breast
cancer, we next examined circulating IL-8 levels in the plasma of breast
cancer patients with and without clinical evidence of bone metastasis
[30]. Plasma IL-8 levels were signi ﬁcantly elevated in breast cancer pa-
tients with bone metastasis (mean = 4.4 ± 1.8 pg/ml) comparedwith breast cancer patients with no bone metastasis (mean = 2.1 ±
0.9 pg/ml) ( Fig. 2 A). Since these patients also had known serum NTxvalues [30] (a circulating measure of bone resorption) we also deter-
mined if plasma IL-8 was correlated with serum NTx ( Fig. 2 B). Indeed,
there was a signi ﬁcant positive correlation between serum NTx and
plasma IL-8 levels (r = 0.7279). These data demonstrate that IL-8 isexpressed by primary breast tumors, circulates at higher levels in breast
cancer patients with bone metastasis, and is signi ﬁcantly correlated
with bone resorption.
Tumor-derived IL-8 peptides stimulate osteoclastogenesis
MDA-MET cells form large tumor foci with extensive bone destruc-
tion when injected directly into the tibia of nude mice, whereas MDA-
MB-231 cells do not [20]. In addition, the more osteolytic MDA-MET
tumor cells secrete high levels of full length IL-8(1 –77)[20], whereas
the less osteolytic MDA-MB-231 cells secrete a truncated (6 –77) IL-8
isoform [20]. In order to determine the biological activity of these specif-
ic IL-8 isoforms, the ligand binding af ﬁnity of the peptides for the
human IL-8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) was determined usingHEK-293 cells, stably expressing the receptors ( Figs. 3 A,
B) [22].I na d d i -
tion, the capacity of both human IL-8 peptides to stimulate osteoclasto-genesis was determined in cultures of human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells ( Fig. 3 C). IL-8 ligand af ﬁnity binding studies demon-
strated a higher af ﬁnity of IL-8(1 –77) (IC50 ~5 × 10
−9M) than IL-
8(6 –77) (IC50 ~10−6M) for CXCR1, but similar af ﬁnities for CXCR2
(Figs. 3 A, B). Next, we observed that full-length IL-8(1 –77) signi ﬁcantly
stimulated human osteoclast formation at 10 and 100 nM as didIL-8(6 –77), albeit to a signi ﬁcantly lesser extent than IL-8(1 –77)
(Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that human osteoclastogenesis can be in-
duced by both IL-8 peptides, but that the activity of the full length
1–77 peptide is greater than that of the truncated 6 –77 peptide. Inter-
estingly, the pro-osteoclastogenic effect of IL-8 on human osteoclastswas dose-dependently inhibited by Repertaxin, a small molecule inhib-
itor of CXCR1 and 2 [31](Fig. 3 D), with no effect on RANKL-induced os-
teoclastogenesis, demonstrating the direct action of IL-8 on CXCR1expressed on osteoclasts and their precursors [10].

Anti-IL-8 antibody inhibits tumor osteolysis and improves survival
Three groups of MDA-MET tumor-bearing mice were treated with
either a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-8 (35 μg/mouse), or
an isotype control IgG (35 μg/mouse), or no treatment every alternate
day for 4 weeks beginning 7 days after direct tumor cell inoculation
into the tibia. All animals receiving no treatment (15/15) or treated
with control IgG (20/20) developed large osteolytic bone tumors
(Fig. 4 A). No differences in tumor burden or any other tumor parameter
were observed between the untreated or IgG treated control groups. Incontrast, in the IL-8 antibody treated group 15/20 animals had no histo-
logical evidence of tumor. Small tumor foci with no measureable
osteolysis were observed in 3 mice and 2 animals developed small
osteolytic tumors ( Fig. 4 A).The IL-8 antibody treated group had smaller tumors and more
bone remaining than either the IgG-treated or no antibody groups
(Figs. 4 B–D). Both the total area of osteolysis as well as tumor burden
were signi ﬁcantly lower in mice treated with IL-8 antibody compared
with mice receiving control IgG or no treatment. The higher bone area
remaining in the IL-8 antibody group compared with the IgG-treated
or no antibody group was due to decreased number of osteoclasts
(Fig. 4 C) and decreased eroded bone surface (data not shown). In
sum, IL-8 antibody treatment signi ﬁcantly decreased tumor develop-
ment, osteoclast formation and the resultant bone destruction ( Fig. 4 ).
Next, the serum bone resorption marker NTx was measured by
ELISA in IL-8 antibody and IgG-treated tumor-bearing mice, as well as
non-tumor bearing controls. Bone resorption in non-treated tumor
bearing mice was signi ﬁcantly increased compared to both IL-8
Fig. 2. IL-8 expression is signi ﬁcantly correlated with bone resorption. (A) Plasma IL-8 levels measured in breast cancer patients with and without bone metastasis. Bone metastasis

antibody treated and non-tumor bearing mice ( Fig. 4 E). Animals treated
with IL-8 antibody had levels of bone resorption not different from non-
tumor bearing animals ( Fig. 4 E), indicating that the IL-8 antibody de-
creased all the bone resorption associated with the presence of tumor.Since the level of bone resorption in the IL-8 antibody treated group
was not signi ﬁcantly different from the bone resorption in non-tumor
bearing mice, it suggests that tumor-derived IL-8 was entirely responsi-ble for the elevated bone resorption ( Fig. 4 E). Importantly, survival of
tumor-bearing mice treated with IL-8 antibody was signi ﬁcantly
improved ( Fig. 4 F).
IL-8 expression alters the osteolytic phenotype of breast cancer cells
To evaluate the effect of IL-8 expression on the phenotype of MDA-
231 tumor cells in vivo , we engineered a series of MDA-231-derived
cell lines which stably expressed either hIL-8 cDNA (MDA-231-IL8) orhIL-8 antisense cDNA (MDA-MET-AS). Increased expression or knock-
down of IL-8 was con ﬁrmed by IL-8 ELISA ( Fig. 5 ).
All animals injected with MDA-231-IL8 cells secreted high levels of
IL-8 compared with MDA-231 cells ( Fig. 5 A )a n dp r o d u c e dl a r g et u m o r s
with clear evidence of extensive osteolysis ( Fig. 5 B). Histomorphometric
analysis revealed that the animals injected with MDA-231-IL8 cells had
less remaining bone due to increased numbers of osteoclasts (Supple-
mental Figs. 1A, B). No effects on cell proliferation were observed in
MDA-231-IL8 cells in vitro (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Thus, the increased
IL-8 secretion due to transfection of MDA-231 cells with IL-8 cDNA en-hanced both osteoclast formation and bone destruction.In the animals injected with the MDA-MET-AS cells, ~80% had evi-
dence of tumor histologically and the tumor foci were much smaller
than in any of the control MDA-MET injected animals, with few MDA-
MET-AS animals (20%) having evidence of osteolysis ( Fig. 5 D). The
osteolysis appeared to be associated with the diminished levels of IL-8expression by MDA-MET-AS cells ( Fig. 5 C). The reduction in IL-8 secre-
tion in MDA-MET-AS cells signi ﬁcantly decreased tumor burden and
osteoclast formation (Supplemental Figs. 1C, D) as well as bone destruc-
tion in vivo (Fig. 5 D), but had no effect on tumor cell proliferation in vitro
(Supplemental Fig. 2B). The modulation of IL-8 secretion by humanbreast cancer cells signi ﬁcantly and selectively altered osteoclastogene-
sis and bone resorption in vivo .
Skeletal phenotype of human IL-8 transgenic mice
Since we have shown that MDA-MET cells secrete a variety of
osteoclastogenic factors in addition to IL-8 [10,20] , we next evaluated
the bone phenotype of transgenic mice expressing human IL-8 [24]to
conﬁrm that IL-8 overexpression in vivo was indeed responsible for
the profound osteolytic phenotype.
Gross changes in tibial and femoral morphology or bone length of
WT or hIL-8 Tg mice were not apparent (data not shown). However, a
signiﬁcant decrease in the fractional bone volume (BV/TV) of both the
femur and tibia of hIL-8 Tg mice was observed ( Figs. 6 A, B). In addition,
and entirely consistent with the dramatic decrease in BV/TV, trabecular
number (TbN) was signi ﬁcantly decreased, coupled with signi ﬁcantly
increased
trabecular separation (TbSp) with no signi ﬁcant difference
in trabecular thickness (TbTh) in hIL-8 Tg mice ( Figs. 6 C–E). The low

bone mass phenotype was evident in mice as young as 2 months (the
earliest age examined) and was evident in both genders (data not
shown). The MicroCT data analysis presented ( Fig. 6 ) was obtained
from adult mice at 4 months of age.
In addition to the trabecular microarchitecture, the cortical bone ge-
ometry of hIL-8 Tg mice was examined by MicroCT in the mid-diaphysisof the femur ( Fig. 7 ). The cortical thickness of the femur was signi ﬁcantly
decreased in hIL-8 Tg mice ( Fig. 7 ), and medullary area of the femur sig-
niﬁcantly increased by the transgenic expression of hIL-8 ( Fig. 7 C). As
expected, the changes in cortical geometry were re ﬂected in the signif-
icantly decreased peak load-to-failure of femurs from hIL-8 Tg mice,compared with WT control femurs in 3 point bending tests ( Fig. 7 D)
[28].
Consistent with the MicroCT evaluation, histomorphometric analy-
sis of the long bones con ﬁrmed the decreased bone volume (data not
shown) and indicated that this effect was associated mechanistically
with a signi ﬁcant increase in the number of osteoclasts, as measured
by the number of osteoclasts per bone perimeter (NOc/BPm) ( Figs. 8 A,
B). In addition and consistent with the histomorphometry and the
MicroCT analysis, serum measures of NTx, an in vivo biomarker of oste-
oclast activity, revealed a signi ﬁcant increase in bone resorption in hIL-8
Tg mice compared with WT ( Fig. 8 C). No changes in any osteoblast

parameters were observed (data not shown) but there was a striking
and signi ﬁcant increase in marrow adiposity ( Figs. 8 D, E). Collectively,
these data suggest that the decreased bone mass in hIL-8 Tg mice isthe result of increased osteoclast number and activity that is associated
with an increase in marrow fat ( Figs. 8 D, E) and no demonstrable
change in osteoblast parameters driven by transgenic IL-8 expression.Discussion
IL-8 is expressed by a number of cancer cell lines in vitro .Ac o r r e l a t i o n
has been observed between tumor cell expression of IL-8 and metastaticpotential in a variety of cancer settings [8,9,32 –37]. In addition, serum
levels of IL-8 are increased in patients with breast cancer and appear to

be an independent prognostic indicator for post-relapse survival [17,38],
with similar results reported for prostate cancer [39]and squamous cell
carcinoma patients [40]. Others have shown that breast cancer cells can
induce the release of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from activated plate-
lets which, in turn, promotes tumor cell proliferation and the LPA-
dependent secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, thereby enhancing tumor growth
and osteolysis [41].C o l l e c t i v e l y ,t h e s ed a t as uggest that IL-8 expression
is an important mediator of osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction,
once breast cancer cells are seeded in the bone microenvironment [42].
Our data demonstrate that primary human invasive ductal carcino-
mas express IL-8 and that the level of expression does not appear to cor-
relate with ER status. These observations in primary human breast
cancers are contrary to previously published in vitro observations
which have shown that IL-8 expression is signi ﬁcantly correlated with
ER status [43]. Our study also highlights the importance of measuring
circulating IL-8 and demonstrates that tumor osteolysis and circulatingplasma IL-8 levels are signi ﬁcantly positively correlated. In light of pre-
vious observations demonstrating the important role of IL-8 in breastcancer growth, invasion and metastasis [18,42] , further investigation
is warranted to determine if IL-8 is an independent prognostic indicatorin breast cancer.
We have shown that osteolytic MDA-MET cells secrete full-length
IL-8, whereas non-osteolytic MDA-MB-231 cells secrete a truncated
(6–77) form of the protein [20]. Similar IL-8 isoform expression has
also been reported in ovarian cancer [44]. In the current study, the dis-
tinct osteoclastogenic activities of the secreted isoforms of IL-8 and their
speciﬁc CXCR1 binding af ﬁnities correlate with osteoclastogenic activi-
ty. We propose that the MDA-MET breast cancer growth advantage inbone compared with MDA-MB-231 [21]is not due to a simple prolifer-
ative advantage, but to the ability of MDA-MET to profoundly stimulateosteoclastic bone resorption [10],viathe secretion of full-length IL-8.
In vivo , it appears that the increased osteolysis of MDA-MET cells is en-
tirely attributable to increased IL-8 secretion, since inhibition of IL-8 ac-
tivity in MDA-MET tumor bearing mice reduces bone resorption to the
levels found in the serum of non-tumor bearing mice. This idea is fur-
ther supported by the altered phenotype in vivo of breast cancer cells
engineered for increased or decreased expression of IL-8 and by the se-verely osteopenic bone phenotype of hIL-8 Tg mice. In all, these func-
tional data are entirely consistent with our earlier demonstration that
MDA-MET conditioned medium containing IL-8(1 –77) stimulates
human osteoclast formation more than MDA-231 conditioned medium
containing IL-8(6 –77) and that CXCR1 and not CXCR2 is expressed in
human osteoclasts and their precursors [10,20] . The investigation of
the activity of these two IL-8 isoforms in vitro and in vivo is ongoing
and promises to provide new insight into the role of IL-8 in breast cancerp r o g r e s s i o ni nb o n e .
Different amino terminal variants of endogenous IL-8 with similar
relative stability have been described previously [45],w i t hI L - 8 ( 1 –77)
and
IL-8(6 –77) being the major forms derived from endothelial cells
orﬁbroblasts and leukocytes [46,47] . We and others have previously re-
ported tumor-speci ﬁc isoforms [20,44] . In ligand binding assays in other
cell types, some shorter forms of IL-8 have been demonstrated to have
slightly higher af ﬁnity than IL-8(1 –77) [46], provided that the
Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif (found at position 9 –11) remains intact [46].
Although differing af ﬁnities have been reported for these shorter IL-8
isoforms, our study is the ﬁrst to report the altered activity of two IL-8
isoforms on osteoclast formation, demonstrating that full length
IL-8(1 –77) has more potent osteoclastogenic effects than IL-8(6 –77).
Although we and others have shown that tumor-derived IL-8
induces murine osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vivo , these
observations could be explained by the requirement for other tumor-derived activity(s). Hence, we sought to clearly demonstrate that IL-8
was able to induce osteoclast formation in the mouse in vivo in the
absence of tumor, using IL-8 transgenic mice, rather than resolve theIL-8 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues that plague the in-
jection of protein agents into mice.IL-8 transgenic mice are perfectly viable and were ﬁrst reported in
1994 [24]. The mice have been shown to have impaired neutrophil mi-
gration, but no skeletal phenotype has been reported. The mice expressfull length human IL-8(1 –77) selectively in the liver viathe human apoE
promoter and its liver-speci ﬁc enhancer (HCR) [24].I ts h o u l db en o t e d
that mice do not normally express IL-8, but do express an ortholog of
the speci ﬁc IL-8 receptor CXCR1 and are exquisitely sensitive to
human IL-8 [24,25] .
MicroCT analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in BV/TV as well as
micro-architectural parameters of trabecular bone, consistent with se-
vere osteopenia due to markedly increased osteoclastic activity. The
osteopenia was also observed in the cortical compartment. IL-8 Tg
mice had signi ﬁcant decreases in cortical bone geometry leading to de-
creased load to failure (and bone strength). Similarly, histomorphometryand serum measurement of the bone resorption marker NTx demon-
strated a signi ﬁcant increase in bone resorption in IL-8 Tg mice com-
pared with litter mate controls. In support of this notion, TRAP stainingof osteoclasts on the bone surface demonstrated increased numbers of
osteoclasts. These data directly suppo rt our hypothesis that IL-8 is a po-
tent osteoclastogenic agent and that IL-8, independent of other tumor-derived factors, is able to stimulate the induction of osteoclastogenesis
and bone resorption.
Tumor growth in bone depends on a number of factors, including os-
teoclastogenesis, bone resorption, and angiogenesis, as well as cell –cell
interactions [5]. Osteolytic tumor cells accomplish this by secreting fac-
to
rs that increase the number of mature osteoclasts and the activity of
individual osteoclasts and that support angiogenesis, such as IL-8. Anunderstanding at the molecular level of the mechanisms supporting
and stimulating tumor osteolysis, and regulating survival, may provide
important insight into more effective therapies for this devastating
complication of cancer, including ones that target multifunctional mol-
ecules such as speci ﬁcI L - 8i s o f o r m s .
