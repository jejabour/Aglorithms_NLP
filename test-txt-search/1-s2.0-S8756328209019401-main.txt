Micro-CTOsteoclastPolyglycolic acid (PGA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate ( β-TCP) each have many applications as tissue repair
materials. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) porous composite scaffolds of PGA/ β-TCP (in 1:1 and 1:3
weight ratios) were fabricated using the solvent casting and particulate leaching method. PGA/ β-TCP
scaffolds with high porosity, interconnected 3D pores and rough surfaces were obtained and were observed
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The PGA/ β-TCP
scaffolds were investigated during the repair of critical bone defects (3 mm diameter, 2 mm depth) in rat
femoral medial-epicondyles, compared with hydroxylapatite (HAP) and no implant as controls. Quantitativeimageology analysis (volume and density of new bone) and qualitative histological evaluations (hematoxylin
and eosin staining; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-hematoxylin counterstaining) were characterized
using in vivo micro-CT images and histological sections at 0, 14, 30 and 90 days after surgery. Signi ﬁcant
differences of all variables were tested by multivariate analysis ( pb0.05). The results showed that the bone
reformation by using the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds began within 14 days of surgery, and were healing well at
30 days after surgery. By 90 days after surgery, the bone replacement was almost completed and presented ahealthy bone appearance. The new bone mineral densities (mg/cm
3) with HAP, PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) and PGA/
β-TCP (1:3) at 90 days after surgery were: 390.4±18.1, 563.8±26.9 and 606.3±26.9, respectively. The new
bone mineral density with the PGA/ β-TCP scaffold was higher than with HAP ( pb0.001), and with the
PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) scaffold was higher than with the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffold at each time examined
(pb0.05). The biodegradation percents (%) of HAP, PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) and PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) at 90 days after
surgery were: 35.1±5.5, 99.0±1.0 and 96.2±3.3, respectively. The biodegradation percents of the PGA/β -
TCP scaffolds were higher than HAP at each time examined ( pb0.01), and matched the osteogenesis rates.
The PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds were almost replaced by new growing bone within 90 days after surgery. Thus the
PGA/ β-TCP composite scaffold, especially weight ratio 1:3, exhibited a strong ability for osteogenesis,
mineralization and biodegradation for bone replacement.

Introduction
Bone tissue engineering involves methods from materials engi-
neering and from life sciences to create arti ﬁcial constructs for the
regeneration of new bone. One approach is to implant scaffolds for bone
re-growth directly in vivo with the purpose of stimulating and directing
bone formation. The advantage of this approach is the reduced numberof operations needed which results in a shorter recovery time for the
patient, compared to treatment with autograft [1].
Currently, composites of polymers and ceramics are being
developed with the goals of increasing the scaffold mechanical
stability and improving tissue interactions [1]. Calcium phosphate
ceramics have been considered for use as synthetic bone graftsubstitutes for over 30 years. Furthermore, commercial hydroxy-apatite (HAP) and β-tricalcium phosphate ( β-TCP) have been
examined in terms of suitability as a bone substitute in the clinical
setting. Numerous in vivo and in vitro assessments have reported that
β-TCP has excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, and
always supports the attachment, differentiation and proliferation of
relevant cells (such as osteoblasts and mesenchymal cells) [2–6].A n
added advantage is that β-TCP exhibits a faster degradation rate than
crystalline HAP [7]. However, porous pure calcium bioceramics are
brittle and exhibit very slow degradation rates that do not match thegrowth rate of new bone tissues.
On the other hand, biodegradable synthetic polyesters, such as
poly(lactic acid)(PLA), poly(glycolic acid)(PGA) and their copolymer
poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), have a relatively long history of
use in a number of clinical applications [8]. PGA is the only hydrophilic
biodegradable polymer among these polymers [9], and it possesses
suitable mechanical properties, non toxicity and biodegradation,having the fastest degradation rate among these polymers [1,10] .
However, PGA does not present a favorable surface for cell attachmentBone 46 (2010) 386– 395

and proliferation because of the lack of speci ﬁc cell-recognition
signals, and in ﬂammatory reactions occur during biodegradation
since glycolic acid is a degradation product [10,11] . Thus, it is
necessary to add bioactive materials to improve the biological
performance of the scaffold.
By taking advantage of the formability of PGA and the included
controlled-volume fractions of a bioactive ceramic phase, mechanicalreinforcement of the fabricated scaffold can be achieved [12,13] . The
addition of β-TCP can stabilize the physiological pH in the vicinity of
the bone defect, and thus increases the biocompatibility of the
scaffold. With admixtures of β-TCP and PGA, and by manipulation of
the porous structure, a plastic scaffold could be designed to ﬁt the
bone defect exactly, and to improve the biodegradation rate of the
scaffold to match the growth rate of new bone tissues that are
required for bone tissue restitution.
In this study, we used the solvent casting and particle leaching
(SC/PL) method [14] to fabricate highly porous three-dimensional
(3D) biodegradable composite scaffolds from β-TCP and PGA. We
characterized their microscopic and macroscopic structures in vitro ,
and their biocompatibility, osteogenesis and biodegradation in vivo .
Materials and methods
Materials
β-TCP (powder, ρ=3.14 g/cm
3) was kindly supplied by the
Dental biomaterials laboratory of Nihon University School of Dentistry
at Matsudo. PGA (MW=100,000 units, ρ=1.53 g/cm3)w a s
purchased from Polysciences (Tokyo, Japan). 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa ﬂuoro-
2-propanone (HFIP) was purchased from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo,
Japan). Sodium chloride crystals (NaCl) were purchased from Sigma.
The 425 –500μm particle size of NaCl was obtained using sieves
(mesh: 425 μm, 500 μm).
Scaffold fabrication
Porous hybrid scaffolds were prepared using the technology of
solvent casting and particle leaching (SC/PL) as shown in Fig. 1 . PGA is
soluble in highly ﬂuorinated organic solvents (HFIP), due to its high
crystallinity [15]. Because of the corrosive and volatile nature of HFIP,
the entire preparation process was performed in draft equipment
(Dalton®, Tokyo, Japan). The process was based on HFIP used as the
solvent and NaCl crystals as the porogen. Brie ﬂy, PGA was completely
dissolved in HFIP (CO=0.2 g/ml) at room temperature. The β-TCP
powder was then uniformly mixed in the solution. The weight ratiosof PGA: β-TCP were 1:1 and 1:3. The suspensions were dropped into
glass moulds (3 mm inside diameter, 2 mm height) about 1 mm high,then as shaking the mould, as added 0.02 g NaCl crystals (particle size:
425–500μm) into each mould rapidly, until the suspension became
stiff. Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated in draft equipment atroom temperature for 2 days. The matrices were then immersed in
distilled water (changed every 12 h) for 3 days to remove the NaCl.
Eventually, the porous β-TCP/PGA scaffolds were air dried and stored
in an airtight container.Evaluation of scaffold characteristics
The porosity values of the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds were measured by
liquid displacement according to a published method [16,17] ,i na
20 °C constant-temperature room. Using this method, the open
porosity of the sample was calculated by: Porosity=V
2/(V 1+V 2), in
which V1is the volume of PGA/ β-TCP composite skeleton of the
scaffold, and V2is the volume of pores inside the scaffold.
Samples were coated with Au-Pd in an Ion Coater (IB.5, Eiko,
Tokyo, Japan). The pore structures of the scaffolds of PGA/ β-TCP (1:1
and 1:3 ratios) were obtained using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Hitachi S-2700, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 kV.
Samples were soaked in 0.2% agarose solution at 65 °C until no air
bubbles ﬂoated up, and were naturally cooled to a solid gel at room
temperature. Gel-sample pieces were observed using micro-CT (T-mCT, Toscaner-30000, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) with an X-ray source of
74 kV/110 μA.
Implantation for repairing femoral defects
Sprague-Dawley male rats (10 weeks old; body weight 330±10 g;
total of 40 rats) were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Therats were allowed free access to food and water ad libitum at all times
and were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 8:00 to20:00) at 23±1 °C, humidity 60±10% environment for a period of
1 week before use. All rats were maintained and used in accordance
with the guidelines of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo (08-0010).
The 4 material groups tested were: the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffold,
the PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) scaffold, the clinically used 100% HAP (Bone-
Ject
®, Koken, Tokyo, Japan) control and the no implant control. The
left and right femora of rats were divided randomly into 4 time groups
according to the presumptive time when they would be sacri ﬁced, for
a total of 5 samples in each time group for each material group.
All rats were injected intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital
(Somnopentyl®, Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) at a dose of 30 mg/
kg. Under anesthesia, bone defects (3 mm diameter, 2 mm depth),
were made through the cortical bone surface into the cancellous bone
in the medial epicondyles of bilateral femora, using an implant drill
with physiologic saline cooling ( Fig. 2 ). The implant materials were
ﬁlled randomly into 5 left or right femora defects. After surgery, each
rat received an intramuscular injection of sodium ampicillin (Viccil-lin
®, Meiji, Tokyo, Japan) at a dose of 60 mg per 100 g, and was then
returned to its cage and allowed to move freely. All wounds healedgradually and the rats were active with no complications after
surgery. The rats were examined at 0, 14, 30 and 90 days after surgery.
Micro-CT examination
The quantitative imageology analysis of newly-grown bone was
performed using an in vivo micro-CT system (Rigaku -mCT
®, Tokyo,
Japan). Rat femoras were scanned using micro-CT with an X-ray
source of 80 kV/120 μA at 0, 14, 30 and 90 days after surgery. After
anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, each rat was set on the object

stage and imaging was performed on the sample over a full 360°
rotation with an exposure time of 2 min. An isotropic resolution of
100×100×100 μm voxel size was selected, which displayed the micro
structure of rat femora distal cortical bone and cancellous bone. Theoriginal 3D images were displayed and analyzed with I-View
®
software (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan).
3D-Bone analysis for bone mineral density (BMD) and bone quantity
(BV/TV)
The 3D bone architecture at the femoral metaphysis was measured
and structural indices of the femoral implant areas were calculatedusing a morphometric program (TRI/3D-BON; Ratoc System Engi-
neering, Tokyo, Japan). In the 3D analysis, total volume (TV, cm
3),
bone volume (BV, cm3) and bone mineral content (BMC, mg) were
measured directly. Volumetric density (BV/TV, %) was calculated from
BV and TV, while bone mineral density (BMD=BMC/BV, mg/cm3)
was calculated from BV and BMC.
Among those indices, the bone volume to total volume ratio (BV/
TV) evaluates the quantity of new bone, while the density of the newbone could be calculated by BMD measured. The total BMD of new
bone and implanted material in the equal defect area at different
times after surgery was measured and recorded as D
1. The BMD of theimplanted material was measured from the micro-CT images at 0 dayafter surgery and is recorded as D
2. The percent of material
biodegradation at different times after surgery is recorded as P,which was obtained using the method described in “Evaluation of
implant materials biodegradation ”section below. The BMD of new
bone at different times was obtained by: D=D
1−D2×( 1−P).
Histological analysis
Rats were sacri ﬁced under anesthesia using heart-perfusion with
physiologic saline and 10% neutral formalin buffer solution (pH=7.4,
Wako, Tokyo, Japan) at 0, 14, 30 and 90 days (5 rats at each time point
in each group) after surgery. Specimens were ﬁxed with 10% formalin
for 48 h, decalci ﬁed in 10% EDTA (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for
4 weeks, embedded in paraf ﬁn, and cut in 5 μm thick sections. The
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H –E), photo-
graphs were taken and evaluated using light microscopy.
Evaluation of implant material biodegradation
Images of the areas of implanted materials in histological sections
(H&E stained) at different times after surgery were measured using
Canvas™×software (ACD Systems of America, Miami, Florida, USA).
The area data meant the total area of material in the defect area. Areaat 0 day after surgery was recorded as A
1. Area at other times was A2.
The percent of material biodegradation at different times aftersurgery, P, was obtained by: P=(A
1−A2)/A1.
Osteoclasts were stained using TRAP-hematoxylin counterstain-
ing. The sections were TRAP (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)
stained using a TRAP Staining kit®(Primary Cell, Hokkaido, Japan).
Brieﬂy, sections were deparaf ﬁnized using xylene and alcohol, and
were rinsed in running distilled water for 5 min, after which 50 μl
staining solution (3 mg tartaric acid per 50 ml tartaric acid buffersolution, pH 5.0) was dropped on each section. The sections were
incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, until osteoclasts were bright red, and
were then rinsed three times in distilled water. Following counter-
staining in hematoxylin for 2 s, they were washed in running water for
5 min, and then were mounted with aqueous permanent mounting
medium (CC/Mount ™, DBS, Pleasanton, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
All results were expressed as means±SD. Data were analyzed
using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests for pairwise
comparisons (Tukey's test). Differences were considered to besigniﬁcant for pb0.05.
Results
Scaffold characterization
The microstructures of the 3D porous scaffolds of PGA/ β-TCP (1:1,
1:3) fabricated using the SC/PL method were analyzed by SEM ( Fig.
3).Fig. 3 a and b show that both scaffolds had irregular macro-pores
and cubical-like pores. The average pore sizes of PGA/ β-TCP (1:1)
scaffolds and PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) scaffolds were 504.2±93.5 μm and
483.3±113.6 μm, respectively, although that difference was not
statistically signi ﬁcant.
The opening porosities of PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffolds and PGA/ β-
TCP (1:3) scaffolds were 93.6±2.0% and 88.4±0.7%, respectively,
which is a statistically signi ﬁcant difference ( pb0.001).
Fig. 3 c and d show the surface topography of the pore walls in the
scaffolds. The β-TCP particles were uniformly dispersed within the
PGA matrix, and visualization of the micropores due to the
evaporation of solvent reveals that the pore walls of the PGA/ β-TCP
composites are rough. The distinct difference between the two types

thickness) and 3D images of the bone defect (3 mm diameter, 2 mm depth), through
the cortical bone surface into the cancellous bone in the medial epicondyles of bilateral
femora in rats.388 H. Cao, N. Kuboyama / Bone 46 (2010) 386 –395
of PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds was that more β-TCP granules were present
on the pore wall surface of PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) compared to PGA/ β-TCP
(1:1). Thus, compared to the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffold ( Fig. 3 c), the
more gnarled pore wall was found in the PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) scaffold
(Fig. 3 d). Furthermore, the weight ratio of β-TCP determines the
surface roughness of the PGA/ β-TCP scaffold.
Fig. 4 shows a T-mCT image after soaking the scaffold in agar. The
high brightness regions represent pore walls containing β-TCP. Thepores of the scaffold were ﬁlled with gel (griscent region) indicated by
the white arrows. This proves that the pores are interconnected, due
to the leaching of NaCl particles and evaporation of the solvent.
Bone reformation in the femoral defect
Bone repair experiments were carried out using the femoral
medial epicondyle defects (3 mm diameter, 2 mm depth) replaced
with the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds or with HAP. All rats survived after the
surgery, and there were no signi ﬁcant events after surgery or adverse
reactions to the treatment. The animals were examined using in vivo
micro-CT at different time intervals and were sacri ﬁced for histolog-
ical analysis at 0, 14, 30 and 90 days after surgery.
Micro-CT examination and 3D images
Fig. 5 depicts typical micro-CT images of defects during the repair
process in all groups at different times. From 14 to 90 days after
surgery, the brightness of the defect areas in four groups increased
gradually at various degrees, which mean the mineralization and
osteogenesis in progress.
In the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) ( Fig. 5 c) and PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) ( Fig. 5 d)
groups, the mineralization and osteogenesis began throughout defect
area at 14 days after surgery, and advanced rapidly. Until 90 days after
surgery, the defect areas showed the appearance of natural bone and
smooth bone surface shape. Through all the progress of bone
remodeling, the mineralization in PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) group was higher
than in PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) group.
However, in no implant control group ( Fig. 5 a), the mineralization
and osteogenesis began from the basal part of the defect, and grewgradually upward to defect surface layer. Until 90 days after surgery,
remained conspicuous introcession still. In HAP control group ( Fig.
5b), the brightness variation in the HAP control group was not
obvious, due to the large remaining of HAP which could be observedinFig. 6 . Until 90 days after surgery, the surface shape was irregular.

irregular macro-pores and cubical-like pores, c, d (×2000): The rough surface of the PGA/β -TCP scaffold, β-TCP particles are shown by black arrows.
Fig. 4. T-mCT image (74 kV/110 μA, 25 μm slice thickness) is near the center of the PGA/
β-TCP scaffold with agar inside the pores. The high brightness regions are the pore walls
containing β-TCP as the black arrows show. The pores of the scaffold are ﬁlled with gel
(griscent region) as the white arrows show, which proves that the pores are
interconnected.389 H. Cao, N. Kuboyama / Bone 46 (2010) 386 –395
These micro-CT observations indicate that the composite of PGA/
β-TCP allows more rapid mineralization and osteogenesis than both
HAP control group and no implant control group.
BMD and BV/TV analyses
The new bone quantity (BV/TV) of each group at each time is
shown in Fig. 7 . At 14 days, there was a distinction in the new bone
quantity only between the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) group and the HAP group
(pb0.05). Compared to the other groups, there was a markedly
greater quantity of new bone formation in both groups with the PGA/
β-TCP scaffolds than in the other two control groups ( pb0.05) at 30and 90 days after surgery. The BV/TV (%) in the no implant, theHAP, the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) and the PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) groups were
76.5±3.0, 37.3±3.0, 91.7±5.0 and 96.4±2.0, respectively, at90 days after surgery. However, there was no evident distinction
between the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) group and the PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) group
in new bone quantity at any time period observed.
Fig. 8 shows the new bone BMD of each group, which re ﬂects new
bone strength and mineralization at each time point. The BMD (inmg/cm
3) with no implant, HAP, PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) and PGA/ β-TCP
(1:3) were 385.1±19.9, 390.4±18.1, 563.8±26.9 and 606.3±26.9,respectively, at 90 days after surgery. Further, there was no evident
distinction in BMD between the two control groups at 14 days and
Fig. 5. Micro-CT images (80 kV/120 mA, 100 μm slice thickness) showing the mineralization and osteogenesis of the rat femoral distal end implants of each group at 0, 14, 30 and
90 days post-surgery. At 90 days after surgery, there is good bone appearance with the PGA/β -TCP groups (c-90, d-90), an irregular surface with the HAP group (b-90) and a
conspicuous introcession remained with the no implant group (a-90), shown by arrows. (a) No implant group, (b) HAP group, (c) PGA/ β-TCP (1:1), (d) PGA/ β-TCP (1:3), dashed

Fig. 7. New bone volume to total volume ratio (BV/TV, %) of each group evaluating the quantity of new bone. The BV/TV of the two PGA/b-TCP scaffolds is greater than the pure HAP
group at 30 and at 90 days ( pb0.001). ( ⁎pb0.05, ⁎⁎pb0.01, ⁎⁎⁎pb0.001, n=5).391 H. Cao, N. Kuboyama / Bone 46 (2010) 386 –395
between the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) group and the no implant control
group at 30 days.
InFigs. 7 and Fig. 8 , both BV/TV and BMD of new bone in HAP
group were the lowest among the four groups, which seemed not
consistent with Fig. 5 . The reason was that reported BMD data all
described new bone mineralization, which subtract the BMD of thematerials, but the density of HAP was highest among the implanted
materials and the large remaining of HAP at different times which
could be observed in Fig. 6 . Thus, the brightness of HAP at different
times seemed highest among the four groups and its variation was notobvious in micro-CT images ( Fig. 5 ).
These results indicate that the PGA/ β-TCP composite allows
more rapid mineralization and osteogenesis than does pure HAP,
which is consistent with the in vivo micro-CT images described
above.
Histological analysis (H –E staining)
Photomicrographs of cross-sections (H –E staining) through the
femoral medial epicondyle bone defect sites of all groups at different
times after surgery are presented in Fig. 6 .
From day 0 to 90 days, the defect sites implanted with PGA/ β-TCP
(1:1) or PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) had a similar histological appearance(Fig. 6 c and d). At 90 days, both PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds were substituted
almost completely by newly formed bone, and the newly formed
bones possessed intact structures of femora metaphysis, including
continuous cortical bone on the surface and cancellous tissue with the
marrow cavity ﬁlled with bone marrow spread throughout in the
cancellous bone.
The biodegradation of HAP was slow, and still remained mostly at
90 days ( Fig. 6 , b-90). In the no implant control, without support
materials, the new bone grew from the basal part, and the rate of bone
formation was slow, and at 90 days there was only a small defect
without bone repair ( Fig. 6 a-90).
Biodegradation of implanted materials
The percent of material biodegradation at different times after
surgery is shown in Fig. 9 . At 90 days, the biodegradation percents
(%) of HAP, PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) and PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) were 35.1±5.5,
99.0±1.0 and 96.2±3.3, respectively. Both PGA/ β-TCP groups were
markedly faster than the HAP group ( pb0.05), and had almost
completed their biodegradation at 90 days after surgery.
These results indicate that the biodegradation rate of PGA/ β-TCP
scaffolds allowed a more rapid replacement and osteogenesis than
does HAP.

90 days after surgery. ( ⁎pb0.01, n=5).392 H. Cao, N. Kuboyama / Bone 46 (2010) 386 –395
TRAP-hematoxylin counterstaining
InFig. 10 , TRAP-hematoxylin counterstaining revealed a few
osteoclasts that appeared on the PGA/ β-TCP surface within 14 days
after surgery. At 30 days after surgery, many osteoclasts were
observed around the PGA/ β-TCP surface, which suggests that the
PGA/ β-TCP is bio-resorbed rapidly. At 90 days after surgery,
osteoclasts were around the remaining PGA/ β-TCP and the new
growing bone to complete the PGA/ β-TCP bioresorption and bone
remodeling. However, around the HAP implant, osteoclasts increasedweakly from 14 days to 90 days after surgery.
Discussion
Tissue engineering provides a new approach for the therapy of
damaged tissues or failed organs. The development of bone tissue
engineering is directly related to changes in materials technology,
especially the development of biomaterials that can be used in the
reconstruction of large orthopedic defects and are mechanically more
suitable to their biological environments [18]. Therefore, we prepared
3D porous scaffolds with composites of PGA and β-TCP for use as bone
repair substitutes.Scaffolds synthesized for osteogenesis should mimic bone mor-
phology, structure and function to optimize their integration into thesurrounding tissue. It is well known that bone is a structure composed
of hydroxyapatite (Ca
10(PO 4)6(OH) 2) crystals deposited within an
organic matrix (95% is type I collagen) [19]. Ozawa et al. [20]reported
clinical results for 87 bone tumor patients who received highly
puriﬁedβ-TCP implants for repairing their bone defect. None of them
developed fractures or deformities, and the radiograms showed
marked radiological remodeling around the β-TCP because of its
excellent absorbability and osteoconduction. The particles provideanchorage for osteoblastic cells and provide a more favorable surface
for cell attachment, which determines the ability of the material to
support bone ingrowth or to act as a biological template [21].A sa n
apatite-organic polymer composite, the PGA/ β-TCP we prepared
mimics the components of natural bones, where β-TCP is distributed
uniformly in the PGA matrix. The polymer PGA in the scaffoldfunctions as a collagen matrix in the bone, providing structural
support for osteogenesis. By taking advantage of the solubility and re-
formability of PGA, we obtained shapes that closely ﬁt the bone
defects. This can prevent the growth of ﬁbrous tissue around the
defect, and advances the bone formation rate until the defect is
repaired to its normal tissue appearance. The results show that the

porous scaffold of PGA/ β-TCP exhibits better biocompatibility as a
substrate for cell growth and migration in vivo when used as a bone
repair substitutes.
Surface topography is important for cell attachment [21]. The pore
wall roughness plays an important role in osteogenic outcome as does
the macroporosity (pore size N50μm)[22]. Surface roughness is
thought to enhance attachment, proliferation and differentiation of
anchorage-dependent bone-forming cells [23]. The surface energy
may play a role in attracting particular proteins to the surface of thematerial and, in turn, this will affect the af ﬁnity of cells to the material
[18]. To overcome the problem with the homogeneity of the polymer
phase and the inorganic bioactive phase reported previously using the
SC/PL method, we incorporated a uniformly inorganic bioactive phase
(β-TCP powder) into the solution before adding the solution to the
model ( Fig. 1 ). Compared to PGA, the porous scaffold of PGA/ β-TCP
produces rougher pore walls due to the particles attached or inlayed
on the surface of the wall. Moreover, the surface of the PGA/ β-TCP
(1:3) scaffold is rougher than the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffold.
The processes of in vivo mineralization and biodegradation are
complex for porous composite scaffolds of β-TCP particles (about
15μm in diameter, Fig. 3 c and d) inset or protruding from the surface
of the PGA matrix. The balance of mineral deposition, biodegradationand tissue regeneration changes greatly at different times after
surgery. Our bone repair studies with rats demonstrate that the PGA/
β-TCP scaffold affords an early bioresorption along with replacement
by newly formed bone ( Fig. 6 ).Figs. 6 ,7 and 9 showed that the
degradation rates of the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds (1:1 and 1:3) adjusted
to match the rate of bone tissue regeneration. However, the slowdegradation of HAP does not offer new bone space to grow over
measured time periods, which might hold back the new bone growth.
Thus, PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds are more suitable as a bone replacement
material.
We presume that the chemical formula of the biodegradation
reaction is as follows: nCa
9(HPO 4)(PO 4)5(OH)+( –OCH 2CO–)n+
nH2O→3nCa 3(PO 4)2+(HOCH 2COOH)n+nH 2O. Upon hydrolysis,
the long PGA ﬁbers are degraded into shorter ﬁbers, and eventually,
decompose into polymer powders and ﬁnally to glycolic acid [18]. The
degradation product, glycolic acid, is non-toxic and can enter thetricarboxylic acid cycle after which it is excreted in part as water and
carbon dioxide and in part as glycolic acid in the urine. Some glycolicacid could turn into glycine, which can be metabolized by the
tricarboxylic acid cycle [24]. The tri-calcium phosphate degraded from
β-TCP can stabilize the physiological pH, which is disrupted due to the
degradation product (glycolic acid) of PGA. This further increases the
biocompatibility of the scaffold and completes its avirulent metabolic
process. A study by Kondo et al. [4]showed that osteoclasts, which
adhere to β-TCP, resorb β-TCP implants continuously from 4 to 56
days after surgery. In our study, osteoclasts around PGA/ β-TCP were
also observed at all stages by TRAP-hematoxylin counterstaining, andtheir quantity markedly increased at 30 days after surgery ( Fig. 10 ).
In addition, the content of β-TCP in the composite is also an
important factor for mineralization and osteogenesis. The BMD
analyses also con ﬁrm in quantity that the new BMD with the PGA/
β-TCP (1:3) scaffold is higher than with the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1) scaffold
(Fig. 8). We conclude that the main reason for this is that the content
ofβ-TCP (or the level of Ca and P) in PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) is higher than in
PGA/ β-TCP (1:1). Therefore, in subsequent research, the weight ratio
ofβ-TCP should be further increased and the initial levels of Ca and P
in the materials should be designed to assess the composites of apatite
and polymers as bone repair substitutes.
Conclusion
3D porous scaffolds that are composites of PGA and β-TCP were
prepared using the SC/PL method, which have suitable shapes for the
bone defects, a rough surface, high open porosity and interconnectedpores. The bone replacement study with the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds in
rats showed that the scaffolds have osteoconductivity very early,
encourage rapid bone formation and result in the appearance of
natural bone in the replaced areas. Furthermore, the degradation rates
of the scaffolds adjust to match the rate of tissue regeneration, and it is
expected that the PGA/ β-TCP scaffolds will disappear completely
when the tissue is repaired.
As a bone repair substitutes, the PGA/ β-TCP (1:3) scaffold has
more rapid and stronger osteoconductivity than the PGA/ β-TCP (1:1)
scaffold for repairing femoral defects. We conclude that the compositescaffold of PGA/ β-TCP, especially in the weight ratio of 1:3, exhibits a
strong ability for mineralization, osteogenesis and biodegradationduring bone replacement process.
