Tibia calcium and phosphorusSilicon-de ﬁciency studies in growing animals in the early 1970s reported stunted growth and profound defects in
bone and other connective tissues. However, more recent attempts to replicate these ﬁndings have found mild
alterations in bone metabolism without any adverse health effects. Thus the biological role of silicon remains
unknown. Using a speci ﬁcally formulated silicon-depleted diet and modern methods for silicon analysis and
assessment of skeletal development, we undertook, through in ternational collaboration between silicon researchers,
an extensive study of long-term silicon depletion on ske letal development in an animal. 21-day old female Sprague –
Dawley rats ( n=20) were fed a silicon-depleted diet (3.2 µg Si/g feed) for 26 weeks and their growth and skeletal
development were compared with identical rats ( n=10) on the same diet but with silicon added as Si(OH) 4to their
drinking water (53.2 µg Si/g water); total silicon intakes were 24 times different. A third group of rats, receiving a
standard rodent stock feed (322 µg Si/g feed) and tap water (5 µg Si/g water), served as a reference group for optimal
growth. A series of anthropometric and bone quality me asures were undertaken during and following the study.
Fasting serum silicon concentrations and especially urinary silicon excretion were signi ﬁcantly lower in the silicon-
deprived group compared to the supplemented group ( P=0.03 and 0.004, respectively). Tibia and soft-tissue silicon
contents did not differ between the two groups, but tibia silicon levels were signi ﬁcantly lower compared to the
reference group ( Pb0.0001). Outward adverse health effects were not observed in the silicon-deprived group.
However, body lengths from week 18 onwards ( Pb0.05) and bone lengths at necropsy ( P≤0.002) were longer in this
group. Moreover, these measures correlated inversely with serum silicon concentrations ( P≤0.02). A reduction in
bone growth plate thickness and an apparent increase in c hondrocyte density were also observed in the silicon-
deprived animals. No other differences were observed between the two groups, exc ept for tibia phosphorus
concentrations, which were lower in the silicon-deprived animals ( P=0.0003). Thus in this study we were unable to
reproduce the profound de ﬁciency state reported in rats and chicks in the e arly 1970s. Indeed, although silicon intake
and circulating fasting serum levels differed between the silicon-deprived and silicon-supplemented animals, tibia

differences between the formulated low-Si and reference diets suggest that one or more co-factors may be absent
from the low-Si diet that affect silicon incorporation into bone. However, evidence for urinary silicon conservation (to
maintain tissue levels), changes in bone/body lengths, bon e calcium:phosphorus ratio and differences at the growth
plate with silicon deprivation are all novel and deserve furt her study. These results suggest that rats actively maintain
body silicon levels via urinary conservation, but the low circulating serum silicon levels during silicon de ﬁciency
result in inhibition of growth plate closure and increased longitudinal growth. Silicon-responsive genes and Si
transporters are being investigated in the kidneys of these rats.

Introduction
Silicon (Si) is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust
[1]and is found in all living organisms including man, where the
highest concentrations are reported in bone and other connective
tissues [2]. It is present in blood at concentrations that are in the range
of typical physiologically important elements, such as copper and zinc[3]. It is a major trace element in animal diets, and humans ingest
between 20 –50 mg/d in the Western diet [4–6]. Main dietary sources
are whole grain cereals and their products (including beer), rice, some
fruits and vegetables and drinking water, especially bottled mineral
waters [4,6,7] . Meat and dairy products have low levels of Si [6,7] .
Intestinal absorption is dependent on the chemical form: i.e. mono-
meric silicic acid (orthosilicic acid), present in beverages such as beer
and water, or partially produced by digestion of foods in the gut lumen,
is efﬁciently absorbed whereas polymeric (colloidal) silica are poorly
absorbed [4,8] . Thus it has been suggested that Si may have an
important role in biology beyond being a ‘ubiquitous contaminant ’[9].
Indeed, Si-deprivation experiments in the early 1970s in growing
chicks [10] and rats [11] reported that Si was required for normal
growth and development in higher animals, since Si de ﬁciency
produced stunted growth and profound defects in bone and
connective tissues [10,11] . Skull deformities (shorter skull and
distortion around the eye sockets), shorter, thinner and more ﬂexible
limbs bones that were easily fractured and, the absent of wattle and
comb (in the chick) were reported in the Si-deprived animals [10,11] .
In the rat, hair loss, seborrhoea, loss of muscle tone, disturbances in
enamel development and impairment of incisor pigmentation were
also observed [11]. These ﬁndings, indicative of a role for Si in
c o n n e c t i v et i s s u ef o r m a t i o n ,h a v eb e e ns u p p o r t e db yf u r t h e r
observations such as: (i) the presence of high concentrations of non-
dialysable Si in connective tissues and their components ( [12] and
Jugdaohsingh et al., unpublished data), (ii) the localisation of Si at the
growing front of bone [2], (iii) in vitro studies showing increased
synthesis of matrix polysaccharides and proteins with Si supplemen-
tation [2,13] and (iv) the requirement of Si for optimal prolyl
hydroxylase activity, the enzyme involved in collagen synthesis [2,13] .
More recently, a number of in vitro studies using human
osteoblast-like cells, and in vivo studies in animals and man, have
also added to the evidence that Si may be bene ﬁcial for bone
formation, and for bone and connective tissue health [2,14 –25]. The
exact mechanisms of action of Si on bone are still unclear, and both a
metabolic role (a co-factor for prolyl hydroxylase) and a structural role
(stabilisation of collagen) have been proposed
[2,13,25] . Thus, whether
Si is truly required for optimal skeletal growth in humans or other
animals is not known.
More recent studies investigating the essentiality of Si in growing
animals 26–35]have failed to reproduce the dramatic results reported
by Carlisle [10] and by Schwarz and Milne [11], although various
moderate effects on bone metabolism have been observed. Differ-
ences in experimental conditions such as duration of the experiment,
age and gender of the animals, Si source and route of administration,
as well as overall nutritional compositions of the basal diet may all
contribute to the inter-experimental variance. Notably, early studies
used simpli ﬁed amino acid-based diets with, apparently, the addition
of suf ﬁcient and balanced amounts of vitamins (at 1%) and other
minerals for optimal/near optimal growth [36,37] . However, a co-
deﬁciency cannot be ruled out. The exact composition of the rat basal
diet was not found on literature search, but the composition of basal
diet used in the chick studies was similar to the formulated low-Si diet
used here (i.e. all vitamins and minerals were present; see Table 1 ),
apart from the chick diet being amino acid-based rather than casein/
corn-based used here [37]. Moreover, it is unlikely with the
methodology of the time that the absolute content of Si in the basal
diet could be assessed, although in the rat study it was reported as
b5 µg Si/g feed [11].Since then only one group [29–34]has been able to achieve similar
low dietary levels of Si for animal studies ( circa 3 µg Si/g feed), while
methods for accurate analysis of Si and other micronutrients, as well
as measurement of skeletal health, have greatly advanced. Thus,
drawing on the collaborative expertise of some research groups in Si
and health we set out to determine the role of Si in growth and
development, and in particular skeletal development, in the rat using
as p e c i ﬁcally formulated low Si-containing feed and a low Si-
containing drinking water with and without Si supplementation. A
group of rats on a standard rodent stock feed and drinking water
served as reference for normal anthropogenic measures. The standard
rodent stock feed was higher in Si content than our formulated low-Si

were not compared in this study with regards to the effect of silicon.
Materials and methods
Experimental groups
Forty weanling (21 d old) female Sprague –Dawley rats (B&K Universal Ltd; Hull, UK)
were separated into eight plastic cages with stainless-steel-grid bases (North Kent Plastics,Rochester, UK) with ﬁve rats per cage. Female rats were chosen, as they are generally less
aggressive and more easily handled than males. This study was started prior to our 2004
publication reporting a more marked association between dietary Si intake and bonemineral density in pre-menopausal women compared to men and post-menopausalwomen, suggesting a Si –estrogen interaction [18]. After acclimatisation for three days on a
standard pelleted rodent feed (B&K Rat and Mouse Standard Diet; B&K Universal Ltd) anddrinking water (tap water), rats were divided into three dietary groups.
Group 1 (Si-deprived)
This group consisted of twenty rats (see below). They were weighed on a precision
balance accurate to 0.1 g (Sartorius Ltd, Epsom, UK) and their length, including tail,measured with a ruler to the nearest 0.1 cm. Rats were then fed ad libitum a speci ﬁcally
formulated non-pelleted low-Si rodent feed (prepared by one of the authors (FN) aspreviously described [29–34]) containing all essential nutrients, but with a Si content of
only 3.2±0.6 μg Si/g feed ( n=6 batches; see Table 1 ). The vitamin K content was 15-fold
lower compared to standard rodent stock feed, but was identical to the vitamin K
requirement published for laboratory animals [38]. These animals also received ultra-
high purity (UHP) water (18 M Ωcm
−1, from an Elga water puri ﬁer; High Wycombe, UK),
of low Si content (15.2±9.6 ng Si/g; n=5), ad libitum . The rat feed was easily accessible
from a stainless-steel food tray and replaced with fresh food every 2 –3 days. Similarly,
drinking water (UHP water) in the plastic bottles (North Kent Plastic) was renewedevery other day. Stainless steel grid base cages were used to minimise coprophagia.
This group consisted of twice the number of animals as the Si-supplemented group
as it was planned that half the animals would be supplemented with Si (in their
drinking water) on observation of external signs of Si de ﬁciency, to show that it was the
effect of Si-depletion and not some other factor.
Group 2 (Si-supplemented)
This group consisted of ten rats that were similarly treated and maintained as
described above (Group 1), but the UHP drinking water was supplemented with siliconat 53.2±0.6 μg Si/g ( nN10), in the form of readily absorbable orthosilicic acid (see
below). This is the highest concentration that can be prepared in solution while
maintaining silicon in the soluble, monomeric and highly bioavailable form [8,39] .
Group 3 (reference group)
This group consisted of ten rats housed and measured as described above (Group 1),
but maintained on standard rodent stock feed (B&K Rat and Mouse Standard feedcontaining 322±47 µg Si/g feed, n=5 batches; see Table 1 ) and tap water (5.04±1.12 μg
Si/g; n=5), both ad libitum . This was the reference group for normal anthropometric
and bone quality measures.
Study design
Rats were maintained as described above (at 22 °C, with 12/12 h light/dark cycle)
with free access to feed and water for 26 weeks. A sample of the feeds and drinkingwaters was collected every month and analysed for total Si content (see below). Feedand water intake was measured per cage (5 animals to a cage) at 17 and 25 weeks.Animals were not pair-fed in this study, as intakes were not expected to be differentbetween the groups. Previous studies reported that Si supplementation does not impacton feed consumption, body weight gain, or feed ef ﬁciency [40].
Rat weights and lengths were measured weekly. A blood sample from the tail vein
was collected monthly from six-hour fasted rats (only access to UHP water was allowed)in each group for longitudinal analysis of bone markers (CTx-I, osteocalcin, IGF-1, CTx-II; see below). A urine sample was also collected towards the end of the study (week 25)from fasted rats for assessment of urinary bone resorption markers and urinary Siexcretion. Prior to sacri ﬁce, rats were double-labelled with tetracycline-HCl for bone
histomorphometric analyses (see below).
After 26 weeks all animals were sacri ﬁced, equally between groups, over a period of
eight days to allow time for tissue processing. Animals were starved from 1700 h the
day before by removal of their feed and drinking water, and only UHP water of low Sicontent was allowed. Rats were sacri ﬁced by asphyxiation (schedule 1 method) with
carbon dioxide gas in a specially constructed chamber. Animals were then weighed andthe peritoneum opened longitudinally. The abdominal aorta and vena cava, mesentericarteries and heart were drained using a 19-gauge needle (Terumno; Terumno EuropeNV) and 10 mL low Si-contaminating syringe (Monovette; Sarstedt, Beaumont Leys,UK). After clotting, blood samples were centrifuged (1500 rpm for 10 min at room
temperature), and serum separated into transport tubes (Medfor Products Ltd;
Farnborough, UK) and stored at −70 °C for later analysis of bone markers and Si
concentration (see below). Kidneys, spleen and liver were removed, washed thoroughlywith UHP water, blotted dry on non-shedding paper towels and placed in 25-mL pre-weighed universal polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt) and their weight determined to thenearest 0.1 mg before frozen storage ( −20 °C, livers at −80 °C) for later microwave-
assisted acid digestion and analysis of Si content (see below). Femurs, tibias, humeri,and lumbar vertebrae (between ﬁrst rib and pelvis) were dissected and freed of soft
tissue (i.e. cleaned to the bone). The right tibia was immediately placed into Burkhardtﬁxative solution (see below) for 24 h at 4 °C and thereafter stored in 70% ethanol for
later histomorphometric analyses (see below). For the other dissected bones, their mass(to nearest 0.1 mg) and length (to nearest 0.1 mm using callipers; VWR International)were determined before being placed into tubes and stored at −20 °C. To avoid
dehydration and loss of moisture during storage, dissected bones were stored with 1 –2
drops of UHP water. Dissected bones were analysed for bone mineral density (BMD), Siand other bone-associated mineral content, hydroxyproline concentration, mechanicalstrength and histomorphometry (see below).
The study was approved by King's College London Animal Ethics Committee and by
the UK Home Of ﬁce (Animals Scienti ﬁc Procedures Act 1986; Scienti ﬁc Procedures on
Living Animals).
Formulated low-Si rat feed
The speci ﬁcally formulated rodent feed was prepared/mixed fresh every month (see
Table 1
for list of constituents) in the US and shipped to the UK where the experiment
was undertaken and where it was stored at −20 °C and thawed and used as required.
Preparation of orthosilicic acid
Orthosilicic acid solution (1.9 mmol/L Si), for the Si-supplemented rats, was
prepared fresh, weekly, as described previously [8,39,41] . Brie ﬂy, concentrated basic
sodium silicate (Aldrich Chemical Co., Poole, UK) was diluted in 2.5 L ultra-high puritywater, followed by pH neutralisation to 7.2 with 5 mol/L hydrochloric acid (volumetricstandard; Aldrich Chemical Co.). The solution was allowed to stand at roomtemperature for at least 24 h prior to use. A 10 mL aliquot was taken for total Si analysis.
Silicon intake
Feed and water intakes were measured towards the end of the study. Brie ﬂy, at 17
and 25 weeks the feed tray and water bottles of each cage were appropriately ﬁlled and
weighed (to the nearest 0.1 g). Twenty-four hours later the feed tray and water bottleswere re-weighed to measure the loss in mass due to intake by the rats. This 24 hmeasurement was immediately repeated for another three subsequent 24 h periods andthe mean feed and water intakes were thus calculated for each cage and each group and
thus also mean 24 h (daily) Si intake for each group.
Monthly blood collection and preparation
A fasting blood sample was collected monthly from half the animals in each group
(10 rats in the Si-deprived group; ﬁve from each of the other two groups), but
alternating monthly between the two halves in each group. Animals were fasted from
0900 h by removal of their feed but all had access to UHP water. Six hours later, at
1500 h, up to a maximum of 1 mL blood/rat was collected by venepuncture of the tailvein using a 23-gauge needle (Terumo Europe NV, Belgium) but without use of asyringe. Prior to blood collection, rats were ‘warmed ’using a heating pad and box
(Tecniplast, Kettering, UK) and then restrained (Vet-Tech Solutions Ltd, Congleton, UK).Blood was collected directly into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (Greiner Bio-One Ltd,Stonehouse, UK) and allowed to clot before centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min atroom temperature. Serum was separated into Eppendorf tubes and stored at −70 °C.
Fasting urine sample
Three weeks prior to sacri ﬁce, a spot urine sample was collected by bladder
massage from 6-h fasted rats. Urine samples were successfully collected from eight ratsin the Si-deprived group, ﬁve in the Si-supplemented group and seven in the standard
rodent stock feed-fed reference group and were stored in Eppendorf tubes at −70 °C
until later analysis of Si concentrations and bone resorption markers.
Tetracycline double labelling
To locate the growing bone front and measure the rate of bone apposition/
formation over a six-day period, and the in ﬂuence of dietary Si, rats were injected with
tetracycline 7 days and 1 day prior to sacri ﬁce (i.e. on two occasions, six days apart).
Tetracycline localises to the growing bone front, the site of bone formation/mineralisation. Tetracycline-HCl (Sigma Chemical Co) solution, 10 mg/mL, was preparedjust prior to use by dissolving the powder in sterile saline (0.9% w/v NaCl) and thesolution sterilised by ﬁltration through a 0.2 μm membrane ﬁlter (Nalgene, surfactant
free cellulose acetate; VWR International). Animals were administered tetracycline
(30 mg/kg body weight) by injection into the intraperitoneal cavity (lateral below thenavel) using a 25-gauge needle, 7 days and 1 day prior to sacri ﬁce.
Burkhardt ﬁxative solution
The right tibia from each rat, collected at sacri ﬁce, was immediately ﬁxed in
Burkhardt ﬁxative [42], prior to embedding in methyl methacrylate and sectioning for598 R. Jugdaohsingh et al. / Bone 43 (2008) 596 –606
histomorphometric analyses. Burkhardt ﬁxative ﬁxes the tissue components in place
and reduces leaching of the tetracycline labels. Burkhardt solution was prepared fresh,daily, by mixing 12.5 mL neutralised formaldehyde (37% w/v) with 24 mL absolutemethanol, 0.5 mL phosphate buffer (prepared by dissolving 1.92 g disodium hydrogen
phosphate and 0.348 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate in 100 mL UHP water), and
0.5 mL 6.16% glucose (prepared by dissolving 6.16 g glucose monohydrate in 100 mLUHP water). The solution was cooled to 4 °C prior to use.
Analyses
Bone mineral density
The right femur and lumbar vertebrae (L1 –L4) were analysed for
bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Hologic QDR-2000; S/N 2484)adapted for use with small animals. Measurements at the femur were at
four regions of interest (from the midshaft (H1; primary cortical bone) tothe distal metaphysis (H4; trabecular bone)) and from the total femur as
previously described [15]. Similarly, for the lumbar spine, measurement
was at the individual vertebra (L1, L2, L3 and L4) as well as for the total
lumbar spine (L1 –L4). Values are the average of two measurements.
Bone markersSerum
Fasted serum samples, collected at sacri ﬁce, were analysed for a
number of bone formation and resorption markers using commercially
Fig.1. Fasting serum Si (A) and urinary Si excretion (B), and Si contents of the left tibia (C) and liver (D) of the rats in the Si-deprived group ( n=20 rats), Si-supplemented group ( n=1 0)
and reference group ( n=10 rats on the standard rodent stock feed). [Urine samples were only available for eight rats in the Si-deprived group, ﬁve rats in the Si-supplemented group
and seven rats in the reference group.] Fasting serum Si and urinary Si excretion were signi ﬁcantly lower in the Si-deprived group compared to the Si-supplemented group ( P=0.03
and P=0.004, respectively; unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test). However, there were no signi ﬁcant differences in Si contents of the left tibia and the liver between the two groups.

available kits. The bone formation markers were osteocalcin (Rat-Mid
Osteocalcin; Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S, Denmark) and alkaline
phosphatase (Sigma Chemical Co.). The resorption markers were
C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx-I or RatLaps; Nordic
Bioscience Diagnostics A/S), intact parathyroid hormone (Immunotopics
Inc Rat intact PTH; Quidel Diagnostics, Wheatley, UK), tartrate resistance
acid phosphatases (SBA Sciences RatTRAPS; Quidel Diagnostics) and free(i.e. non-protein bound) and total pyridinium (Metra PYD; Quidel
Diagnostics) and deoxy-pyridinium (Metra DPD; Quidel Diagnostics)
cross-links. Osteopontin (TiterZyme EIA; Assay Designs Inc, Ann Arbor,
USA) and sialic acid (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Lewes, UK) were also
measured in these samples. For the serum samples collected monthly
during the study, CTx and osteocalcin were measured ( ap r i o r i )b e c a u s eo f
the likely role of Si in collagen turnover (CTx) and bone formation
(osteocalcin). Insulin-like growth fac tor 1 (IGF-1; Octeia Rat/Mouse IGF-
1; IDS Ltd, UK), total serum estradiol (Department of Chemical Pathology,
St Thomas' Hospital) and serum CartiLaps (CTx-II; Nordic Bioscience
Diagnostics A/S) were also measured post hoc (i.e. after assessment of the
other results) in these monthly serum samples.
Urine
Fasting urine samples were analysed for bone resorption markers;
CTx-I (RatLaps; Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S), helical peptide
(Metra, Quidel Diagnostics) and free and total PYD and DPD (Metra,
Quidel Diagnostics). Concentrations of these markers in urine were
corrected/normalised for urinary creatinine (Metra, Quidel Diagnostics).
Left femur
The left femur was analysed for hydroxyproline as a measure of its
collagen/matrix content. The procedure was based on acid hydrolysis
of the bone and subsequent determination of the free hydroxyproline
in the hydrolysates [33,43] . Brie ﬂy, chloramine-T hydrolyses hydro-
xyproline to a pyrrole derivative. This was then reacted with 4-
dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (p-DAB) in an acid medium to form a
chromophore (Ehrlich's reaction) the absorption of which was
measured at 570 nm. The colour (chromophore) was enhanced by
the addition of isopropanol.
Bone mechanical properties
Torsional properties of the left femur were measured as described
by Jiang et al. [44]. The test machine (Biomechanical Laboratory,
Cleveland, OH, US) allowed high strain rates (loading time to fracture
less than 100 ms) which are representative of in vivo conditions. Data
from strength and displacement transducers were recorded with a
Biomation Waveform Recorder model 1015 and processed with a PC.
Applied load as a function of time was recorded continuously. The
femur was embedded at both ends in rectangular epoxy blocks, ﬁtting
the grips of the torsional test machine. After the torsion test, no
permanent distortion between the bone and the embedding material
could be observed.
Bone histomorphometry
Histomorphometric analyses were performed as previously
described [45]. Measurements were conducted at the primary
spongiosa.
Elemental analysesMicrowave-assisted acid digestion
All feeds and tissues (right kidney, spleen, liver and left tibia) were
digested in acid prior to elemental analysis. Brie ﬂy, feeds (0.1 –0.3 g)
were digested in 10 mL of a 1+1 mixture of UHP nitric acid (65% w/v;
Fluka; Aldrich-Sigma Chemical Co.) and UHP water in acid-cleaned
100 mL TFM vessels in an Ethos Plus Microwave Labsystem (MilestoneSrl; Sorisole, Italy). Microwave conditions were: 10 min ramp to 180 °C
and maintained at 180 °C for 15 min. Blanks (acid mixture without
sample) were also prepared and ‘digested ’in parallel. The cooled
digested samples and blanks were transferred into cleaned, pre-
weighed polypropylene 60 mL bottles (WVR International Ltd) and
diluted with 10 mL UHP water.
The whole right kidney (0.9 –1.5 g), spleen (0.4 –1.1 g), liver
(~0.75 g) and left tibia (0.5 –0.7 g) were digested under the same
conditions as described above, but in 10 mL, 30 mL, 16 mL and 10 mL,
respectively, of 1+3 mixture of UHP nitric acid and UHP water.
Digested samples and blanks were analysed for Si and other elements/
minerals as described below (ICPOES analysis).
ICPOES analysis
Total elemental analysis was carried out by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES; Jobin-Yvon JY24;Instrument S.A., Longjumeau, France) with a V-groove nebuliser and
Scott-type double pass spray chamber and a sample ﬂow rate of
1 mL/min. Peak pro ﬁles were used as before [46,47] , using a window
size of 0.1 nm (0.05 nm either side of the peak) with 54 increments
per pro ﬁle. Analytical lines used were 251.611 nm (Si), 396.847 and
315.887 nm (Ca), 279.553 and 293.654 nm (Mg), 259.940 nm (Fe),
213.856 nm (Zn), 324.754 nm (Cu), 257.610 nm (Mn), 330.298 nm

Leeman DRE ICP (Leeman Labs Inc., Hudson, USA) at 214.91 nm as
this instrument was superior for near-UV analyses. Serum P was
analysed with a JY2000 (Jobin-Yvon). Samples were analysed with
sample-based standards prepared by diluting aliquots of the stock
element standard solutions (100 or 1000 mg/L; Merck Ltd; Sigma-
Aldrich Chemical Co.; or Leeman Labs Inc.) in pools of the different
sample types. Samples from all the animals were analysed in a single
batch.
Serum samples
Serum samples (1 mL) collected at sacri ﬁce were diluted with 4 mL
0.26% (v/v) UHP nitric acid and analysed for Si and Mn with an
integration time of 1 s per increment. Samples were further diluted (1+
9 with 0.26% nitric acid) for analysis of the other elements (Ca, Mg, Zn,
Cu and K); with an integration time of 0.5 s per increment. Serum P was
analysed by acid digestion of 1 ml of the 1+4 diluted serum with equalvolume of 1:1 mixture of concentrated UHP nitric acid and hydrogen
peroxide and then dilution with 3 ml of UHP water.
Urine samples
Fasting spot urine samples were diluted 1:10 with UHP water prior
to analysis for Si with an integration time of 0.5 s per increment.
Silicon concentrations were corrected for urinary creatinine.
Feed and drinking water
Digested samples of feeds and untreated drinking waters, collected
monthly, were analysed for Si with an integration time of 0.5 s per
increment. The feeds were also analysed for Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu,
Cr and B to con ﬁrm the manufacturer's reported values.
Tissue samples
Digested tissues (right kidney, spleen, liver and left tibia,) were
analysed for Si with an integration time of 0.5 s per increment. Copper,
Zn, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mn, Fe and P were also measured in the digested tibias

rats in the Si-deprived group were signi ﬁcantly longer compared to the rats in the Si-supplemented group ( P=0.0002 at the femur; P=0.002 at the left tibia; and P=0.0006 at the
humerus; unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test) and inversely correlated with fasting serum Si concentrations ( r=−0.53, P=0.006 for femurs; r=−0.47, P=0.016 for the left tibia; and
r=−0.52, P=0.007 for humeri). Two outliers (one in each group), with markedly higher Si concentrations ( N300 µg/L) compared to the group mean/median, are likely to represent
inadvertent contamination upon sample collection (despite the great care taken) and are shown, but were not included in the correlations. Lengths of the limb bones are also shown
for the standard rodent stock feed-fed group as a reference for normal rats.601 R. Jugdaohsingh et al. / Bone 43 (2008) 596 –606

increment.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as means±SD, unless otherwise stated.
Differences between the Si-deprived and Si-supplemented groups
were analysed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test with signi ﬁ-
cance taken as Pb0.05. Results are reported without adjustment for
multiple comparisons, but we have also reported where results would
remain signi ﬁcant with a simple and non-conservative Bonferroni
correction (i.e. P/n) where results are part of a larger group (e.g. bone
markers). Repeat measurements (RM)-ANOVA was used for assess-
ment of weekly body weights and lengths and, monthly serum CTX and
osteocalcin measurements over the study period. These wereconducted in SPSS for Windows (version 11; SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).
Results
Silicon intakes
Since there were no marked differences in intake of feed and water
at 17 and 25 weeks, the mean intakes over the two periods are given for
simplicity for each group. Thus the estimated mean±SD daily intake of
Si at 17 and 25 weeks (i.e. from feed plus water) was 0.17±0.04 mg/kg
body weight for the rats in the Si-deprived group and 4.08±0.74 mg/kg
body wt in the supplemented group. Dietary silicon intake in the
Si-supplemented animals was thus 24 times that of the Si-deprived
group.
In the standard rodent stock feed-fed reference group, estimated
daily Si intake was 18.51±0.65 mg/kg body weight. Again, as pre-viously stated, due to other nutritional differences (see Table 1 ), the
two diets were not compared in this study with regards to the effect of
silicon on the rats. Rats on the standard rodent stock feed served only
as a reference for normal anthropogenic measures.
Tissue Si measurements
Following 26 weeks of dietary intervention, we compared Si
concentrations of the serum, urine, tibia and soft tissues (liver, kidney
and spleen) between animals on the Si-deprived diet and those on the
same, but Si-supplemented, diet (via their drinking water). Serum
concentrations of Si (78±77 µg Si/L in the Si-deprived vs. 142±116 µgSi/L Si-supplemented group), and especially urinary concentrations of
Si (0.171±0.09 mg Si/mmol creatinine in the Si-deprived vs. 1.79±
1.28 mg Si/mmol creatinine in the Si-supplemented group), differed
signiﬁcantly between the two groups ( P=0.029 and P=0.0038,
respectively; Figs. 1 A and B). Tissue concentrations, however, were
the same ( Figs. 1 C and D; liver is shown as representative for soft
tissues; 0.55±0.53 µg Si/g vs. 0.50±0.47 µg Si/g in the Si-deprived vs.
Si-supplemented group). We also undertook Si analyses of the tissues
and bio- ﬂuids from the reference group of rats ingesting standard
rodent stock feed and tap water for the same period. Silicon concen-
trations in serum (170±79 µg Si/L), urine (1.39±0.31 mg Si/mmol
creatinine) and liver (0.91±0.73 µg Si/g) were similar between the
reference and Si-supplemented groups, but Si concentrations in bone
(tibia) were much higher in the reference group (18.4±3.7 µg Si/g
compared with 4.7±4.7 µg Si/g and 3.5±1.2 µg Si/g in the Si-deprived
and Si-supplemented groups, respectively; Pb0.0001; Fig. 1 C). There
were some other marked nutritional differences including Si content
(2–200-fold) between the standard rodent stock feed and the
formulated low-Si diet ( Table 1 ; e.g. vitamins K, B2, B3, and B5 and
minerals including cobalt, magnesium, iron and zinc) that restricted
our further comparisons to the Si-deprived versus the Si-
Fig. 4. Growth plate of the right tibia (A) and higher magni ﬁcation images in the Si-deprived (B1 and B2), Si-supplemented (C1 and C2) and standard rodent stock feed-fed (D1 and
D2) groups. Growth plates from two animals (1 and 2) are shown as representative for each group. Growth plate thickness was reduced, while chondrocyte cell density appears to be
slightly increased in the Si-deprived group (B1 and B2) compared to the Si-supplemented and standard rodent stock feed-fed reference groups.602 R. Jugdaohsingh et al. / Bone 43 (2008) 596 –606
supplemented groups, where the only difference was the addition of
orthosilicic acid to the drinking water of the latter group. Data are
however reported for the reference group of animals (see tables and
ﬁgures).
Bone measurements
Fasting serum concentrations of bone-associated elements (Ca, Mg,
K, Zn, Cu and Mn) were not different between the two groups
(Table 2 ). Serum P was lower in the Si-deprived group (242±19 mg P/L
vs. 295±33 mg P/L in the Si-supplemented group) but this was not
statistically signi ﬁcant ( P=0.134). Similarly, elemental tibia concen-
trations did not differ ( Table 3 ), except for total phosphorus which was
signiﬁcantly lower in the Si-deprived group (105±2 mg P/g vs. 117±
3 mg P/g in the Si-supplemented group; Pb0.001; Table 3 ) even when
allowing for multiple testing. Thus the Ca:P ratio in the Si-deprived
group was 1.84:1 compared to 1.62:1 in the Si-supplemented group
(P=0.0003). Both tibia phosphorus and tibia Ca:P ratio correlated with
fasting serum Si concentrations at necropsy ( r=0.45, P=0.022 and r=
−0.42, P=0.031). Body weights did not differ between the two groups
throughout the study period (339±41 g in the Si-deprived vs. 338±
39 g in the Si-supplemented group at the end of the study, at 26 wk;
Fig. 2 ), but body lengths were greater for the Si-deprived animals from
week 18 until the end of the study ( P≤0.046→Pb0.01; 45±1 cm vs. 43±
2 cm in the Si-supplemented group at the end of the study, at 26 wk).
Moreover, at necropsy, this difference was re ﬂected in all bone lengths
studied (femur, tibia and humerus), with longer bones in the Si-deprivedanimals (3.80±0.08 cm, 4.04±0.07 cm and 2.91±0.06 cm, respectively
for the femur, tibia and humeri in the Si-deprived group vs. 3.67±
0.08 cm, 3.93±0.01 cm and 2.82±0.07 cm in the Si-supplemented
group; Fig. 3 ;a l lP≤0.002), again signi ﬁcantly so even when allowing for
multiple testing. Interestingly, both body length and bone lengths
correlated inversely with fasting serum Si concentrations at necropsy
(body length: r=−0.62 and P=0.006; bone lengths: all r=−0.5 and
Pb0.02, Fig. 3 ). Examination of the growth plates indicated a decrease in
growth plate thickness, while chondrocyte density appeared to be
increased in the Si-deprived animals compared to the supplemented
group although this was not formally quanti ﬁed (Fig. 4 ).

groups (Si-deprived vs. Si-supplemented; unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test). BMDs
are also shown for the standard rodent stock feed-fed group as a reference for normalrats (hollow dash bars).Table 4Bone remodelling markers in the Si-deprived, Si-supplemented and reference group ofanimals

However, in spite of the above differences, extensive measures of
bone quality (BMD, bone markers, mechanical testing and histomor-
phometric analyses) revealed no differences between the groups at
necropsy ( Fig. 5 and Tables 4 and 5 ). The only possible difference at
necropsy was for serum CTx ( Fig. 6 A), being apparently lower in the Si-
supplemented group (15±4 ng/mL vs. 23±13 ng/mL in the Si-depleted
group; P=0.04), but when allowing for multiple testing (i.e. multiple
comparisons of bone markers) or when following the monthly
changes in CTx over the course of the study from tail vein sampling
(Fig. 6 B), this difference did not persist. Finally, when examining the
values (means±SD) for some measures of bone quality in the standard
rodent stock feed-fed reference group, it was apparent that, without
formal analyses, some would differ markedly from those of animals
receiving the formulated diet (e.g., iPTH, bone formation rate, tra-
becular separation and BMD).
Discussion and conclusions
Ourﬁndings illustrate several important issues.
(1) Selective Si deprivation led to a minor drop in serum Si
concentrations but a marked fall in urinary Si output ( Fig. 1 ).
The current paradigm is that orthosilicic acid [Si(OH) 4]–a small
soluble, labile (i.e. weak or negligible interactions with proteins
and other biomolecules) and neutral species –follows the
water pool and thus, following absorption, is excreted in linewith renal ﬁltration [4,48,49] without either active excretion orretention. In the reference group of standard rodent stock feed-
fed animals the ratio of urinary Si (creatinine corrected):serum
Si concentrations was 11±6, and similar to that of the Si-
supplemented group of 20±14. However, in the Si-deprived
animals the ratio was 3±3. This suggests that, in states of Si
deprivation, urinary Si conservation, perhaps through renal
reabsorption, canoccur. The kidneys from these two groups of
rats are being investigated by gene array and subtractive
hybridisation, aiming to identify the ﬁrst mammalian Si-
responsive genes/silicate transporters. Silicon transporters
have been identi ﬁed in diatoms [50] and in the rice plant
[51–53], but non so far in mammals. In addition we are
investigating differences in aquaporin (AQP) expression in the
kidney RNA samples, as the rice Si transporter (Lsi1; [52,53] )
shows some similarities (homology) with mammalian kidney
AQPs. One or more AQPs may be differentially expressed in the
kidneys of the Si-deprived group, suggesting potential Si
transport (i.e. the reabsorption of Si from urine), explaining
ourﬁnding of urinary Si conservation in this group. It may also
provide the basis of a test for the assessment of Si status.
(2) The ﬁnding that Si supplementation of drinking water did not
change bone Si concentrations is instructive. Despite increasing
dietary Si intakes by 24-fold throughout the study, there was no
incorporation into bone above that achieved in the baseline Si-
deprived group ( Fig.1 C), and concentrations were ﬁve fold lower
than those of the standard rodent stock feed-fed reference group.
Comparison of urinary concentrations indicated that Si uptake
into the circulation was effective in the Si-supplemented group
and comparable to that of the standard rodent stock feed-fed
reference group ( Fig.1 B). Thus, the lack of incorporation into bone
(Fig. 1 C) was not a failure of absorption but, rather, one of
utilisation. This may suggest that some co-factor, probably
nutritional, is required for maximal Si uptake into bone and
that this co-factor was absent for animals on the formulated low-
Si feed. Indeed, the signi ﬁcantly reduced (or sub-optimal) body
weight and BMD of rats on the formulated feed, compared to
standard rodent stock feed-fed rats ( Fig. 2 ), does suggest that the
different nutritional contents of these feeds translate to physio-
logical effects. Byconsidering the differences between these feeds
it may be possible to identify dietary component(s) that facilitateSi entry into bone. Major differences in the two diets were in
vitamins K, B2, B3, B5 and minerals including cobalt, magnesium,
iron and zinc. Vitamin K, although adequate in the diets, was 15-
times lower in the formulated low-Si feed. Vitamin K is important
for bone health as a co-factor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin,
the most abundant non-collagenous protein in bone [54,55] .
Osteocalcin is involved in bone mineralisation, but exact
mechanisms are not known. Vitamin K de ﬁciency results in
an increase in undercarboxylated osteocalcin and increased
bone loss, low bone mineral density and increased fractures
[54]. van Summersen [55], recently reported that a better
vitamin K status was associated with more pronounced
increase in BMD in young children. Thus there is suggestion
that vitamin K status may in
ﬂuence bone mineralisation and
BMD, which could in ﬂuence the incorporation of minerals
including Si into bone. Serum osteocalcin, but not under-
carboxylated osteocalcin, was measured in the three groups
and although no difference was found between the groups,
undercarboxylated osteocalcin is the marker of vitamin K
status [54,55] . Interestingly, however, fasting serum and bone
(tibia) elements were not different (except for Si) in the rats on
the two diets, suggesting the missing co-factor was speci ﬁct o
Si incorporation and not to other elements/minerals.
(3) Despite Si supplementation having no effect on bone Si con-
centrations or on multiple markers of bone quality when using
the specially formulated low-Si feed, we did observe effects on
Fig. 6. Serum CTx measured at necropsy (A) in the Si-deprived ( n=20 rats), Si-
supplemented ( n=10) and standard rodent stock feed-fed reference ( n=10) groups.
Serum CTx was signi ﬁcantly lower ( P=0.04; unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test) in the
Si-supplemented group compared to the Si-deprived group. However, there was nosigniﬁcant difference between the two groups (Si-deprived (squares) and Si-
supplemented (circles)) in the monthly samples collected during the study (B). Mean
monthly serum CTx is also shown for the standard rodent stock feed-fed group as a
reference for normal rats (dotted line).604 R. Jugdaohsingh et al. / Bone 43 (2008) 596 –606
certain other outcomes. Even with robust adjustment for
multiple comparisons where appropriate, there were clear
differences in (a) the phosphorus content of bone (b) the length
of the animals from week 18 onwards, and (c) the length of the
bones at necropsy, with an apparent reduction in growth plate
thickness and an increase in chondrocyte density. These data
may indicate that while circulating Si can in ﬂuence chondro-
cyte function directly (c.f. correlations between bone lengths
and serum Si; Fig. 3 ), effects on osteoblast function and/or bone
quality may require the incorporation of Si into bone.
Previous studies have reported that Si supplementation marginally
increases Ca and P in calves [21] and in the tibia of quails
supplemented with Si [40,56] . The increased serum P in the Si-
supplemented rats, compared to Si-depleted rats, suggests that Si
increases the availability and utilisation (incorporation into bone) of
dietary P [40]. Feed intake in Si-supplemented rats was lower than Si-
depleted rats (49.2±2.0 g/kg body weight versus 52.6±1.8 g/kg body;
P=0.015); water intake was not different 73.7±6.1 g/kg body weight
versus 72.5±2.6 g/kg body weight ( P=0.75).
Interestingly the effects that we observed at the chondrocyte-
dominated growth plate have resonances with estrogen-de ﬁcient
states. Estrogen de ﬁciency in men, either through aromatase
deﬁciency [57] or estrogen receptor defects [58], leads to a failure to
close the growth plate and accelerated longitudinal and radial bone
growth leading to longer bones. In rats, however, the growth plate
never closes so the effects of estrogen are more dif ﬁcult to determine
although estrogen clearly plays a role in longitudinal growth. In the
current study the thinner growth plate in the Si-depleted rats may be
similar to the effect of estrogen. Although at necropsy total serum
estradiol concentrations were not different between the two groups
(Fig. 7 ) nor was there any association between serum estradiol and
bone length, body length, serum Si or the other measures collected
(data not shown). It may be that the expression of the estrogen
receptors would have been a more appropriate measure [59,60] , but
this was not assessed here. Radial measurement of the femurs and
serum IGF-1 tended to be higher in the Si-deprived rats, but this did
not reach statistical signi ﬁcance ( P=0.28 and P=0.09, respectively;
data not shown). Moreover, we have some evidence for a Si-estradiol
interaction both in vitro (Jugdaohsingh and Powell unpublished
observations) and in vivo where epidemiological studies have shown
a positive association between dietary Si intake and bone mineral
density; strongly so in pre-menopausal women, less so in men and not
at all in post-menopausal women [18]. These results, in pre- and post-
menopausal were recently replicated in a UK (women-only) cohort[16]. We showed a strong association in pre-menopausal women, a
decrease in the association when peri-menopausal women were
included and no association in post-menopausal women. In addition
we showed that the positive association (correlation) between Si
intake and BMD is restored in post-menopausal women taking
hormone replacement therapy [16]. Associations were strongest in
current HRT users and slightly less, but still signi ﬁcant, in past users of
HRT. Whether Si is required for the effective bone activity of estradiol
(orvice versa ) and how it modi ﬁes growth plate dynamics (cell
proliferation, cell hypertrophy) should be addressed in further studies.
This study is the ﬁrst to report this in vivo effect of Si (i.e. on
longitudinal growth), despite apparent severe Si de ﬁciency in the
original studies by Carlisle [10] and by Schwarz and Milne [11].
However in these earlier investigations immature male Leghorn
cockerels [10] or male Fisher 344 rats [11] were used and, more
importantly, the studies were short term (3 –5 weeks); our data
suggest that such differences in bone length and thus body lengths
would begin at puberty (~12 weeks in the rat; Fig. 3 ). Although, female
rats were used here, we hypothesis that similar results would have
been obtained in male rats, although the magnitude of the differences
may have be less based on our epidemiological ﬁndings [18].
In conclusion, as with many studies since the 1970s, we were
unable to reproduce the profound Si de ﬁciency state reported in rats
by Schwarz and Milne [11], and in chickens by Carlisle [10].W e
presume that either our dietary Si levels were still too high in the Si-
deprived formulated diet, or that these older studies were observing
some co-de ﬁciency with their diets, or that our diet produced some
co-de ﬁciency that did not allow Si incorporation into bone. It is also
possible that our animals were pre-loaded with Si perinatally, prior to
transfer to the low-Si diet at three weeks of age. Indeed, Schwarz and
Milne [11] removed the normal chow pellets from the nursing
mothers (17th day post-partum) to minimise Si exposure to the
pups. Carlisle [10] used chicks so that the low-Si diet could be fed at a
very early age and, additionally, their yolk sacs were removed (i.e. the
chicks were deutectomised), again to minimise maternal Si transfer. In
further work, the use of second-generation offspring from Si-deprived
mothers may help to reduce body stores of Si.
We cannot explain why the supplemental Si failed to replete bone
Si levels to those observed in the reference group of animals on a
standard rodent stock diet or, indeed, at least beyond those observedin the Si-deprived group ( Fig. 1 ). Apart from the possible absence of an
essential dietary co-factor as noted above, it is also possible that our
Si-supplemented group received too little Si to detect a difference
compared to the Si-deprived animals. Thus Schwarz and Milne [11]
supplemented their rats with 500 µg Si/g diet and noted that lower
levels of supplementation gave lesser and statistically insigni ﬁcant
results: they wrote, “…it seems that relative to other trace elements,
the amount of Si needed to be quite large ….”[11]. Carlisle [10]
supplemented the chick diet with 100 µg Si/g diet, which is a similar
level to that of standard rodent stock feed. Our rats received 53 µg Si/g
in their drinking water.
However, in the last twenty years, some, but not all, studies have at
least reported quantitative changes to bone markers in Si-deprivation
animals, if not profound changes in bone and connective tissue health
(reviewed by Sripanyakorn et al. [48]). No consistent pattern has
emerged to suggest that any one marker or pattern of markers is
always in ﬂ
uenced by Si status, although markers of collagen turnover
do tend to be the most often affected [48]. As we did not show a
reduction in bone Si in the deprived group, a corresponding reduction
on bone quality, including markers of collagen turnover, is unsurpris-
ing. Nonetheless, the observations on urinary conservation of Si and
changes to bone/body length, growth plate and bone-phosphorus
concentrations are signi ﬁcant, novel and deserve further study. These
ﬁndings, as well as the hypothesis that some co-factor is required for
efﬁcient Si uptake into bone, may throw light on the elusive biological
role of Si.

supplemented; unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test), nor was there any association
with the other measures collected (serum Si, bone length, body length, etc.).605 R. Jugdaohsingh et al. / Bone 43 (2008) 596 –606
