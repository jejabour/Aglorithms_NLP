Unloading
Hindlimb suspensionSpace ﬂightBone loss associated with microgravity unloading is well documented; however, the effects of space ﬂight-relevant
types and doses of radiation on the skeletal system are not well de ﬁned. In addition, the combined effect of
unloading and radiation has not received much attention. I n the present study, we investigated the effect of proton
irradiation followed by mechanical unloading via hindlimb suspension (HLS) in mice. Sixteen-week-old female
C57BL/6 mice were either exposed to 1 Gy of protons or a sham irradiation procedure (n=30/group). One day
later, half of the mice in each group were subjected to four weeks of HLS or normal loading conditions. Radiationtreatment alone (IRR) resulted in approximately 20% loss of trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the tibiaand femur, with no effect in the cortical bone compartment. Conversely, unloading induced substantially greater
loss of both trabecular bone (60 –70% loss of BV/TV) and cortical bone (approximately 20% loss of cortical bone
volume) in both the tibia and femur, with corresponding decreases in cortical bone strength. Histological analysesand serum chemistry data demonstrated increased levels of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in unloaded
mice, but not IRR. HLS+IRR mice generally experienced greater loss of trabecular bone volume fraction, connec-
tivity density, and trabecular number than either unl oading or irradiation alone. Although the duration of
unloading may have masked certain effects, the skeletal response to irradiation and unloading appears to be addi-
tive for certain parameters. Appropriate modeling of the environmental challenges of long duration space ﬂight will
allow for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating space ﬂight-associated bone loss and for
the development of effective countermeasures.

1. Introduction
Astronauts on missions beyond Earth's orbit will be required to
live and work in a microgravity environment for long periods of
time. The response of the skeletal system to mechanical unloading
has been studied in astronauts after four to six month missions on
the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. Skeletal deterioration has
been documented in these individuals in areas that are prone to
fracture, including the vertebrae and hip. Bone loss observed in thispopulation translated into reductions in estimated bone strength in-
dices [1], suggesting that astronauts could be at a higher risk for frac-
ture during or after extended missions. For ground-based modeling,hindlimb suspension (HLS) is a widely accepted rodent model that
is able to simulate the mechanical unloading and cephalic- ﬂuid shifts
encountered in microgravity [2]. After two to three weeks of HLS,
skeletally mature mice experience reductions in bone volume fraction
in the distal femur on the order of what a human would expect to lose
following four to six months of space ﬂight[3,4].
During extended missions, astronauts will also be exposed to both
solar and cosmic radiation. Due to the shielding effect of the Earth's
magnetosphere, the type and dose of radiation encountered will besigniﬁcantly different than those experienced on the ISS, which is
located in low Earth orbit [5]. Multiple space ﬂight-relevant types of
radiation have been documented as having negative effects on trabec-
ular bone [6]. For Mars missions, cosmic rays (containing heavy ions
and protons) and solar particle events (SPEs; composed mainly of
protons) are the primary concern for radiation exposure [7–9]. SPEs
occur randomly and can deliver a relatively high dose (up to 2 Gy)
over a short period of time [8,10,11] . As a basis for comparison,Bone 51 (2012) 756 –764

2 Gy is equal to a single radiation fraction commonly administered to
a patient undergoing radiotherapy for a solid tumor [12]. Although
spacecraft shielding can effectively reduce radiation exposure, the
warning provided by current surveillance mechanisms may not
allow for complete protection during extravehicular activities [13].
Even if astronauts were sheltered behind a mass of 5 g/cm2(e.g.,
1.9 cm of aluminum or 5 cm of water), severe SPEs, such as those ob-served in August 1972 and October 1989, could deliver whole-body
radiation doses approaching 2 Gy [14]. Given the duration of future
missions planned by NASA to nearby asteroids and Mars [15],a
dose of approximately 1 Gy proton radiation is a realistic possibility
and should be used to develop mission-safety protocols [16–18].
Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated signi ﬁcant,
long-term loss of trabecular microstructure at multiple sites following
doses as low as 1 Gy protons [19] or 2 Gy X-rays [20].
While bone loss associated with unloading has been well character-
ized, the effects of radiation on the skeletal system are not as well
deﬁned. Furthermore, there are few published reports detailing the
effects of both radiation exposure and unloading on bone, although
emerging evidence suggests that these two factors may interact to re-
sult in increased bone loss. In a study by Yumoto and colleagues, irradi-
ation of skeletally mature mice following a short period of HLS was
shown to result in greater suppression of osteoblast-mediated bone for-
mation than either treatment alone [21]. Finite element computer
modeling predicted increased loss of skeletal integrity and strength in
the lumbar vertebrae of irradiated animals subjected to musculoskeletal
disuse [22]. An understanding of how the combination of these factors
affects the skeletal system is necessary to facilitate appropriate planning
for long-duration missions. In addition, the development of effective
countermeasures will require an understanding of what factors make
meaningful contributions to skeletal deterioration in space. In pursuit
of this end, the present study aims to utilize proton irradiation followed
by unloading via HLS to investigate the combined effects of these
modeled aspects of the space ﬂight environment. Protons are a low
linear energy transfer (LET) type of radiation, meaning that they tend
to penetrate deeper in to tissue and deposit less energy compared to
high LET types of radiation, such as larger carbon or iron particles
[12,23] . Previous studies have not investigated the effect of low LET
radiation and unloading [22]. It is hypothesized that the combination
of radiation and unloading will lead to greater bone loss than will eitherchallenge separately.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Farms; Germantown, NY) were
shipped to the Loma Linda University Medical Center (Loma Linda,
CA) at ﬁfteen weeks of age and acclimatized for 1 week under stan-
dard vivarium conditions. Animals were grouped by mass (5 groups,
n=15 –17/group). A detailed description of the treatment groups is
presented in Table 1 . All mice were provided with standard laborato-
ry rodent chow and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were ap-
proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at both
Loma Linda University and Clemson University (Clemson, SC).2.2. Irradiation
Two groups of animals were irradiated (IRR), while the remaining
experimental animals were subjected to a sham irradiation procedure
(i.e., non-irradiated controls; NR). A separate group of baseline mice
were killed at the start of the study and were not subjected to any
of these procedures. Immediately prior to irradiation, each mouse(test and sham-irradiated) was placed individually into a rectangular
plastic box (30×30×85 mm) with air holes, as described previously
[24]. A maximum of 6 mice were irradiated simultaneously within a
20×20 cm ﬁeld. Whole-body irradiation was performed using
250 MeV protons from the synchrotron accelerator housed at the
Loma Linda University Medical Center, as described previously
[24,25] . Mice were irradiated at the entrance region of the Bragg
curve, receiving a total dose of 1 Gy over approximately 100 s. Mini-
mizing time between radiation and unloading was a consideration in
selecting this dose rate, as was access to the synchrotron facility.
100 s was a compromise allowing for ef ﬁcient delivery of radiation
to many mice over a reasonable period of time. Mice were irradiated
behind a 400×400 mm
2polystyrene phantom in order to harden the
proton beam (i.e., remove low-energy particles) and allow a uniform
dose to be administered throughout the entire mouse. Dose calibration
was performed using a Markus parallel plate ionization chamber
(National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable). The calibra-
tion method in the International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements Report 59 [26]was used to convert the ionization signal
to dose in water. The sham treatment involved identical handling, pro-
cedures, and timing as the irradiation group, although the beam was not
turned on. After the mice were subjected to the irradiation or sham pro-
cedure, they were observed until they resumed normal posture and
behavior. All mice were then shipped overnight to Clemson University
and immediately subjected to hindlimb unloading as described below
(approximately 30 –33 h after irradiation). One day after arrival, the
baseline control group (BSL) was killed and tissues were collected
(see the “Study endpoint ”section for details).
2.3. Hindlimb suspension
One day after the irradiation or sham procedure, one half of the
IRR mice and one half of the NR mice were subject to hindlimb sus-
pension (HLS). The remaining mice were kept as normally loaded
controls (LC). This allocation produced the following ﬁve groups:
baseline (BSL), non-irradiated and normally loaded (NR+LC), irradiated
and normally loaded (IRR+LC), non-irradiated and hindlimb suspen-
sion (NR+HLS), and irradiated and hindlimb suspension (IRR+HLS)
(Table 1 ).
HLS was performed using a modi ﬁcation of the Morey-Holton
method, as described previously [2]. Mice were suspended at an ap-
proximately 30° angle using a custom-built tail harness consisting of
a 3×25×30 mm section of Akton® viscoelastic polymer padding
(Action Products; Hagerstown, MD) surrounded by a 30 mm section
of Tygon R-3603 plastic tubing with an 8 mm internal diameter
(Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics; Northboro, Massachusetts). The
tail harness was attached via steel wire to a swivel clip mounted on
a guide wire running the length of the cage. Using this setup, mice
were able to access all areas of the cage.
2.4. Study endpoint
At the end of the four-week experimental period, all mice were anes-
thetized with inhalation iso ﬂurane (2%) and killed by exsanguination via
cardiac puncture followed by cervical dislocation. Hindlimbs were re-
moved and both tibias and femurs were cleaned of all nonosseous tissue.
The left femur of each animal, required for mechanical testing and com-
positional analysis, was allowed to air-dry for 48 h [27].T h er i g h tf e m u rTable 1

and tibia were ﬁxed in a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 48 h,
rinsed with distilled water, and stored in 70% ethanol.
2.5. Serum analyses
At sacri ﬁce, samples of whole blood were collected by cardiac
puncture. Blood was allowed to clot for 30 min. Serum was then sep-
arated via centrifugation at 1500 gfor 10 min. Markers of bone turn-
over present in the serum were measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for the bone formation marker
osteocalcin (BT-470, Biomedical Technologies, Inc.; Stoughton, MA)
and the bone resorption marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
5b (TRAP5b) (SB-TR103, Immunodiagnostic Systems Inc.; Fountain
Hills, AZ). All ELISA procedures were performed according to the
manufacturers' protocols.
2.6. Bone microarchitectural analyses
Cortical and trabecular bone architecture was analyzed using
microcomputed tomography ( μCT80, Scanco Medical; Brüttisellen,
Switzerland) with an isotropic voxel size of 10 μm. Trabecular
microarchitecture was scanned immediately distal to the growth
plate in the proximal tibia as well as immediately proximal to the
growth plate in the distal femur. Analysis of trabecular bone was
performed on 100 slices (1.0 mm total), producing images for analy-
sis. Bone morphometric parameters were then quanti ﬁed using
Scanco software. Trabecular bone parameters included: trabecular
bone volume fraction (BV/TV), connectivity density (Conn.D), trabec-
ular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and structural
model index (SMI). Cortical analysis was performed immediately dis-
tal to the region of trabecular analysis in the tibia and immediately
proximal to the region of trabecular analysis in the femur with 30
slices (0.3 mm) selected at each site. Cortical bone volume (Ct.BV),
cortical total volume (Ct.TV), cortical porosity (Ct.Po), and polar
moment of inertia (pMOI) were calculated from these sections.
2.7. Mechanical testing
In order simulate in vivo properties, the air-dried left femurs were
rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 90 min prior to evalua-
tion[27]. Three-point bending tests were performed using an Instron
5582 (BlueHill 2 software, Instron Corp.; Norwood, MA). Femurs were
tested to failure with a 9 mm span length and a de ﬂection rate of
5 mm/min. All bones were tested in the same orientation: the
single-point load was applied mid-diaphysis on the posterior surface.
The maximal force (N) and de ﬂection (mm) were measured for all
mechanically tested bones. These two properties were also deter-
mined at the elastic limit (P e,δe) and the failure point. The 0.2% offset
method was used to quantify yield properties. The ability of the femur
to resist displacement (i.e., stiffness; N/mm) was calculated from
elastic force/elastic de ﬂection (P e/δe).
2.8. Bone mineral composition
Mineral-content analysis was performed on femurs fractured
during mechanical testing. Prior to analysis, the enlarged ends of
the femurs (epiphysis+metaphysis) were separated where distal
and proximal metaphyses join the diaphysis. Mineral content data
was obtained from these combined bone ends and also separately
for the diaphysis. A properly calibrated analytical scale (Mettler Toledo
UMT2; Columbus, OH) was used for all measurements. Dry mass
(DryM) was measured after heating the bones to 105 °C for 24 h. Min-
eral mass (MinM) was measured after the bones had been heated at
800 °C for an additional 24 h. Percent mineralization was calculated
as: %Min=(MinM)/(DryM) *100.2.9. Histology
In order to examine the post-irradiation activity of bone-resorbing
osteoclasts, right tibias from a subset of mice (n=6/group) were se-
lected for histological analyses. After ﬁxation, tibias were decalci ﬁed
in a weak formic acid solution (Immunocal ™, Decal Chemical Corpo-
ration; Tallman, NY) for 2 days. Radiographs assessed the earliesttime point of complete decalci ﬁcation. Following this, tibias were em-
bedded in a glycol methacrylate resin (Immunobed ™, Polysciences;
Warrington, PA) and cut into sagittal sections with a thickness of
1.5μm. Osteoclast presence was determined by TRAP staining of the
slides using a commercially available kit (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) and
then counterstaining with hematoxylin (Sigma). Only TRAP-positive
cells with two or more nuclei were counted as osteoclasts. Two sec-
tions from each bone were analyzed.
Analyses were performed using SigmaScan Pro Software (Systat
Software, Inc., Richmond, CA). The evaluator was blinded to specimen
origin and group assignment until after evaluation and analysis was
complete. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed from captured
micrographs (400×) throughout the metaphysis, starting approximately
0.25 mm distal from the growth plate (in order to exclude the primary
spongiosa) and extending a further 0.5 mm. Bone histomorphometric
parameters for the proximal metaphysis of the tibia were measured
a n dr e p o r t e di nu n i t ss p e c i ﬁed by the American Society for Bone
and Mineral Research Histomophometry Nomenclature Committee
[28]. All surface measurements were quanti ﬁed relative to total bone
surface (BS). Histological measurem ents included osteoclast surface
(Oc.S/BS; %); eroded surface with the inclusion of osteoclast surface
(surface covered by Howship's lacuna e plus osteoclasts, [ES(Oc+)/BS],
%); and eroded surface with the exclusion of osteoclast surface (surface
covered by Howship's lacunae, [ES(Oc −)/BS], %). The number of osteo-
clasts (N.Oc) within the region of interest along trabeculae of the second-
ary spongiosa was also determined (N.Oc/BS, mm
−1).
2.10. Statistics
Statistical analysis of the experimental results was completed
using SigmaStat software v3.5 (Systat Software Inc.; San Jose, CA).
Comparisons were made using a two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Unless otherwise noted, no statistical interaction was pres-
ent. Where signi ﬁcance was present overall for a treatment condition,
a Student Newman –Keuls test was performed to reveal signi ﬁcance
between speci ﬁc groups (e.g., radiation within HLS, radiation within
LC, or loading condition within NR). Statistical signi ﬁcance was set
at Pb0.05 for all comparisons. Data are shown as mean±standard
error (SE), unless otherwise indicated.
3. Results
3.1. Animal mass
Mean animal mass at sacri ﬁce for each group was as follows: BSL=
22.4±0.27 g, NR+LC=23.2±0.32 g, IRR+LC=23.3±0.38 g, NR+
HLS=22.6±0.30 g, and IRR+HLS=22.4±0.30 g. There was no sig-
niﬁcant effect of irradiation on animal mass. Overall, HLS mice were
3–4% lighter than LC mice. However, these differences were not signi ﬁ-
cant when comparing individual groups (i.e., NR+HLS versus NR+LC
and IRR+HLS versus IRR+LC).
3.2. Baseline microarchitectural parameters
Compared to 20 week-old NR+LC, 16-week-old baseline mice
(BSL) had higher trabecular BV/TV as well as higher overall trabecular
bone quality in both the proximal tibia ( Fig. 1 ) and the distal femur
(Fig. 2 ), as represented by higher trabecular bone parameters includ-
ing Conn.D, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, and SMI.758 S.A. Lloyd et al. / Bone 51 (2012) 756 –764
3.3. Effects of irradiation on normally loaded mice
Compared to NR+LC, IRR+LC mice experienced signi ﬁcant dete-
rioration of trabecular microarchitectural parameters. In the proximal
tibia, IRR+LC mice had signi ﬁcantly lower BV/TV ( −16%), Conn.D
(−28%), and Tb.N ( −7.7%) and signi ﬁcantly higher Tb.Sp (+9.0%)
and SMI (+11%) ( Fig. 1 ). In the distal femur, IRR+LC had signi ﬁcant-
ly lower BV/TV ( −22%) and Conn.D ( −37%) and higher SMI (+8.0%)
(Fig. 2 ). Tb.N and Tb.Sp were unchanged.
In both the tibia and femur, cortical bone parameters, including
Ct.TV, Ct.BV, Ct.Po, and pMOI were not different between IRR+LC
and NR+LC ( Table 2 ). Similarly, femurs from IRR+LC mice did not
have signi ﬁcantly different mechanical strength or any mechanical
parameters assessed when compared to NR+LC ( Fig. 3 ).
Percent mineralization in the femur was not signi ﬁcantly different
between IRR+LC and NR+LC ( Fig. 4 ). Serum markers of bone
turnover, including osteocalcin and TRAP5b, were also not different
between IRR+LC and NR+LC ( Table 3 ). In addition, histological pa-
rameters, including ES(Oc+)/BS, ES(Oc −)/BS, Oc.S/BS, and N.Oc/BS,
were not signi ﬁcantly different between IRR+LC and NR+LC mice
(Table 3 ).
3.4. Effect of unloading on non-irradiated mice
Compared to NR+LC, NR+HLS mice experienced substantial de-
terioration of trabecular bone. At the proximal tibia, NR+HLS mice
were found to have signi ﬁcantly lower trabecular BV/TV ( −74%),
Conn.D ( −86%), Tb.N ( −22%), and higher Tb.Sp (+29%) and SMI
(+45%) ( Fig. 1 ). There were similar ﬁndings in the trabecular boneof the distal femur, where NR+HLS mice had signi ﬁcantly lower
BV/TV (−60%), Conn.D ( −75%), and Tb.N ( −12%) and higher Tb.Sp
(+14%) and SMI (+7.3%) compared to NR+LC ( Fig. 2 ).
As opposed to irradiated mice, NR+HLS mice experienced signif-
icant loss of cortical microstructure when compared to NR+LC
(Table 2 ). In the proximal tibia, these mice had signi ﬁcantly lower
Ct.TV (−19%), Ct.BV ( −23%), and pMOI ( −18%), and higher Ct.Po
(+34%). In the distal femur, NR+HLS mice had signi ﬁcantly lower
Ct.TV (−21%), Ct.BV ( −24%), pMOI ( −21%), and higher Ct.Po
(+33%) versus NR+LC. NR+HLS mice also had reduced mechanical
competency compared to NR+LC, with signi ﬁcantly reductions in
stiffness, maximum force, and elastic force ( Fig. 3 ). Percent minerali-
zation was lower in both the epiphysis and diaphysis in NR+HLS ver-
sus NR+LC mice ( Fig. 4 ).
NR+HLS mice did not have signi ﬁcantly different levels of the
bone formation marker osteocalcin when compared to levels in
NR+LC ( Table 3 ). However, NR+HLS mice did have signi ﬁcantly
higher levels of the bone resorption marker TRAP5b when compared
to NR+LC. Histological examination of the proximal tibia did not
reveal any signi ﬁcant differences between NR+HLS and NR+LC
mice in terms of Oc.S/BS or N.Oc/BS. Overall, HLS mice had higher
ES(Oc+)/BS and ES(Oc −)/BS. However, these differences were not
signiﬁcant when individual groups were compared (i.e., NR+HLS
versus NR+LC mice).
3.5. Effect of irradiation on unloaded mice
Compared to NR+HLS, IRR+HLS mice had deteriorated trabecular
microarchitecture. In the tibia, IRR+HLS mice had signi ﬁcantly lower

Conn.D ( −38.9%) and Tb.N ( −8.0%) and signi ﬁcantly higher Tb.Sp
(+9.6%) and SMI (+9.6%) when compared to NR+HLS ( Fig. 1 ).
There was a trend of decreased BV/TV ( −17.4%; P=0.053) in IRR+HLS
mice compared to NR+HLS ( Fig. 1 ). A statistically signi ﬁcant interac-
tion between radiation and unloading was present for Conn.D in
the tibia. In the femur, IRR+HLS mice had signi ﬁcantly lower BV/TV
(−26.4%) and Conn.D ( −45.9%) and signi ﬁcantly greater SMI (+7.4%)
versus NR+HLS ( Fig. 2 ). In the femur, Tb.Sp and Tb.N were not signi ﬁ-
cantly different between IRR+HLS and NR+HLS mice. The percent
differences between irradiated and non-irradiated animals were similarfor both the LC and HLS mice for several trabecular microarchitectural
parameters in both the tibia and the femur ( Table 4 ).
In both the tibia and femur, cortical bone parameters (including
Ct.TV, Ct.BV, Ct.Po, and pMOI) were not different between IRR+HLS
and NR+HLS mice ( Table 2 ). Similarly, IRR+HLS did not have signif-
icantly different measures of mechanical strength when compared to
NR+HLS ( Fig. 3 ).
While mineral content in the diaphysis of the femur was not
signiﬁcantly different, IRR+HLS mice had lower mineral content in
the epiphysis and overall compared to NR+HLS ( Fig. 4 ). A statistically

signiﬁcant interaction between radiation and unloading was present for
mineral content in the epiphysis and total femur. Markers for bone
turnover, including osteocalcin and TRAP5b, were not signi ﬁcantly dif-
ferent between IRR+HLS and NR+HLS mice ( Table 3 ). In addition,
there was no signi ﬁcant difference in histological parameters, including
ES(Oc+)/BS, ES(Oc −)/BS, Oc.S/BS, and N.Oc/BS, when comparing
IRR+HLS and NR+HLS mice.
4. Discussion
In the present study we have con ﬁrmed that 1 Gy of whole body
proton irradiation results in signi ﬁcant loss of trabecular bone at the
proximal tibia. We have also broadened the scope of bone loss associ-
ated with irradiation by demonstrating similar and signi ﬁcant delete-
rious effects on trabecular bone mass and microarchitecture at the
distal femur. These results suggest that the effect of radiation on
bone is not speci ﬁc to one site. Previous studies from our laboratory
have demonstrated bone loss in mice four months after proton radia-
tion exposure [19]. Here, we report a similar amount of bone loss in
the tibia (~15%) just one month after irradiation. This similarity sug-
gests that the deterioration of bone resultant from 1 Gy of radiation is
persistent long after exposure.
These ﬁndings may have signi ﬁcant implications for the recovery
of astronauts following space ﬂight radiation exposure as a prolonged
period of compromised bone structure may increase the risk of frac-
ture during a mission or following return to Earth. Models predicting
recovery of skeletal sites such as the lumbar spine, pelvis, and calca-
neus following 4 –6 month missions on the ISS suggest that it would
take nine months to regain 50% of the BMD lost during space ﬂight
[29]. Indeed, direct measurements on astronauts following long dura-
tion missions have shown that proximal femur bone mineral density
(BMD) and calculated bone strength were only partially recovered a
year after return to Earth [30]. It is clear that the recovery period is
much longer than the actual period of space ﬂight exposure and, as
we have shown, exposure to types and doses of radiation found out-
side of low Earth orbit may further comprise bone structure and delay
recovery.It is important to note that the bone loss observed in the present
study occurred in skeletally mature mice. While high-linear energy
transfer (LET) space ﬂight radiation has been demonstrated to lead to
bone loss in growing mice [31], the effect of low-LET protons on bone
in skeletally mature animals has not been previously studied. Since
astronauts are themselves skeletally mature (i.e., aged 30 –50 years),
this is a critical ﬁnding. Furthermore, these results suggest that the
bone loss we observed is not likely due to changes in growth: three pre-
vious studies from our laboratory investigated the effect of low-LET pro-
ton irradiation in relatively young (8 to 9-week-old) mice [6,19,23] .
Bone loss in these studies was similar to what we observed presently.Thus, while the underlying mechanisms mediating radiation-induced
bone loss may be different between growing and mature animals, the
fact that similar bone loss occurred in these studies suggests otherwise.
Bone volume fraction and other measures of trabecular bone quality
were lower in control animals sacri ﬁced at the end of the one-month
study, compared to baseline mice. This “natural ”
bone loss is consistent
with previous investigations characterizing the decline of trabecular-
bone parameters with age [32–34]. These ﬁndings also indicate that
the lower trabecular bone quality in irradiated and hindlimb suspended
mice was not due to an inhibition of bone growth. Histological examina-
tion and measurements of serum-bone-turnover markers did not reveal
any signi ﬁcant differences following irradiation in either the loaded
control or hindlimb suspension groups. Indeed, the radiation effects
that we observed at four weeks primarily consisted of lower structural
and functional parameters, rather than an effect on osteoclast or osteo-
blast activity. These data, combined with other recent studies demon-
strating that the skeletal effects of radiation are rapid and initiated by
the activation of osteoclasts [20,35] , indicate that bone turnover likely
stabilized by the four-week post irradiation time point when these as-
says were conducted. Future studies should implement blood collection
and histological assays at multiple early time points to more completely
characterize the effects on bone turnover and cellular mediators.
A four-week period of hindlimb suspension had signi ﬁcant delete-
rious effects on trabecular bone. Unloaded, nonirradiated mice had
74% and 60% lower trabecular bone volume fraction than normally
loaded, nonirradiated mice in the tibia and femur, respectively,

which is consistent with our previous experience with this model
[36]. Given the approximate 1% loss of bone mass per month docu-
mented in astronauts on the ISS [1], it is not likely that astronauts
will encounter this degree of bone loss on a long-duration mission;
furthermore, the degree of bone loss made it more dif ﬁcult to mea-
sure further changes in certain bone parameters with the addition
of irradiation. That is, the extended period of unloading may have ef-
fectively pushed the bone loss to its physiological maximum, thus
preventing the observation of additional loss from irradiation. It is
clear that HLS represents an accelerated model of bone loss compared
to space ﬂight; however, it has been well validated and remains the
standard for ground-based modeling of microgravity unloading
[2,37,38] . Despite the reduced resolution, combined effects of irradia-
tion prior to unloading were still observed. In the tibia, reductions inconnectivity density, structural-model index, trabecular separation,
and trabecular number exhibited an additive effect when irradiation
was combined with unloading. Furthermore, there was a statistical
trend indicating additional loss of bone volume fraction in irradiated
mice subjected to unloading (P=0.053). The effects of irradiation
combined with unloading were additive for bone volume fraction,
connectivity density, and structural-model index in the femur. Per-
cent mineralization was also lower for the combination of irradiation
and unloading, compared to unloading alone. Taken together, these
ﬁndings support the conclusion that irradiation and unloading leads
to greater skeletal deterioration than unloading alone. While there
are important caveats in the translation of these ﬁndings to space-
ﬂight applications, astronauts exposed to relatively high doses of ra-
diation on missions beyond low-Earth orbit may be at risk for
higher levels of bone loss than astronauts on the International Space
Station, where the Earth's magnetic ﬁeld offers greater natural pro-
tection from radiation exposure [5].
Relevant to the interpretation of these results is the presence of
interactions between the two treatments. The only statistical inter-
actions detected between irradiation and unloading were for the
parameter of trabecular connectivity density in the tibia and mineral
content. That is, for every other measured parameter, the effect of ir-
radiation did not depend on whether the mouse was unloaded or not.
Thus, even though the effect of four weeks of unloading was large, the
effect of irradiation was statistically the same in both unloaded and
normally loaded controls. This ﬁnding is supported by comparison
of the relative effects of irradiation in normally loaded and unloaded
mice ( Table 2 ). In both the tibia and the femur, irradiation had similar
effects across several trabecular parameters, providing additional
evidence that the effect of irradiation and unloading on bone may
be additive.

Our data demonstrate that four weeks of unloading results in sub-
stantial degradation and loss of trabecular bone. To the authors'
knowledge, the greatest measured bone loss after hindlimb suspen-
sion of skeletally mature mice was 59% in BALB/c mice following
two weeks of unloading [3]. Depending on site and strain of mouse,
other studies have noted bone loss on the order of 10 –25% following
two-to-three weeks of unloading [4,39,40] . The much greater bone
loss observed in the present study suggests that bone loss is occurring
in the fourth week of unloading and thus does not appear to plateau
during this period. While a shorter period of HLS may be able to
better model the bone loss that is likely to occur in an astronaut on
a four-to-six month mission, the high degree of loss in this longer
period does raise notable questions regarding the possible degree of
bone loss in astronauts on a two-to-three year mission. Modeling
such a scenario would be further complicated by the period of
reloading that would occur while the astronauts lived and worked
on the surface of Mars, for example. Further study is needed to under-
stand the skeletal effects of various degrees of unloading, reloading,
and radiation exposure. Another important consideration in the
study design is how it corresponds to an actual space ﬂight situation.
While the use of irradiation followed by unloading is the most logis-
tically feasible study design, it is different than the scenario of an as-
tronaut being exposed to a large amount of proton radiation from a
solar particle event. In this case, astronauts would experience a po-
tentially lengthy period of skeletal unloading prior to radiation expo-
sure. Currently, it is not known how the timing of irradiation and
unloading affects the skeletal response or degree of bone loss. This
is also an area that requires further investigation.
The present study provides additional evidence to suggest that the
skeletal effects of proton radiation are speci ﬁc to the trabecular bone
compartment. As expected, we observed modest loss of cortical bone
following unloading; however, there was no effect of proton irradia-
tion alone on cortical bone. In addition, there was no additional effect
of combined irradiation and unloading on cortical microstructure
(Table 3 ). These ﬁndings are corroborated by the lack of change in
assessed mechanical strength parameters, which are highly depen-
dent on cortical bone in the three-point bending test paradigm
(Fig. 3 ). Previous work by our group has not demonstrated an effect
of proton radiation on cortical bone [6,19,23] .
It is dif ﬁcult to design an experiment that adequately mimics the
types and doses of radiation that astronauts can expect to encounter
in the space ﬂight environment. For example, while a solar particle
event has a high particle ﬂuence compared to galactic cosmic rays,
the total dose from such an event would be delivered over a period
of hours-to-days instead of minutes, as in the current study. The effect
of dose rate on the response of bone is unknown. It is known that the
effects of radiation in nonosseous tissues are dramatically dependent
on dose rate. The ability of the cell to initiate repair mechanisms is
intimately related to its ability to recover from radiation-induced
damage [12]. In general, a dose of radiation administered over a
1-minute period would produce far more damage than the same
dose and kind over a 1-hour period. Indeed, this concept of cellular
repair time (which includes DNA repair, free-radical scavenging,
and replacement of damaged macromolecules) is the basis of the
dose fractionation that guides the use of therapeutic radiation for
cancer [12]. Because astronauts would be subject to both continuous
exposure from low-dose radiation (such as that from galactic cosmic
rays) and potentially short bursts of relatively high dose proton radi-
ation (such as that from a solar particle event), it can be seen why de-
sign of adequate Earth-based models represents a logistical challenge.
In addition, previous studies from our laboratory indicate that mixed
radiation may have more of an effect on bone than a single type [31].
Thus, the effects of proton radiation on bone may be greater in the
presence of other radiation types.
The results of the present study demonstrate that a 1 Gy dose of
proton radiation has deleterious effects on trabecular bone in thetibia and femur of skeletally mature mice. Mechanical unloading
induced signi ﬁcant loss of both trabecular and cortical bone. Investi-
gation of the combined effect of proton irradiation followed by
unloading suggests an additive effect for certain parameters. Indeed,for many indices, this combination produced signi ﬁcantly greater de-
clines in bone structural properties. Statistical analysis revealed some
of the effects of radiation were largely independent of unloading,suggesting that astronauts on long duration missions beyond the
protective radiation shielding of low Earth orbit may be at greater
risk for skeletal deterioration. Of course, further study is needed to re-
ﬁne models of the space ﬂight environment (including variations in
the timing of radiation and unloading, the period of unloading, and
the dose, rate, and type of radiation) in order to better understand
the risks to skeletal health and aid in the development of effective
countermeasures.
