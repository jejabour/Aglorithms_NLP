We investigated the effects of recombinant human BMP-2
(rhBMP-2) on differentiation of cells isolated from humanbone, muscle, and skin. Cells isolated from bones of sixpatients (HBM-1 to HBM-6), muscle from five patients(HM-1 to HM-5), and skin from three patients (HF-1 toHF-3) were used. rhBMP-2 had no effects on proliferation oftwoHBMcells,buthadastimulatoryeffectonthreeHMcellsamples. rhBMP-2 stimulated both alkaline phosphatase(ALP) activity in all HBM cells and parathyroid hormone(PTH)-dependent cAMP production in three of the fourHBM cell samples, although the magnitudes of these stimu-latory effects differed among the cells tested.

Introduction
Bone has remarkable regenerative potential during repair of
fractures and skeletal defects. In cases associated with largeskeletaldefects,however,theregenerativeabilityofbonesthem-selvesisoftennotsufficientforcompleterepair.Stimulatingnewbone formation might be an important application for growthfactors. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which was firstidentified as a protein capable of inducing ectopic bone forma-tion at sites of implantation,
25is of great clinical importance to
such factors.6,14,24,32Wozney et al.28first cloned four cDNAs
encoding human BMPs (BMP-1, BMP-2A [BMP-2], BMP-3,and BMP-4 [BMP-2B]), and demonstrated that, with the excep-tion of BMP-1, they belonged to the transforming growth fac-tor-b(TGF-b) superfamily. The BMP subfamily is composed of
at least 15 molecules. Among the members of the BMP subfam-ily, recombinant proteins of several BMPs capable of inducingectopic bone formation in vivo have been successfully pro-duced.
16,19,27,28Although many experiments using these recom-
binant proteins have been conducted to explore their effects onosteoblast differentiation and bone formation,
10–12,16,19,21,23,31
most studies have been performed using lower animals or cellsderivedfromratsandmice.InformationconcerningtheeffectsofBMP on osteoblast differentiation in human cells has accumu-lated,
1,12,13,20,33but the results are confusing, because rhBMPs
exertdifferenteffectsonosteoblastdifferentiationamongthecellsamples tested.
Skeletal tissue is composed of various types of mesenchymal
cells such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, muscle cells, and bonemarrow stromal cells, including adipocytes. These cell lineagesare believed to originate from common pluripotent progenitors,known as skeletal mesenchymal stem cells.
17These progenitors
acquire specific phenotypes depending on maturation stage dur-ing the differentiation process, but the precise regulatory mech-anism that controls the differentiation process of these celllineagesisstillunclear.WeinvestigatedtherolesofBMPsinthedifferentiation of skeletal mesenchymal cells using several celllinesderivedfromratsandmice.

2.23,30In contrast to the stimulatory effects on osteoblast differ-
entiation, BMP-2 inhibited differentiation of myogenic cells intomyotubes.
11,15,29In some myogenic cells, BMP-2 converted the
differentiation pathway of the cells to the osteoblast lineage.11
Thus, the role of BMPs in the regulation of differentiationpathways of mesenchymal cells has been studied extensivelyusing cells derived from rats and mice. However, such effects ofBMPs on human mesenchymal cells have not been fully inves-tigated. More extensive basic studies using human cells arerequired so that BMP can be used appropriately for clinicalapplications.
In this study, we investigated the effects of recombinant
human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) on differentiation of cells isolatedfrom human bone, muscle, and skin using in vitro culture and invivo transplantation experiments. Our results provide importantinformation in support of clinical application of rhBMP-2 inman.
Materials and Methods
Recombinant Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2rhBMP-2 was provided by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co.
(Tokyo, Japan). This recombinant protein was produced in Chi-nese hamster ovary cells and purified as described previously.

Isolation and Culture of Cells From Human Bone, Muscle,and Skin
Small biopsy specimens (5 35 mm), obtained from iliac bones
of six patients, muscle of five patients, and skin of three patients,
were used for isolation of cells from each tissue. They wereobtained from patients not suffering from systemic dysplasia ofbones or metabolic bone diseases. All patients provided writteninformed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.The clinical features of these patients and the sites from whichthe samples were obtained are summarized in Table 1. The
patients did not suffer from specific diseases other than thoseindicated in the table.
To obtain bone-derived cells, bone samples were minced andwashed twice with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-
buffered saline [(PBS( 2)]. They were incubated for 1 h with
gentleshakinginsolutioncontaining0.1%collagenaseand0.2%dispase in PBS(2) at 37°C. This process was performed twice,and the cells thus obtained were combined and cultured sepa-rately for each case. They were designated HBM-1 to HBM-6.Muscle-derived cells were isolated by digestion of the muscle
specimens with 0.05% trypsin fo r1ha t37°C according to the
method of Blau et al.
5(designated HM-1 to HM-5). To allow
skinfibroblaststoadheretothesurfaceofculturedishes,theskinsamples were placed on the surface of 35 mm dishes for 1 hwithout supplement of culture medium at 37°C, then they wereculturedfor7dayswithsupplementofculturemedium.Theskinfibroblasts that migrated from the explants were collected bydigestion with 0.1% trypsin and 0.02% ethylene-diamine tet-raacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS( 2) (designated HF-1 to HF-3).
Thiscellpopulationcontainedfewkeratinocytesaftersubculture,as judged immunohistochemically using wide-spectrum keratin(data not shown). All experiments were performed using cellswithin three passages, and they were inoculated at a density of2310
4cells/cm2. HBM cells and HF cells were cultured with
a-minimum essential medium ( a-MEM; Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;Gibco) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mLstreptomycin). HM cells were maintained in a-MEM supple-
mentedwith15%FBSandantibiotics.Insomeexperiments,HMcells were cultured with a-MEM containing 5% FBS to induce
myogenic differentiation.
These HBM, HF, and HM cells were treated with various
concentrations of rhBMP-2 for 3 or 6 days, and the followingparameters were measured.
Measurement of Cell Proliferation
The cells were cultured for 3 days with various concentrations of
rhBMP-2, and the cell number in each well was estimated usinga cell-counting kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan).This technique employs a tetrazolium salt, WST-1, which pro-duces a highly water-soluble formazan dye.
8The relative cell
number was determined by measuring absorbance of theformazan dye product in the cultures at a wavelength of 405 nmTable 1. Clinical characteristics of the patients from whom cells were isolated and the sites from which tissues

after incubation with the reagents in the kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity
To examine ALP-positive cells histochemically, the cells were
fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin in PBS for 20 min.ALP activity in the cells was determined using naphthol AS-MXphosphate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as a substrateand fast blue BB salt (Sigma) as a coupler, as described previ-ously.
11ALP activity was also determined biochemically by an
established technique using p-nitrophenylphosphate as sub-
strate.31Protein concentration was determined using BCA pro-
tein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL).
cAMP Production in Response to PTH
Cells were preincubated for 20 min with a-MEM containing
0.5% BSA and 1 mmol/L 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After
removal of the preincubation media, cells were incubated for 8min with 200 ng/mL of human parathyroid hormone [hPTH(1-34);providedbyDr.Hori,AsahiChemicalCo.,Shizuoka,Japan]dissolvedinthesameculturemedium.ThecAMPconcentrationsin the cell layers were determined by RIA using a cAMP assaykit (Yamasa Co., Chiba, Japan).
Osteocalcin Production
The amount of osteocalcin secreted into the culture medium was
determined by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using a humanosteocalcin assay kit (Mitsubishi Yuka Co., Tsukuba, Japan).
Immunohistochemistry
Myotubes that appeared in HM cell cultures were examined
immunohistochemically for myosin heavy chain (MHC) expres-sion. To detect MHC, cells were fixed for 10 min with a coldacetone/ethanol mixture (1:1), and stained by an indirect immu-noperoxidase technique using mouse antihuman MHC monoclo-nal antibody (Nichirei Co., Tokyo). After incubation with thisantibody, the cells were incubated with biotinylated secondaryantibody against mouse IgG, then reacted with peroxidase-la-beled streptavidin (Nichirei Co.). The reaction products werevisualized using an AEC substrate kit (Nichirei Co.). The num-bers of MHC-positive myotubes were counted in 0.785 cm
2
fields in arbitrarily selected areas of each well after immunohis-tochemical staining. Double staining for ALP activity and im-munohistochemical staining for MHC was also performed. Inthis case, the cells were stained for ALP as described above justbefore development of immunohistochemical reaction productswith AEC.
Transplantation of Cells in Diffusion Chambers
Diffusion chambers containing rhBMP-2 were prepared as de-
scribed previously.
30HBM-6 or HM-4 cells (3–5 3106cells in
100mL of culture medium) were loaded into the diffusion
chambers. To allow the cells to adhere to membrane filtersprecoated with 5 mg of rhBMP-2, each diffusion chamber was
incubated for 12 h with a-MEM containing 10% FBS at 37°C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO
2in air. Diffusion chambers were
transplanted into the peritoneal cavities of 6-week-old athymicmale mice (one diffusion chamber per mouse). Three diffusionchambers coated with rhBMP-2 were transplanted for each celltype. The same number of diffusion chambers without rhBMP-2coating were also transplanted into athymic mice as controls.Seven weeks later, the diffusion chambers were removed, fixedin 10% neutral buffered formalin, and embedded in Technovit8100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Germany). Sections 4 mm thick were
prepared, and stained by the von Kossa method to visualizemineralization and with toluidine blue for identification ofcartilage.
Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as the mean 6SEM. Statistical
analysis between the two groups was evaluated by Student’s
t-test or two-way ANOVA.
Results
Characterization of Cells Isolated From Human Bone, Muscle,
and Skin
Although cells isolated from bone, muscle, and skin exhibited
various levels of ALP activity when cultured in the absencerhBMP-2,thecellsisolatedfromboneandmuscleshowedhigherALP activity than those isolated from skin (see Figure 2). Withthe exception of HF-3, PTH exposure increased intracellularcAMPlevelstovaryingdegreesinallcellsamplesexamined(seeFigure 3). No osteocalcin was produced by any of the six HBMcell samples cultured for 6 days in the absence of 1,25-(OH)
2vitamin D3. However, these cells synthesized measurable
levels of osteocalcin when cultured for the last 24 h with1,25-(OH)
2vitamin D3(see Figure 4A). None of the HM and HF
cell samples produced detectable levels of osteocalcin in thepresence or absence of 1,25-(OH)
2vitamin D3(data not shown).
A substantial number of myotubes appeared in cultures of cellsisolated from muscle (HM cells) (see Figure 5). HM cellscultured with 5% FBS generated more myotubes than thosecultured with 15% FBS.
Effects of rhBMP-2 on Cell Proliferation
Cell proliferation was examined in two samples of HBM cells
(HBM-2 and HBM-6), three of HM cells (HM-1, HM-2, andHM-5), and one of HF cells (HF-1). The cell numbers estimatedusing a cell proliferation kit increased 43% in HM cells and 21%in HBM cells during the first 3 days in culture. rhBMP-2 had noeffect on proliferation of these HBM (Figure 1A) or HF cells(data not shown) at any concentration tested, compared withcontrolcultures.Incontrast,rhBMP-2stimulatedproliferationofthe three HM cell samples at concentrations .50 ng/mL (Figure
1B).
Effects of rhBMP-2 on ALP Activity
rhBMP-2 significantly increased ALP activity in all of the HBM
cell samples at a concentration of 500 ng/mL, compared withthose in cultures without rhBMP-2 ( Figure 2A). The maximum
effect of rhBMP-2 at this concentration was observed in HBM-6cells with a 5.4-fold increase compared with untreated cells.Dose-response experiments showed increased ALP activity inHBM-5 cells treated with rhBMP-2 at concentrations .50 ng/
mL, and in HBM-1, HBM-2, HBM-3, HBM-4, and HBM-6 cellsat concentrations .250 ng/mL (Figure 2A).
ALP activity in all of the HM cell samples was significantly
increased by treatment for 3 days with 500 ng/mL rhBMP-2(Figure 2B). rhBMP-2 significantly elevated enzyme activity inall HM cell samples at concentrations .250 ng/mL.

Effects of rhBMP-2 on PTH Responsiveness
We assessed PTH response by measuring cAMP production in
fourHBMcellsamples(HBM-1,-2,-4,and-5)treatedfor3dayswith or without 500 ng/mL rhBMP-2. rhBMP-2 significantlyelevated PTH responses in HBM-1, HBM-2, and HBM-5 cells(Figure 3 A) with the maximum effect observed in HBM-5 cells,
comparedwiththatinBMP-2-untreatedcells.Noapparenteffectof rhBMP-2 was observed in HBM-4 cells. rhBMP-2 signifi-cantly increased PTH responses in three of the four HM cellsamples tested (HM-1, -3, and -5) compared with each value inrhBMP-2-untreated cells (Figure 3B). No significant increasewas observed in HM-4 cell samples between rhBMP-2-treatedand -untreated cells. Among the skin fibroblasts, one of the HFcell samples (HF-1) exhibited a slight increase in cAMP inresponse to PTH following rhBMP-2 treatment, but it was notsignificantly different from rhBMP-2-untreated cells (Figure3C).Effects of rhBMP-2 on Osteocalcin Production

In all of the HM cell samples tested (HM-1 to -5), 500 ng/mL
rhBMP-2 almost completely inhibited myotube formation asjudged by immunohistochemical staining for MHC ( Figures 5

and.250 ng/mL in two HM cell samples (HM-1 and HM-4)
(Figure 6). Formation of MHC-positive myotubes was almostcompletely inhibited by treatment with 500 ng/mL of rhBMP-2in all of the HM cells.

Transplantation Experiments
HBM-6 cells transplanted for 7 weeks into the peritoneal cavity

In contrast,two of three diffusion chambers transplanted with BMP-2 for 7weeks generated mineralized foci as determined by soft X-rayexamination. Histological examination revealed that these diffu-sion chambers contained calcified cartilage and bone (Figure7B).Largenumbersofunmineralizedhypertrophicchondrocyteswere also observed in the diffusion chambers.

Discussion
BMPs affect proliferation of various cell types. In this study,
BMP-2 induced no changes in proliferation of two HBM cellsamplesisolatedfromhumanbonesandoneHFcellsamplefromhuman skin, while showing a slight stimulatory effect on prolif-eration of three HM cell samples isolated from human muscle.Shibano et al.
20also demonstrated that rhBMP-2 induced no
significant changes in the doubling time of cultured osteogenicstromal cells. Zheng et al.
33reported that rhBMP-2 stimulated
cell proliferation in a human osteoblast-like cell line (HOB1T).The discrepancy in the effects of rhBMP-2 on cell proliferationbetween our osteoblast-like cells and HOB1T might have beendue to the difference in nature of the cells used; that is, primarycells isolated from human bones vs. human cell lines establishedby transfection with SV40 large T antigen.

Figure8 summarizestherelativeeffectsofrhBMP-2onALP
activity, PTH response, and osteocalcin production in each cellsample tested in the present study. Our results indicate thatrhBMP-2 stimulated ALP activity and/or PTH responsiveness,early markers of osteoblast differentiation, in many cells isolatedfrom bone, muscle, and skin. These results raise the possibilitythat rhBMP-2 stimulated osteoblast differentiation in humancellsisolatednotonlyfrombonesbutalsofrommuscleandskin,as demonstrated in rodents.
10,11,22,23,27,30,31However, the mag-
nitudes of these stimulatory effects differed among the cellstested. In addition, the stimulatory effects of rhBMP-2 on ALPactivityandPTHresponsivenessdidnotalwayscorrelateeveninthe same cell population. These results suggest that the stimula-tory effects of rhBMP-2 on ALP activity and PTH responsive-ness were regulated differently by rhBMP-2, because we mea-suredtheseparametersusingthesamesamplesofcellstopreventchanges caused by passage. Alternatively, these results might beattributabletoheterogeneityofthecellsusedinthepresentstudy.
Opposite effects of BMP on ALP activity between cell types
used were also reported by Knutsen et al.

osteocalcin, which is a marker of more mature osteoblasts, in
many cells isolated from rats and mice. Lecanda et al.13recently
reported that rhBMP-2 stimulated osteocalcin production in bothhumanbonemarrowstromalcells(relativelyimmaturepreosteo-blastic cells) and osteoblasts (more differentiated osteoblasts);rhBMP-2 more effectively stimulated osteocalcin production inthe former than in the latter. Amedee et al.
1also reported that
BMP-3 induced osteocalcin synthesis in human bone marrow-derived cells as well as type I collagen production, ALP activity,and PTH response.
In contrast, in the present study, rhBMP-2 induced no pro-
duction of osteocalcin in any of the cells tested, but inhibited1,25-(OH)
2vitamin D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis. We also
confirmed inhibitory effects of rhBMP-2 on 1,25-(OH)2vitamin
D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis in bone cells isolated from
humanmandibulaeatbothmRNAandproteinlevels(manuscriptsubmitted). Recently, Shibano et al.
20reported that rhBMP-2
exerted no stimulatory effect on osteocalcin production in osteo-genicstromalcells,whereas1,25-(OH)
2vitaminD3stimulatedits
production in the same cell population. Thus, the in vitro effectsof BMPs on osteoblast differentiation in human cells are contro-versial. This might be due to differences in the nature of humanosteoblast-like cells depending on methods used for isolation ofcells and donor characteristics such as age. Although isolation ofhomogeneous cell populations from normal human tissues isvery difficult at present,
18it will be important to develop more
consistent techniques to isolate human cells for further investi-gation into the effects of BMPs on human cells. Extensiveinvestigation of BMP receptors will also provide insight into themechanism responsible for the conflicting effects of BMPs onhuman cells.
To confirm further that rhBMP-2 induced osteoblast differ-
entiation in human cells, we transplanted human bone-derivedcells into athymic mice using diffusion chambers. The cellsisolated from human bones formed bone in the diffusion cham-

This indicates that rhBMP-2 promoted the formation of bonefrom bone-derived human cells. In our in vitro experiments,rhBMP-2 induced no osteocalcin production in HBM cells, andinhibited 1,25-(OH)
2vitamin D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis.
Osteocalcin production is believed to be a marker of matureosteoblasts, but our in vitro and in vivo experiments raised thepossibility that synthesis of osteocalcin in vitro cannot simplyreflect an ability to form bone in vivo. This was supported byrecentfindingsinosteocalcinknockoutmice;thatis,osteocalcin-deficient mice exhibited increased bone formation, comparedwithwild-typecontrols.
7Wedemonstrated,byinvivotransplan-
tation experiments, that the cells isolated from human bones alsoformed cartilage in the diffusion chambers in response to rh-BMP-2. In our in vitro experiments, however, rhBMP-2 inducedno chondrocyte differentiation in human bone-derived cells, asjudged by Alcian blue staining and immunohistochemical anal-ysis of type II collagen expression (unpublished observation).These results suggest that human bone-derived cells retain thecapacity to differentiate into both osteoblasts and chondrocytesin response to rhBMP-2, whereas their capacity might be moreeasily evoked following in vivo transplantation into athymicmice than in simplified in vitro culture systems.
When muscular tissues are injured or exposed to some dys-
trophic stimuli, the satellite cells, which are mononuclear cellslying along the muscle fibers in the normal muscle, divide anddifferentiate into myoblasts, which fuse to form muscle fibers.

The effects of BMPs on muscle cell differentiation have beenreported.
15,31We also reported that rhBMP-2 not only inhibited
muscledifferentiationbutalsoconvertedthedifferentiationpath-way into the osteoblast lineage in both the C2C12 myoblastsoriginating from satellite cells and the primary myogenic cellsisolated from newborn mice.
11This suggests that the satellite
cellswerepotentialprogenitorsdifferentiatingintoosteoblastsinresponse to BMPs during ectopic bone formation in musculartissues. To examine whether a similar conversion occurs inhuman muscle-derived cells, we investigated the effects of rh-BMP-2 on differentiation of cells isolated from human muscle.rhBMP-2 strongly inhibited the formation of MHC-positivemyotubes and increased osteoblast phenotypic markers such asALP activity and PTH responsiveness in human muscle-derivedcells. However, rhBMP-2 could not induce these cells to differ-entiate into more mature osteoblasts producing osteocalcin asshown in rodent cells.
11In addition, transplantation of myogenic
cells with rhBMP-2 using diffusion chambers into athymic miceinduced ALP-positive cells within the chambers, but did notinduce the formation of bone or cartilage. Interestingly, severalreports have demonstrated that transplantation of BMPs intoprimate muscle induced no or less ectopic bone formation,
2–4,14
whereas such transplantation effectively induced ectopic bone
formation in rodents. There is a possibility that the potential ofhuman muscle cells for differentiation into other cell lineages,including osteoblasts and chondrocytes, might be more restrictedwhen compared with that in lower animals such as rodents.Further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Transplantation of BMPs into subcutaneous tissues also in-
duced ectopic bone formation in rodents. We confirmed thatrhBMP-2 induced osteoblast differentiation in cultured skin fi-broblasts isolated from adult rats (unpublished results). Becausethese observations suggest that multipotent progenitors capableof differentiation into osteogenic cells in response to BMPs arealso present in the subcutaneous tissues, we investigated theosteogenic potential of human skin fibroblasts. rhBMP-2 stimu-lated ALP activity in all of the skin fibroblast samples, but failedtoinduceosteocalcinproduction.Thus,thedifferentiationcapac-ity into osteogenic lineages of cells from human subcutaneous
tissues might also be more restricted than that in rodents.
Inthepresentstudy,wedemonstratedthatrhBMP-2promotes
osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation in human bone-de-rived cells by in vitro and in vivo experiments. These resultssupport the potential clinical application of rhBMP-2, but furtherstudies, including investigation of the molecular aspects of theseeffects, are necessary to clarify precisely the mechanism ofaction of rhBMP-2 in human cells.
