teoprogenitors (OP) attach to the matrix and differentiateinto osteoblasts.

Introduction
Numerous studies have shown that adhesive events are of para-
mount importance for bone cell function.32In particular, the
recruitment of osteoblast progenitors (OP), a critical step inendochondral ossification
12and bone remodeling,31not onlyinvolves the proliferation and differentiation of precursors, but
also their migration and attachment, through interactions withmatrix proteins, to the sites of bone formation. Several glyco-proteins have been shown to be involved in the binding of bonecells to the extracellular matrix. Some of these are principallylocalized to bone tissue and are secreted mostly by cells ofosteoblastic lineage (e.g., bone sialoprotein [BSP]
9,14), whereas
others are produced by various cell types (e.g., osteopontin10)o r
areubiquitousinsoftconnectivetissues(e.g.,collagen,fibronec-tin, and vitronectin). Although much work has been devoted tostudying the attachment of osteoblastic cell lines and/or normalbone cells of undefined/mixed differentiation stages to matrixcomponents found in the bone environment, the respective con-tributions of these different cell binding proteins to the specificattachment of early, progenitor stages of the osteoblast lineagehave not yet been investigated.
Because of the absence of specific markers allowing direct
identification of OP cells, indirect systems are required for theirstudy, such as the well-characterized primary fetal rat calvarial(RC) cell culture system (reviewed in Aubin and Liu
3). When
enzymatically isolated RC cells are grown in medium supple-mented with ascorbic acid and b-glycerophosphate, OP form
three-dimensionalbonecolonies(nodules),
6,29inwhichanupper
layer of cuboidal osteoblasts deposit an extracellular matrix thathas the histological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemicalappearance of woven bone.
8Limiting dilution analysis,4as well
as bone nodule formation by cells plated at very low density(;10 cell/cm
2)21has shown that one bone nodule originates
from one OP cell under standard culture conditions. Thus, OPpresent in RC cell cultures can be detected through their abilityto form mineralizing bone nodules, a characteristic colony typeeasy to identify and quantitate. It is therefore possible to use RCcell cultures as an in vitro model to quantify and analyzeexperimentally the population of OP plated and attached.
In the present study, we used the RC cell culture system to
develop a specific assay for OP attachment to various matrixproteins, and we compared these proteins in their capacity torecruit OP. We show that laminin-1 selects OP by favoring theirattachment to the matrix, while being antiadhesive for other cellsin the populations plated. In particular, laminin-1 efficientlyrecruits OP from early, undifferentiated RC cell populations, ofwhich laminins are an abundant extracellular matrix component.

labo (Strasbourg, France). Sterile culture plasticware was ob-tained from Falcon-Becton Dickinson (Beford, MA). Ascorbicacid, b-glycerophosphate, and sodium pyruvate were purchased
from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Bovine serum albumin(BSA),
L-cysteine, and dexamethasone were obtained from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Chromatography resins were purchasedfrom Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Guanidinium chloride wasfrom Sigma, and other biochemical reagents were from Merck.
Matrix Proteins
An ethylene-diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) extract of noncol-
lagenousproteinsfromfetalbovinelongboneswaspreparedandseparated by gel-filtration chromatography in 4 mol/L guani-dinium chloride on a Sepharose-CL6B gel-filtration tandemcolumn.
26Chromatographyfractionswerecollected,pooled,and
dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and their con-tent was characterized by dot immunoblotting with antibodiesagainst major extracellular matrix proteins. Rat plasma vitronec-tin, human plasma fibronectin, bovine fetuin ( a
2-HS glycopro-
tein), rat-tail type I collagen, and mouse EHS tumor laminin-1were purchased from Sigma, and laminin-1 purified from entac-tin was purchased from Becton Dickinson. Human tenascin(tenascin-C) was purchased from Gibco. Porcine BSP and OPNwerepurifiedfromthe0.5mol/LEDTAextractsofadultporcinecalvarie on a fast protein liquid chomatography system (Pharma-cia) using techniques described elsewhere.
17Bovine bone osteo-
calcin was isolated and purified as previously described.26
Protein Coating
Cell-attachment assays were performed in 48 well plates. Coat-
ing was performed as described elsewhere,19with modifications.
The proteins were dissolved in PBS supplemented with 1mmol/L CaCl
2, and 100 mL of each solution was deposited in
each well (1 cm2area). After 24 h incubation at 4°C with gentle
shaking, the supernatants containing unbound protein were col-lected and assayed using the micro-BCA assay kit (Pierce,Rockford,IL),todeterminetheamounteffectivelyadsorbed.Theminimum coating concentration providing maximal effect in thecell-attachment assay (10 mg/mL for all proteins) was used in all
experiments shown unless otherwise specified, with the excep-tion of tenascin, which reached its maximum binding capacity at5mg/ml. Coated plates were washed three times with PBS, then
saturated fo r1ha troom temperature with 200 mL of 0.1% BSA
heat denatured in Hepes-buffered saline (10 mmol/L Hepes,0.135 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl
2,2
mmol/L CaCl2, pH 5.3). After saturation, the fluid was aspirated
and each plate was washed three times with PBS.
Rat Calvarial Cell Isolation and Culture
Cells were enzymatically isolated from the calvariae of 21-day-old
Wistarratfetusesbysequentialdigestionwithcollagenase,6andthe
populations obtained from each digestion step (I–V) were platedinto 75 cm
2tissue culture flasks in a-MEM, 15% heat-inactivated
FCSwithantibiotics(50IU/mLpenicillin,50IU/mLstreptomycin).After 24 h at 37°C, the cells were released with 0.01% trypsin incitrate-saline, counted, and resuspended in different media depend-ing on the experiment. The populations used in the cell-attachmentexperiments were pools of digests II–V, except when individualdigestsweretested(see ResultsandFigure5).Inexperimentsaimed
at assessing the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on bone noduleformationinthesuccessivepopulations,cellsfromeachdigest(I–V)were plated independently (100/cm
2)i na-MEM, containing 10%FCS, antibiotics, 0.28 mmol/L ascorbic acid, and 10 mmol/L
b-glycerophosphate(culturemedium),thengrownfor15daysinthe
same medium with or without 10 nmol/L Dex; medium waschanged every 2–3 days. The cultures were then fixed and bonenodules were counted after Von Kossa staining under an invertedmicroscope.

Assays for Osteoprogenitor Attachment
Time-limited cell attachment assay. Harvested cells were resus-
pended in a-MEM, containing 1% BSA, 1 mmol/L L-cysteine, 1
mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 10 mg/mL transferrin, 0.28 mmol/L
ascorbic acid, and antibiotics, and left to recover at 37°C for 40min. For time-limited cell-attachment assays ( Figure 1 ), cells
were plated at 2000 cells/cm
2in wells coated or not (control)
with various amounts of protein and saturated as just described.After5,10,15,or20min,nonadherentandlooselyadherentcellswere aspirated, and the wells refilled with culture medium. After3–4 h, adherent cells were fixed in plates with 3.7% (v/v)formaldehyde in PBS, washed with distilled water, stained withmethylene blue, and counted under a phase-contrast microscope.Alternate plates, matched for plating time and coating, weregrown for 15 days in culture medium containing 10 nmol/L Dex.
Depletion experiments. Depletion experiments were cell-at-
tachment assays in which, after the first 10 min of plating onlaminin-1-coated or control wells (first selection), unattachedcells were replated on a second well for an additional 10 min(second selection). Cells still unattached were then replated inwells prefilled with a-MEM supplemented with FCS (10% final
concentration, recovery step), and matched plates were eitherprocessed for cell counting or grown for bone nodule formation,as described earlier.
Osteoprogenitor differentiation assay. For differentiation as-
says, the cells were plated in culture medium (containing 10%FCS) on wells coated with various proteins, but not saturatedwith denatured BSA. After 24 h, the medium containing unat-tached cells was removed, and matched plates were either pro-cessed for cell counting or grown for bone nodule formation, asdescribed earlier.
In all experiments, in order to reduce intra-assay variability,
coated and control wells for a given test were on the same plate.
Statistical Analysis
The data were subjected to Kruskal–Wallis or Mann–Whitney
U-tests, using I
NSTATsoftware (Graphpad, San Diego, CA) or to
two-way analysis of variance (A NOVA) using S UPERANOVA soft-
ware (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).
Results
Development of Assay for Osteoprogenitor RecruitmentThe relationship between the number of adherent cells and the
number of nodules developed was investigated over a range of100–1000 cells plated per square centimeter, corresponding to75610 to 538 620 cells actually attached after 24 h (n 58
wells per plating density). As reported previously by others,
4
there was a linear relationship ( r50.996) between the number
of nodules formed and the number of cells attached, with a meanratio of 7 63.3 nodules per 100 cells attached (n 54 cell
densities tested; Figure 1A) in our experiments. When RC cellswere plated for 5–20 min on uncoated plates saturated withdenatured BSA (control conditions), according to the protocol330 P. Roche et al. Bone Vol. 24, No. 4

showninFigure1B,thenumberofcellsattachedandthenumber
of nodules formed increased with plating time (Figure 1C).However, in accordance with the results of cell-dilution analysis(Figure 1A), the ratio (nodules formed per 100 cells attached)wasthesameatalltimepointstested(6.5 62.1,n 54timepoints
tested,p50.93 between timepoints, using the Kruskal–Wallis
test), indicating that the proportion of OP among the adherentcells remained constant. These results allowed us to use time-limiting plating of RC cells as a test of the relative affinity of OPfor various protein substrates.
Cell Attachment to Purified Extracellular Matrix Proteins
In a preliminary study (data not shown), gel-filtration chroma-
tographyfractionsofbovineboneproteinextractsweretestedforRC cell attachment and OP recruitment in time-limited cell-attachment assays, as described earlier. These experimentsshowed that high-molecular-weight (void volume) fractions in-hibited RC cell attachment but increased the proportion of OPamong the cells attached, whereas fractions of lower molecular
weight had no effect. Immunoblotting studies showed that effi-cient fractions were enriched in tenascin, laminin, fibronectin,BSP, and osteopontin, which prompted us to test these proteins,along with vitronectin, type I collagen, osteocalcin, and a
2-HS
glycoprotein/fetuin, as purified reagents in the assay. In thesetests, although the number of cells attached to control wells wasvariable from assay to assay, the difference in cell adhesionbetween control wells and wells coated with a given proteinsample was reproducible over a range of independent experi-ments. Of all the proteins tested, cell attachment was stronglystimulatedascomparedwithcontrolsbyfibronectin( 32.3),type
I collagen ( 33), and vitronectin ( 32.4) (not shown), as well as
BSP (Figure 2). Tenascin (not shown) and laminin-1 (Figure 2)
inhibited RC cell attachment at all timepoints tested; other
proteins had no effect. As an average of five independentexperiments, RC cell attachment to laminin-1 was 52 611% of
control after 5 min of plating, and this effect was sustained overtime, with attachment being 48 617% of control after 20 min.

Osteoprogenitor Recruitment by Purified Extracellular
Matrix Protein
ThenumberofbonenodulesdevelopedandtheproportionofOP
observed on most proteins tested was the same as with controls(notshown).InwellscoatedwithBSP,theproportionofOPwassignificantly reduced at all timepoints after 5 min of plating(Figure 2), although the absolute number of bone nodules devel-oped was increased (not shown), reflecting the increased numberof cells attached as compared with controls.
In contrast, the proportion of OP among the cells attached to
laminin-1 was significantly increased in all individual experi-mentsconducted(Figure2).Thiseffectwasobservedafter5minof plating (422 6162% of controls, n 55 independent exper-
iments) and was sustained over time, the ratio remaining at350629%ofcontrols(n 55)after20min.WhenRCcellswere
plated on increasing amounts of coated laminin-1, cell attach-ment decreased dose-dependently ( Figure 3A), while the abso-
lute number of nodules formed (Figure 3B) increased concomi-tantly with the decrease of cell attachment, as well as the ratio(nodules/100 cells attached) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, signifi-cant OP recruitment occurred at earlier timepoints on higherdensities of coated laminin-1 (not shown). Similar results wereobtainedwithentactin-freelaminin-1(notshown).EnrichmentinOP, with increased bone nodule formation, was also observedwith tenascin, although to a lesser degree (data not shown).
Osteoprogenitor Recruitment by Laminin-1 Is a
Cell-Attachment Effect
Differentiation assay. To investigate the possibility of an action
of the matrix substrate on OP differentiation, RC cells wereplated for 24 h on wells coated with laminin-1 ( Figure 4A). To
ensure maximal cell attachment in this assay, the cells wereplated in culture medium, containing serum-derived cell-attach-ment factors, and the plastic of the culture well was not saturatedwith BSA. One hundred cells were plated per well so that thenumber of adherent cells was similar to cell-attachment assays.
In these conditions, most cells plated (70%–100%) attached tothe wells, and no difference was observed in the number of cellsattached between coated and control wells (not shown). Lami-nin-1 did not significantly stimulate bone nodule formation inthese experiments (Figure 4A). No consistent effect on OPdifferentiation was observed in similar assays either with boneproteinextractfractionsorwiththeotherpurifiedmatrixproteinstested in the cell-attachment assay (not shown).
Depletion experiments. Cell-attachment assays were also
done in which cells that had not attached after 10 min of platingon laminin-1 (first selection) were replated for an additional 10min in a second set of laminin-1-coated wells (second selection);

cells left unattached after this second step were then replated for
24 h in culture medium containing serum (10% final concentra-tion), in uncoated and unsaturated wells (recovery step; Figure4B).Whereaslaminin-1significantlyinhibitedcellattachmentinboth selection steps, the sum of the number of cells attached inthe two selection wells plus the recovery well was the same onlaminin-1 as in controls, showing that coated laminin-1 had nolethal effect on cells (Figure 4B). As shown in Figure 4C, theproportion of OP was strongly decreased in laminin-1 in thesecond selection step as compared with the first one, whereas itdid not vary between successive steps in control wells, and wassignificantly reduced as compared with controls in the recoverystep after selection on laminin-1. Of note, the global ratio(nodules/100 cells attached) obtained by summing all nodulesformed in all successive steps of the experiment and dividing bythe total number of cells attached did not differ between lami-nin-1 and controls (11.3 61.2 vs. 10 62.5%,p50.59; Figure
4C).
Laminin-1 Preferentially Recruits Osteoprogenitors From
Early Populations
WhensuccessiveRCcellpopulations(I–V),obtainedbysequen-
tial collagenase digestion, were grown independently, early pop-ulations (I and II) did not produce bone colonies when grownwithout Dex ( Figure 5A). In wells grown with 10
28mol/L Dex,
these earliest populations formed nodules, albeit very few, re-flecting the scarcity of OP. Later populations (III–V) formednumerous bone nodules in the absence of Dex, but these werefewer than with Dex (Figure 5A). When populations I–V weresubmitted independently to time-limited cell-attachment assaywith laminin-1, the attachment of cells from all populations wasinhibited to the same extent (data not shown). Cells from allpopulationsthatattachedtolaminin-1wereenrichedinOPwhengrown with 10
28mol/L Dex (Figure 5B). However, the effi-
ciency of OP selection was proportionately higher in earlier vs.later populations (i.e., 1700 61500% of controls in population
I,p,0.05 vs. populations II, IV, and V, and 470 6130% in
population II, p,0.05 vs. 250 650% and 200 620%,
respectively, in populations IV and V).
Discussion
In the present study, we investigated a time-limited cell-attach-
ment assay developed to test the ability of various proteinsubstrates to recruit OP through selective, high-affinity cellbinding. In this assay, laminin-1 inhibited RC cell attachmentand strongly increased OP recruitment; other matrix proteinstestedhadnoorlittlesignificanteffectonbonenoduleformation,except for tenascin, which showed properties similar to lami-nin-1. Of note, the action of laminin-1 reported here cannot beascribed to a possible contamination with entactin, as entactin-freelaminin-1hadthesameeffectonRCcellattachmentandOPselection. Several studies reported enhanced attachment of im-mortalizedosteoblasticcelllinesorprimaryosteoblastsplatedonlaminin-1 for 45 min to 2 h.
1,18,24,33,36In the present work, RC
cells were plated for a very short time (5–20 min), in order todetect small differences in affinity between OP and other celltypes. Thus, we may have assessed early and rapid cell attach-ment events that occur before cellular responses, e.g., receptorrecruitment or protein synthesis, can modify cell/substrate inter-actions. For instance, the mixed RC cell population displayed ahigher affinity for BSP than for osteopontin in our experiments,which may not have been apparent in studies done with platingtimes of $1 h, and shows the sensitivity of time-limited assays
such as the one used here.

April 1999:329–336 Osteoprogenitor attachment to laminin
Matrix proteins may affect the proliferation and differentia-
tion of adherent cells. For instance, Moursi et al.28recently
analyzed the effect of fibronectin on osteogenesis in RC cellcultures, and showed that initiation and/or maturation of bonenodules can be blocked by fibronectin fragments. In our exper-iments, it is conceivable that laminin-1 would have induced thecommitment to the osteoblast lineage of some progenitors thatmay be present in the RC cell population, but would not differ-entiate as osteoblasts in normal conditions. To clarify this point,experimentsweredesignedinwhichanyeffectofcoatedproteinsoncellattachmentwasbypassed,inordertotestspecificallytheiraction on OP differentiation. In these tests, bone nodule forma-tion by cells plated on laminin-1 was not significantly differentfrom controls. Also, depletion experiments showed that short-duration plating on laminin-1 enriched the cell population at-tached to it in OP, and depleted the recovered population, as
wouldbeexpectedfromacell-attachmentprocess.Moreover,theoverall nodule-cell ratio for all cells attached in selection 1
recovery steps was not higher for laminin-1-selected cells thanfor controls, indicating that no “new” progenitor had differenti-ated in the population plated on laminin-1 and that only thedistribution of OP in the successive attachment steps hadchanged. Vukicevik et al.
36reported a stimulation of the expres-
sion of the osteoblast phenotype in MC3T3-E1 and RC cellsplated on laminin-1, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase stain-ing. However, no attempt was done in their work to address theheterogeneity of RC cell populations, and it is not clear whethertheirobservationsreflectthedifferentiationofuncommitedcells,or phenotypic modulation of cells already commited to theosteoblast lineage. Also, although bone nodule formation wasobserved in their cultures, no quantitation was reported. Al-thoughfewercellsattachedtolaminin-1inourexperiments,theyformed a greater absolute number of nodules than in controlwells (see Figure 3), suggesting that laminin-1 actively promotesthe attachment of OP to the substrate, thus exerting a positiveselection. An alternate hypothesis is that laminin-1 inhibits theattachment of at least one other cell type, whose presence wouldinhibit OP differentiation in the culture. To the best of ourknowledge, no evidence of such an effect has been reported inthe RC cell culture system–in contrast to rat bone marrowstromalcellcultures,inwhichinhibitionofOPdifferentiationbyaddedfibroblasticcellshasbeendocumented.
30Thelattermodel
does not show a linear relationship between bone nodule forma-tion and cell numbers in limiting dilution analysis, which sug-geststheinterferenceofatleastoneothercelltypeintheprocessof OP differentiation.
2Although the linear relationship men-
tioned earlier between RC cells plated and nodules formed4(see
also Figure 1) does not provide evidence for the existence in thismodel of a limiting cell type other than the OP itself, our resultsdo not rule out the possibility of the negative selection of one orseveral hitherto undiscovered inhibitory cell types.
Laminins are a family of heterotrimeric proteins for which 11
different variants have been described to date, composed fromfive types of achains, three types of bchains, and two types of
gchains.
23,27,34Most studies on cell attachment, including ours,
have used laminin-1 ( a1,b1,g1). The cellular receptors for
laminins include eight different integrins, mostly from the b1
group, as well as nonintegrin receptors, such as dystroglycan.25
Adhesive sequences have been described in the N-terminal arm
of the b1chain (LGTIPG, YIGSR) and in the long arm of a1
(IKVAV).34An antiadhesive site has also been postulated in the
short arm of a1.11,15The attachment of osteoblast-like cells to
laminin-1 has been shown to be blocked by antilaminin antibod-ies and antagonized by IKVAV.
36In experiments not shown
here, we confirmed the high affinity of RC cells for IKVAV;however, no antilaminin antibody nor any adhesive sequencepeptidefromlaminin-1couldblockorcompete-outtheinhibitionof cell attachment, nor the selection of OP by laminin-1, asobserved in our assays. Other groups
11,22have reported the
inability of antilaminin antibodies to block the antiadhesiveactivity of laminin-1. Experiments are underway to identify thedomains/sequencesandcellreceptorsinvolvedintheinteractionsof the RC cell population and of OP with laminin-1.
Glucocorticoids such as Dex strongly stimulate bone nodule
formation in RC cell cultures.
5Using RC cell sorting and
immunopanning, Turksen and Aubin35have shown the existence
of two types of OP, a presumably earlier one, which does notexpress alkaline phosphatase and requires Dex to undergo osteo-blastic differentiation, and a later, alkaline phosphatase-positive,Dex-independent type.

which laminin-1 was the most efficient were the first ones
(populations I and II), corresponding to fibroblast-like, easilyaccessible cell populations and containing earlier, less differen-tiatedcellstages.
13Thesepopulationswerealsothemostrespon-
sive to Dex for bone nodule formation, suggesting that they areenriched in early OP. Our data thus indicate a more efficientselection on laminin-1 of the early OP population, such as thosepresent in the periosteal compartment of the calvaria.
Although laminin-1 has long been used as a paradigm for the
whole laminin family, this variant has recently been shown tohave a very restricted distribution,
27and is not likely to be
present in bone. However, laminins are the major component ofbasement membranes,
34and angiogenesis and vascular invasion
arecloselyassociatedwiththeprocessesofneo-osteogenesisandfracture repair.
12The stromal component of bone marrow orig-
inates in the periosteum, and penetrates the newly formed mar-row cavity of bone along with the blood vessels
7at sites where
abundant laminin expression has been documented.16,20Also, in
adult bone, vascular components such as fenestrated capillariesarealwayspresentinthevicinityofboneformingcells.Lamininsare thus likely to be locally the most abundant component of thecell microenvironment, although the identity and distribution ofthe variants expressed during bone development and remodelingremain to be established. Also, our results are reminiscent of theopposite adhesive and antiadhesive effects of laminin-1 fordifferent neuronal populations,
22which prompted investigators
tosuggestaroleforlamininsinorientedcellmigrationwithintheneural tissue.
11,23Obviously caution must be observed in extrap-
olating the results of a time-limited assay to a situation in whichthe cells maintain permanent contact with a more complexenvironment, and ultimately only in vivo studies can clarify thepossible role of laminins in the cell biology of bone. Whateverthe biological significance of our observations, the discovery ofa protein with a high affinity for early OP will provide anapproach for enriching, by cell-sorting techniques, this precursorpopulation whose study has so far been much hampered by thelack of specific markers.
