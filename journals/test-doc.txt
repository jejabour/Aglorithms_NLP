Tibia calcium and phosphorusSilicon-de ﬁciency studies in growing animals in the early 1970s reported stunted growth and profound defects in
bone and other connective tissues. However, more recent attempts to replicate these ﬁndings have found mild
alterations in bone metabolism without any adverse health effects. Thus the biological role of silicon remains
unknown. Using a speci ﬁcally formulated silicon-depleted diet and modern methods for silicon analysis and
assessment of skeletal development, we undertook, through in ternational collaboration between silicon researchers,
an extensive study of long-term silicon depletion on ske letal development in an animal. 21-day old female Sprague –
Dawley rats ( n=20) were fed a silicon-depleted diet (3.2 µg Si/g feed) for 26 weeks and their growth and skeletal
development were compared with identical rats ( n=10) on the same diet but with silicon added as Si(OH) 4to their
drinking water (53.2 µg Si/g water); total silicon intakes were 24 times different.
