Abstract-The rate of production of aggregation pheromone by male larger grain borer beetles, 
Prostephunus truncutus (Horn), is greatly reduced in the presence of live, conspecific female 
beetles. A similar effect is observed in the absence of live female beetles when males are placed 
on maize that was previously infested with males and females, suggesting that it is due to some 
chemical residue left by tbe females. This was shown to persist for at least 15 days, to be involatile_ 
and not perceived by receptors on the antennae of the males. Attempts to extract the chemical(s) 
responsible and transfer it to a new substrate gave variable results. Extraction of 
previously-infested maize with bexane, ether, dichloromethane, butanone or water under different 
conditions probably did not remove the suppression effect, but Soxblet extraction with methanol 
did. However, when the resulting extract was recoated onto various substrates, no reduction in 
pheromone production by males could he demonstrated, suggesting that the methanol is extracting 
and/or destroying the chemical(s) responsible. Crown Copyright 0 1966 Published by Elsevier

INTRODUCTION 
The larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn), is a pest of farm-stored maize and cassava 
and was once considered to be a sporadic, minor pest restricted to meso-America (McGuire and 
Crandall, 1967). In 1981, its presence was confirmed in Tanzania (Dunstan and Magazini, 1981; 
Hodges et al., 1983) and it has subsequently been reported in other countries in East and West 
Africa, including Kenya (Kega and Warui, 1983; Muhihu and Kibata, 1985), Togo (Harnisch and 
Krall, 1984; Krall, 1984), Ghana (Dick and Rees, 1989), Guinea (Kalivogui and Miick, 1991), 
Burkina Faso (Bosque-Perez et al., 1991), Nigeria (Pike et al., 1992) as well as Burundi, Benin, 
Malawi and Rwanda (unpublished in Hodges, 1994). It has become established rapidly, and in 
Tanzania is now frequently the major pest of farm-stored maize, capable of causing weight losses 
in excess of 30% during six months (Hodges et al., 1983; Hodges, 1986, 1994; McFarlane, 1988).

Male P. truncatus were shown to produce an aggregation pheromone attracting conspecific male 
and female beetles, and the components of this were identified as 1-methylethyl (E)-Zmethyl-Zpen- 
tenoate (Trunc-call 1, Tl) and 1-methylethyl (E,E)-2,4-dimethyL2,4_heptadienoate (Trunc-call 2, 
T2) (Fig. 1) (Cork et al., 1991; Dendy et al., 1989, 1991). 
During the initial identification work (Cork et al., 1991), pheromone was collected from large, 
mixed-sex cultures. Amounts of pheromone collected were extremely small, and it was only possible 
to identify the structure of the major component, Tl. Subsequently, it was found that, in the 
absence of female beetles, male P. truncatus produced much larger amounts of pheromone, so that 
sufficient could be collected for the second component to be identified. In contrast, the presence 
of conspecific female beetles did not inhibit production of aggregation pheromone by males of the 
related lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Cork et al., 1991; Mayhew and Phillips, 
1994), and this paper describes further investigations of the inhibitory effect of females and their 
residues on production of the aggregation pheromone by male P. truncatus. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Insect material 
The insects were from a laboratory culture maintained on shelled maize in darkness at 27°C and 
70% r.h. The colony used in the first phase of the work from 1985-1986 was started from insects 
collected in the field in Tanzania during 1982. The colony used in the second phase originated from 
insects collected in Togo during 1990. Insects were sexed as adults according to the procedure of 
Shires and McCarthy (1976). 
Collection of volatiles 
During the first phase of the work, volatiles were collected from 20 male beetles which had been 
conditioned on wheat flour at approximately 1 adult/g for 3 days prior to the test. These were 
maintained on one of various test substrates (100 g) in a 250 ml drechsel bottle held at 27°C in 
darkness. Charcoal filtered air was drawn through the apparatus at 0.4 or 0.6 l/min and then 
through either a glass filter (110 x 6 mm OD) packed with Porapak Q (100 mg; 50-80 mesh; 
Millipore) held between plugs of silanised glass wool, or a similar filter (4 mm id) containing 
activated charcoal (5 mg; 0.05-O. 1 mm) held between stainless steel frits (Grob and Zurcher, 1976; 
Nesbitt et al., 1979; Tumlinson et al., 1982). The filters were replaced every 24 h and the volatiles 
recovered by percolating dichloromethane (1 ml for Porapak filters, 0.5 ml for charcoal filters) 
through the adsorbent. A mixture of hexyl acetate, octyl acetate and decyl acetate (2 pg each) was 
added as internal standards and the two pheromone components, Tl and T2, were assayed 
quantitatively by capillary gas chromatography on a Carlo Erba series 4160 gas chromatograph 
equipped with a flame ionisation detector (220°C) and Grob splitless injector (200°C). Columns 
were fused silica capillary columns (25 m x 0.32 mm id) coated with either non-polar CP Sil 5 CB 
(chemically bonded methylsilicone; Chrompack) or polar CP Wax57 CB (chemically bonded 
Carbowax 20 M equivalent; Chrompack). Carrier gas was helium (linear velocity 25 cm/s), and 
the oven temperature was held at 50°C for 2 min, then temperature programmed to increase at 
4”C/min to 200°C. The pheromone components, Tl and T2, were quantified by comparison of their 
peak areas with those of the hexyl and decyl acetate internal standards, respectively. 
A standard procedure was developed for the second phase of the work, in which 10 male beetles 
were maintained on the test substrate (50 g) in a 100 ml Pyrex Buchner flask held at 27°C in 
darkness. Charcoal filtered air was drawn through the apparatus at 2 l/min and then through a 
glass filter (110 x 6 mm od) packed with Porapak Q (100 mg; 50-80 mesh, Millipore). Every 24 h 
the filter was replaced and the volatiles were recovered by percolating dichloromethane (750 ~1) 
through the Porapak Q. Octyl acetate (2 pg) was added to the extract as an internal standard and 
the two pheromone components, Tl and T2, were assayed quantitatively by capillary gas 
chromatography as above using the non-polar CP Sil 5CB column. The identity of the peaks 
corresponding to the two pheromone components was confirmed from time to time by gas 
chromatography linked to mass spectrometry (Cork et al., 1991). 
Inhibition of pheromone production in P. truncatus 173 
Preparation of extracts from infested maize 
The infested maize used in these studies was obtained from batches of heavily infested cultures 
of P. truncatus just prior to re-culturing, i.e. at least two months old. The maize was placed in 
a freezer at - 20°C for 48 h to kill all adult beetles as well as other developmental stages before 
use. 
Extracts were prepared from batches of infested maize (300 g) by Soxhlet extraction for 5 h in 
methanol, hexane, ether, dichloromethane, butanone or water (1 I), or by soaking the infested maize 
at room temperature in methanol for 24 h. The extract was then filtered and the extracted maize 
washed with clean solvent, then dried in a fume cupboard for 24 h. Extracts were also prepared 
by agitating the infested maize in methanol or water in an ice-cooled ultrasonic bath for 6 h then 
filtering as above. 
Extracts were recoated onto substrates (maize or cassava) by soaking the substrate in the extract 
for 1 h at a concentration of I g equivalent of extract per 1 g of substrate. Solvent was removed 
by evaporation in a rotary evaporator, and then by spreading out the substrate on aluminium foil 
in a fume-cupboard at ambient temperature for 24 h. 
Experimental design 
Two or three replicates of each treatment were run simultaneously, and results are expressed in 
terms of the mean rate of production of the major pheromone component, Tl, per beetle per hour. 
Even though recent reports have suggested that T2 is the component contributing most to the 
attractiveness of the pheromone blend (Fadamiro, 1995; Leos-Martinez et al., 1995), quantification 
of TI was more accurate at low rates of pheromone production, and the rate of production of the 
minor pheromone component, T2, was lO-20% of the rate of Tl in all cases. In all experiments, 
rates of pheromone production were measured at frequent intervals, generally every 24 h. In 
experiments to investigate the effects of solvent extraction and impregnation of the substrate, the 
rate of production after approximately 96 h was used for comparisons between treatments. Where 
appropriate, differences between mean rates of production were tested for significance by a t-test. 
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
Eflect of age on pheromone production 
Because it was very difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of male P. truncatus beetles of the same 
age on a regular basis, beetles of varying and undetermined ages were used in experiments. In order 
to confirm that this was unlikely to have a significant effect on the results of the experiments, the 
effect of age on pheromone production was checked by regular monitoring of pheromone 
production by three groups of 10 male beetles placed on maize soon after emergence. Mean rates 
of pheromone production are plotted in Fig. 2 which shows mean daily rates for the first five days 
and thereafter means for five-day periods with at least one recording from each replicate during 
each period. 
The rate of pheromone production increased steadily and then levelled off after about 10-l 5 days 
(Fig. 2). The beetles start producing pheromone soon after emergence and it would seem that the 
time taken to build up to the maximum rate reflects mainly the time taken for the beetles to establish 
themselves on the maize since similar data were obtained when rates of production from older 
beetles were measured in this way (Figs 3 and 4). After around 50-60 days the rate of pheromone

production started to decline (Fig. 2), presumably as the beetles started to die. This was’confirmed 
in a fourth replicate where pheromone production ceased completely after 66 days and all the 
beetles were found to be dead. 
In experiments described below, beetles used were from O-14 days old at the start of the 
experiment. The above results indicate that this factor should not cause any significant variability 
in results obtained. 
Suppression of pheromone production by female beetles 
In an initial experiment to confirm the effect of the presence of female beetles on pheromone 
production, rates of pheromone production were measured from 20 males only on maize, 20 males 
and 20 females together on maize and 20 males only on plaster of Paris chips. After 72 h, mean 
rates of production were 49.2 ng/h/beetle (significantly different from zero; P < 0.05, t = 4.55, 2 
df), 5.1 ng/h/beetle (not significantly different from zero; P > 0.05, t = 1.40, 2 df and 0.0 
ng/h/beetle, respectively. Even though the beetles were able to bore into the plaster of Paris chips,

no pheromone production could be detected confirming the importance of a food source for 
production of pheromone by the males. 
The rate of pheromone production by male beetles was rapidly reduced on addition of live female 
beetles, but not on addition of dead female beetles (Fig. 3). Thus after 144 h, the mean rate of 
pheromone production in six replicates of 10 male beetles each was 7.2 ng/h/beetle with no 
significant difference between the first three and second three replicates (P > 0.05; t = 1.17, 4 df. 
After addition of 10 live female beetles to the first three replicates and 10 dead female beetles to 
the second three, mean rates during the next 24 h period were 8.3 ng/h/beetle and 31.1 ng/h/beetle 
respectively and these were already significantly different (P < 0.01; t = 6.80,4 df. After a further 
72 h, mean rates were 1.6 ng/h/beetle and 35.1 ng/h/beetle, respectively (Fig. 3), as the rate of 
pheromone production was depressed in the presence of live females but continued to increase in 
the presence of dead females. 
Suppression of pheromone production on previously-infested maize 
The actual presence of live female beetles was not necessary for suppression of pheromone 
production by the males. Male beetles were placed on maize that had previously been infested by 
a mixed-sex culture for at least 60 days followed by killing of the beetles by freezing at - 20°C 
for 48 h. Pheromone production was compared with that of male beetles on uninfested maize that 
had been lightly kibbled to simulate the mechanical effects of beetle infestation (Fig. 4). During 
the first 24 h period, mean rates of pheromone production were 1.6 ng/h/beetle and 7.4 ng/h/beetle, 
respectively, and these means were already significantly different (P < 0.01; t = 6.74, 4 df). Rates 
of production declined on the infested maize and increased on the uninfested maize so that after 
360 h, mean rates were 0.3 ng/h/beetle and 37.7 ng/h/beetle, respectively. 
This result suggested that suppression of pheromone production was due to some chemical(s) 
left on the substrate by the live female beetles. The effect was highly reproducible, and different 
batches of previously-infested maize used during these experiments were always checked for the 
effect before use. Previously-infested maize was stored in a refrigerator at 4°C and no loss of effect 
was observed over periods of at least 4 months under these conditions. 
The above results (Fig. 4) showed that the suppression of pheromone production lasted for at 
least 360 h under continual aeration, indicating that this was not due to the presence of a highly 
volatile chemical. Similarly, aeration of previously-infested maize in a fume cupboard for 24 h failed 
to remove the effect. In an unreplicated experiment, pheromone production was measured from 
20 males alone on fresh maize, 20 males also alone on maize, but receiving air drawn from a similar 
jar containing 20 females on maize, and from 20 males and 20 females together on fresh maize. 
Rates of pheromone production after 72 h were 8.1 ng/h/beetle, 11.3 ng/h/beetle and 
SPR 32/2-F 
176 J. L. Smith er al. 
1.3 ng/h/beetle, respectively, also indicating that the chemical(s) responsible for suppression of 
pheromone production was not volatile. 
Eflect of antennectomy 
Rates of pheromone production by antennectomised m.ale beetles on previously-infested and 
fresh maize were compared. During the first 24 h of the experiment, mean rates of pheromone 
production were 1.64 ng/h/beetle and 23.63 ng/h/beetle on previously-infested maize and uninfested 
maize, respectively, and these means were signficantly different (P < 0.01; t = 7.20, 4 dfl. After 
72 h, mean rates were 2.53 ng/h/beetle and 34.52 ng/h/beetle, respectively, confirming that the 
material(s) responsible for suppression of pheromone production was not perceived by receptors 
on the antennae of the male beetles. 
Effects of solvent extraction and/or impregnation of the substrate 
In the first phase of this work, there was some indication that ether Soxhlet extraction of maize 
that had been previously infested with beetles of both sexes removed the material(s) responsible 
for suppression of pheromone production (Table 1, Expt l), but results were variable. Impregnation 
of clean maize with this ether extract did not transfer the suppression effect (Table 1, Expt 2). 
Methanol Soxhlet extraction of previously infested maize seemed to remove the suppression effect 
more reliably, but treatment of clean maize with this methanol extract did not transfer the effect 
either (Table 1, Expts 3 and 4). Subsequent experiments indicated that when either the ether or 
methanol extracts of previously-infested maize were impregnated into cassava chips, there was 
some suppression of pheromone production (Table 1, Expts 5 and 6). 
In the second phase of the work, it was confirmed that Soxhlet extraction of previously-infested 
maize successively with ether and methanol removed the suppression effect on pheromone 
production (Table 2, Expt 1). However, no significant suppression of pheromone production was 
observed when cassava chips were impregnated with either the ether or the methanol extracts 
(Table 2, Expts 2 and 3). Impregnation of cassava powder, cassava cubes or kibbled maize also 
gave no obvious suppression (Table 2, Expt 4). 
Soxhlet extraction of previously-infested maize with methanol alone removed most of the 
suppression effect on pheromone production (Table 3, Expt 1). Soxhlet extraction with hexane 
(Table 3, Expt l), dichloromethane (Table 3, Expt 2) or butanone (Table 3, Expt 3) did not remove 
the effect.

Considerable effort was put into determining whether the solution obtained by methanol Soxhlet 
extraction of previously infested maize could be used to transfer the suppression effect to another 
medium. Reapplying the methanol extract to the extracted maize or to cubed cassava did not 
reinstate the suppression effect. Similar results were obtained with the methanol extract after it had 
been washed with hexane to remove fatty material or fractionated by partition between ethyl 
acetate and water. The failure of efforts to transfer the material(s) responsible for suppression of 
pheromone production from one substrate to another by extraction and reimpregnation with 
methanol suggested that the Soxhlet extraction with methanol was extracting and/or destroying 
the material(s) responsible. Thus milder methods were explored. Although during the Soxhlet 
process the actual extraction occurs at temperatures well below the boiling point of methanol 
(65”(Z), the temperature is significantly above ambient. Extraction of previously-infested maize by 
stirring with methanol at room temperature did not remove the suppression effect (Table 4, Expts 
1 and 2), but extraction with methanol at room temperature with ultrasonic irradiation did 
(Table 4, Expts 3 and 4). Similarly, Soxhlet extraction with water also apparently removed the 
suppression effect (Table 4, Expt 4), although neither of these extracts caused suppression of 
pheromone production when impregnated on to previously-infested maize that had been Soxhlet 
extracted with methanol (Table 4, Expt 5). 
In these latter two experiments, pheromone production was inexplicably low on the batch of 
previously-infested maize that had been Soxhlet extracted with methanol.

DISCUSSION 
The experiments described here demonstrate clearly that production of aggregation pheromone 
by male P. truncatus is greatly reduced in the presence of conspecific female beetles. A similar effect 
is observed when the male beetles are placed on maize that was previously infested with males and 
females, but which contains no live beetles, suggesting that the suppression of pheromone 
production is due to some chemical residue produced by the live female beetles. The chemical(s) 
responsible is of low volatility, long-lived at room temperature or below and not detected by 
receptors on the antennae of the male beetles. 
However, attempts to extract the chemical(s) responsible for suppression of pheromone 
production and transfer it to a new substrate were unsuccessful. Soxhlet extraction of 
previously-infested maize with hexane, ether, dichloromethane or butanone apparently did not 
remove the suppression effect (Table 3). Soxhlet extraction with methanol removed the effect 
reproducibly, and Soxhlet extraction with water removed the effect in one experiment. In other 
single experiments, extraction of previously-infested maize by soaking in cold methanol did not 
remove the effect although extraction in cold methanol with ultrasonic irradiation did (Table 4). 
Early experiments (Table 1) indicated that pheromone production was suppressed when males 
were placed on cassava chips that had been impregnated with the methanol Soxhlet extract of 
previously-infested maize, but this could not be repeated subsequently using a variety of substrates 
(Tables 2 and 4). Impregnation of maize with ultrasonic methanol or water Soxhlet extracts of 
previously-infested maize also failed to suppress significantly pheromone production by males 
placed on the maize, although this was not tested with cassava (Table 4). 
Various substrates were evaluated for impregnation with the methanol Soxhlet extract of 
previously-infested maize. Even if the chemical(s) responsible for suppression of pheromone 
production was present in this extract, if this did not penetrate to the centre of the substrate during 
impregnation, male beetles boring into the substrate would not be subjected to its effect. Cassava 
was considered to be more absorbent than maize, but even when powdered cassava was used there 
was no suppression of pheromone production after impregnation (Table 2). A similar result was 
obtained when the maize from which the extract was obtained was used for reimpregnation. 
These results suggest that the chemical(s) responsible for suppression of pheromone production 
are extracted and/or destroyed by methanol or water, and not affected by the other solvents tested. 
It is unlikely that the chemical(s) is being destroyed by heat alone since Soxhlet extraction of 
previously-infested maize with butanone had no effect (Table 3) although the boiling point of 
Inhibition of pheromone production in P. rruncatus 179 
butanone (80°C) is higher than that of methanol (65°C). Both methanol and water are polar, 
nucleophilic solvents that could possibly hydrolyse ester or peptide bonds, for example, unlike the 
other solvents tested. Thus in future work, other polar, non-nucleophilic solvents might be 
investigated, for example acetonitrile or super-critical carbon dioxide. 
The suppression of male aggregation pheromone production by male P. truncutus in the presence 
of residues produced by conspecific females is apparently without precedent in other species and 
as yet its biological significance is not certain although the possible role of the pheromone and 
female factor in host selection behaviour has been discussed by Hodges (1994). 
Mating often causes a reduction in production of aggregation pheromone, for example in the 
scolytid beetles Dendroctonus brevicornis (LeConte) (Byers et al., 1984), Scolytus multistriatus 
(Marsham) (Gore et al., 1977) and Zps paraconfusus (Lanier) (Byers, 1981). At least in the last 
named species, this reduction in pheromone production appears to play a major role in terminating 
aggregation and limiting intraspecific competition for a finite food source. 
In other scolytids, compounds masking or inhibiting response to the aggregation pheromone may 
be released and serve a similar function. Thus pioneering female Dendroctonus pseudotsugae 
(Hopkins) release a multi-component aggregation pheromone which attracts conspecific male and 
female beetles. Sonic interactions between the sexes stimulate changes in both the quantity and 
quality of pheromone released, in particular increased production of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone 
inhibits response to the attractive pheromone components (Rudinsky et al., 1973). In D. 
brevicornis, the decline in pheromone production after mating is accompanied by an increase in 
the relative proportion of trans-verbenol in the blend which inhibits attraction (Byers et al., 1984). 
With Oryzuephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Cucujidae), White (1987) found that in a 
pit-fall bioassay both males and females were strongly attracted to a single male placed on maize 
14 days previously, but not to a single male and female. This may have been due to female residues 
inhibiting pheromone production by the male, but could equally well have been due to mating, 
or to production of attraction inhibitors or repellents by the female or young F, larvae. In R. 
dominica, a species closely related to P. truncatus, the presence of female beetles had no effect on 
the rate of production of pheromone by the males (Cork et al., 1991; Mayhew and Phillips, 1994). 
The effect of female-produced residues in suppressing pheromone production by male P. 
truncatus may thus be another, seemingly somewhat extreme, mechanism of limiting intra-specific 
competition for limited food sources, once males and females have been brought together to 
provide the minimum nucleus of a new colony. Thus, Fadamiro et al. (1996), concluded that flight 
activity was mainly a response to poor resource quality and increasing population density, and that 
the pheromone functions primarily as a resource location and colonisation signal. Reducing 
intraspecific competition may be more important in the original wood-boring habitat of P. 
truncatus (Helbig and Schulz, 1994) than in a grain store where food is relatively abundant and 
accessible. The suppression of pheromone production once the basis of a new colony has been 
established might also be responsible, at least in part, for the frequent observation that in two 
adjacent stores one can be heavily infested with P. truncatus while the other is uninfested, a 
phenomenon not common with other storage pests (Hodges, 1994). If pheromone production in 
the infested store continued, some of the beetles attracted into the vicinity might be expected to 
land on and infest adjacent stores. 
A further consideration is that a specific predator of P. truncatus, Teretriosoma nigrescens 
(Lewis) (Coleoptera: Histeridae), is strongly attracted to the aggregation pheromone of P. truncatus 
(Rees et al., 1991; Boeye et al., 1992; Helbig et al., 1992). There might thus be selection pressure 
to suppress pheromone production by male P. truncatus at the earliest opportunity once female 
beetles have arrived at the food source or when males enter localities where females have been or 
are in attendance. 
Little is known even about the site of production of the aggregation pheromone in P. truncatus. 
Hodges (1986) reported that no obvious glandular structures could be located by electron 
microscopy and suggested that the pheromone is produced in the gut and excreted with the frass, 
as is the case in many other boring beetles. Female residues might then require to be ingested by 
the male beetles before they can act to suppress pheromone production. Further investigations of 
the mechanisms of production of the aggregation pheromone by P. truncutus, and in particular 
of the dramatic effect of residues from conspecific females in suppressing pheromone production, 
180 J. L. Smith et al. 
should provide valuable insights into the processes involved in attack and colonisation of food 
sources by this pest and hence possible strategies for its control (Hodges, 1994).
