Abstract 
We developed a flexural-mode ultrasonic high-power transducer with a large diameter and a solid horn whose cross-sectional 
area changes continuously. This design method is based on general solutions of Timoshenko’s equation, which were derived by 
Miklowitz, for a straight bar vibrating in the flexural mode. Assessment of the transducer is carried out by a measurement of 
resonant frequency and a measurement of flexural vibration displacement distribution. The results of the measurements of a 
prototype 50 kHz transducer are fairly close to the required values. Furthermore, we tried to apply the 50 kHz transducer to 
ultrasonic plastics welding. As the result, we joined polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; Teflon) sheets of 0.4 mm in thickness.

1. Introduction 
In a recent study, we joined PTFE sheets of 
0.1-0.3 mm thickness using a 320 kHz longitudinal- 
mode ultrasonic transducer with a joining tip of 2.2 mm 
in diameter [l-3]. However, the diameter of the joining 
tip is very small in the high frequency range, because 
the diameter of the transducer is limited to a quarter of 
the longitudinal wavelength so that the tip will vibrate 
as a piston. 
Therefore, in this study, a flexural-mode transducer/ 
solid horn system with a large diameter is used to 
increase the diameter of the joining tip. The end face of 
the transducer can rub the face of PTFE sheets strongly. 
As a result, the temperature rise caused by the rubbing 
is high enough to enable joining. Softened PTFE sheets 
are joined by strong static pressure supplied vertically. 
Since the low frequency transducer has a large body, 
the transducer is not damaged by the static pressure. 
However, it is very difficult to analyse a flexural-mode 
solid horn whose cross-sectional area changes con- 
tinuously. Therefore, we propose a new design method 
for a flexural-mode solid horn.

2.1. Construction of the transducer system 
Fig. 1 shows the construction of the new transducer 
system. The system consists of three components: trans- 
ducer, horn and tool. It is important that the transducer 
and tool are straight bars, and that both ends of 
the horn are connected to the transducer and tool at the 
loop points of flexural-mode vibration. Therefore, the 
boundary condition of the horn is loop-loop. Under 
this condition, the flexural-mode vibration displacement 
distribution is denoted by a cosine function. Therefore, 
the analysis of the horn becomes very simple. 
The flexural-mode vibration is generated by four 
piezoelectric ceramics cut in the shape of half-rings.

These piezoelectric ceramics, polarized in the thickness 
direction, are placed at the loop point of the vibration, 
and are set facing away from each other, as shown in 
Fig. 1. When an alternating voltage is supplied to the 
ceramics, upper ceramics and lower ceramics begin 
alternately to dilate and shrink in opposite directions. 
Thereby, the bending moment which excites flexural- 
mode vibration is generated. 
2.2. Design method of the part of the transducer and the 
tool [4,5] 
As shown in Fig. 1, the transducer and tool are 
designed under the free-loop boundary condition. The 
solution of the frequency equation under this condition 
has been derived by Miklowitz from Timoshenko’s 
equation, as follows [6]

method. Fig. 3 shows the numerical solutions of Eq. (1).

2.3. Design method of thejlexurabmode solid horn [7] 
Under the loop-loop boundary condition, a displace- 
ment distribution function y(x) of a straight bar, which 
vibrates in the flexural-mode, is represented simply by a 
cosine function as 
Y(X) = (1 + &)C2 cos(ln&), (2) 
where C, is a constant representing the displacement 
amplitude. If the resonant frequency is given, the 
diameter of the bar depends only on the wave-number 
In,l. Therefore, the change of the length of the bar 
according to the change of the diameter of the bar can 
be calculated using the iteration method shown in Fig. 4. 
First, we consider the straight bar and represent the 
value of )n2( for the diameter di as 111~1~. If the diameter

changes stepwise at x = 6,, the phase angle for 6, is 
In,!&. Therefore, the phase angle of the rest of the bar 
is In,l,(& - 6,). 1, is obtained from 1~1~. Next, if the 
diameter changes stepwise at x = 6, + bZ, then the value 
of 1, is obtained in the same manner. The values of 6, 
must be small enough not to change the bending moment 
and shear force at every step. If the method is iterated 
according to the change of the diameter, the length of 
the horn can be found. If the diameters of the horn ends 
are given, adjustment of the diameters is needed so that 
both the ends satisfy the loop-loop boundary condition. 
The change of the vibration distribution due to the 
change of the diameter is obtained as follows. The kinetic 
energy T of the loop point of the bar is 
T= $4u” s Eh 
cos(lnzlx) dx = 2npAv2& 
-Eh ,n2, 
where A is the cross-sectional area, v is vibration velocity, 
I is the wavelength of the flexural-mode vibration and 
E is a constant of very small value [S]. If the energy T 
is constant for x, u(x) is proportional to (ln21/A(x))“2. 
Considering the phase angle of the vibration, we can 
represent the displacement distribution u(x) as {weight 
function x cos(phase angle)}. As the result, u(x) is 
u(x) = a(xYw = ~oCf~~l~zl,>l~~~~~l~zl~~1”2 cos(l~zlx4 
(4) 
where subscripts 0 and x represent the values at the 
large diameter side end, and at x, respectively. 
2.4. Fabrication of the transducer system 
A flexural-mode transducer system is fabricated 
under the following conditions. (1) Resonant frequency 
f0 = 50 kHz. (2) Diameter of the transducer do = 20 mm 
and diameter of the tool d, = 5 mm. (3) The vibration 
mode of the transducer is sixth-mode and the vibration 
mode of the tool is first-mode. (4) The thickness of the 
PZT ceramics is 4 mm, including an electrode plate. 
(5) The shape of the horn is exponential for smooth 
connection to the tool. The area of the horn A(x) is 
represented by A(x) = A0 exp(-yx), where A0 is the area 
of large side. The length of the horn is 3n(rad) equivalent. 
The diameter of the transducer-side end of the horn is 
20 mm (the same as the transducer) and the diameter of 
the tool side end of the horn is 5 mm (the same as the 
tool). (6) The material of transducer body, tool and 
horn is aluminium alloy (A2024) and the piezoelectric 
ceramic is MT-18 (PZT4 equivalent). Table 2 shows 
the material constants for the design. 
From the iteration procedure described above, the 
taper constant y is obtained as 0.534, and the length 
of the horn is 51.89 mm. Since jodo = 100 kHz cm, 
f& = 639.53 kHz cm from Fig. 3. After correction of the 
transducer length due to the insertion of piezoelectric 
ceramics, the transducer length 1, becomes 121.45 mm. Table 2

Since f,,d, = 25 kHz cm, fOl, = 50.18 kHz cm. Therefore, 
the tool length 1, is 10.04 mm. 
Fig. 5 shows the fabricated transducer system and its 
flexural-mode vibration displacement measured by a 
laser-Doppler interferometer. Fig. 6 shows the admit- 
tance locus of the transducer system under the no-load 
condition. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the vibration of 
the transducer system is in good agreement with the 
theoretical values. In Fig. 5, which is the right-hand side 
of the transducer, the horn and tool are fabricated as 
one component. This component and the other com- 
ponents are connected by an inner bolt.

Fig. 8. SEM image of cross-section of a joined part where the 
thickness of the PTFE sheet is 0.4 mm. The specimen is joined under 
the following conditions; static pressure is 70 N, vibration displacement 
of the tip is 20 urn,, and joining time is 1 s. 
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the transducer is attached to the 
inside of a hollow cylindrical case by four screws at the 
nodal points of flexural-mode vibration. The case is 
connected to an air cylinder by means of a flange. The 
air cylinder is used to supply suitable static pressure to 
PTFE sheets placed on the anvil. The tool end, that is 
the joining tip, is ground to a convex shape to avoid 
cutting of PTFE sheets by the edge of the tip. The 
diameter of the joining tip is 5 mm. The anvil is a steel 
block of 25 mm in thickness. Fig. 8 shows an example of the cross-sectional view 
of the joints of two thicknesses of PTFE sheets 0.4 mm 
thick. The driving frequency is 50 kHz. Note that no 
preprocesses, such as chemical or physical processes, are 
required in ultrasonic PTFE joining; however, light 
wiping of PTFE faces was carried out in order to 
maintain a uniform joining condition. As shown in 
Fig. 8, it is clearly seen that two PTFE sheets are joined 
completely, because there is no boundary in the joined 
part. 
4. Conclusions 
A new design procedure for a flexural-mode/solid- 
horn system with a one-dimensional construction has 
been described. Using this procedure, we designed and 
fabricated a 50 kHz transducer with a large diameter. 
The resonant frequency is fairly close to the required 
value of 50 kHz. 
Moreover, we confirmed that the transducer system 
is suitable for ultrasonic joining by exchanging the 
conventionally used longitudinal-mode transducer for 
the new transducer.
