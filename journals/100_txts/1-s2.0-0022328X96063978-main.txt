Abstract 
The preparation of a series of immobilized transition-metal catalysts are reported. The catalysts were obtained by chemisorption of 
either rhodium(I) or iridium(l) complexes [MX(C2H4)2] . (M - Rh, In X -- CI, OAc, acac, f3-acac, f6-acac) on SiO 2 or MgO supports. 
The oxides were also activated by SiCI4 or TiCI,, to give support materials in which the acidic nature of the surface is substantially 
increased. The activity of the immobilized catalysts was tested, particularly in the reaction of ethene with diphenyldiazomethane which 
yields a mixture of I.l-diphenylpropene (8) and l.l-diphenylc~,clopropane (9). it was found that the most active and most selective 
(highest ratio 8:9) catalyst BI was formed from support material B (SiO2 activated by SiCi4) and [RhCI(C2H,,)2] 2 (I) and that both the 
activity and selectivity of BI was comparable with that of complex 1 in solution, in contrast, the supported catalysts A2, D2 and A3, D3 
obtained from [Rh(OAcXC. H4)212 (2) and [Rh(acacXC2H4)2] (3) were less active than compounds 2 and 3 in solution. The immobilized 
catalysts A6. AT, D7 and E7, which were generated from the chloro- and acetatoiridium(i) complexes [irCI(C2H4)212 (6) and 
[ir(OAcXC2H4)2] 2 (7), possessed a lower activity than the rhodium counterparts. With diazoalkanes other than Ph2CN 2, the activity of 
the supported catalyst BI was partly higher and partly lower than that of complex 1 in the homogeneous phase.

1. Introduction 
In the course of investigations with the aim of 
preparing square-planar carbenerhodium(I) complexes 
of the type trans.[RhCl(---CRR')(PtPr~)2] from 
[RhCi(PtPr3)2]2 and diazoalkanes, we recently observed 
that a rhodium-catalysed reaction between ethene and 
diphenyidiazomethane occurs which surprisingly yields 
instead of the expected l.l-diphenylcyclopropane the 
isomeric i. I-diphenylpropene [1,2]. During the continu- 
:+tion of these studies it was found that (I) 
bis(olefin)rhodium(1) compounds, such as 
[RhCI(C 2 H,,)2 ]2 and [RhCI(CsH t4)z ]2, are catalytically 
much more reactive than [RhCi(P'Pr3)2]2 or similar 
phosphinerhodium derivatives, and (2) in compounds of 
general composition [RhX(CzH 4)2 ],, the anionic ligand 
X- has a crucial influence on the catalytic activity.

i Dedicated to the late Professor Hidemasa Takaya, in recognition 
of his pioneering contributions to organometallic chemistry and 
homogeneous catalysis. While [RhCI(C2H+)2] 2 (1) (see Scheme I) is quite 
active and provides turnover numl~rs of about 250 [3], 
the related rhodium acetylacetonate [Rh(acacXC2 H +)2 ] 
(3) is rather inert. Upon reaction with C2H+/Ph2CN2 
in benzene at 40°(2, it aces not induce the formation of 
I.I-diphenylpropene but instead, and rather slowly, that 
of l.l-diphenylcyclopropane (dinuclear rhodium(ll) 
complexes are excellent catalysts for the preparation of 
cyclopropanes from olefins and diazoalkanes; see Ref. 
[4]). With the acetato complex [Rh(~I2-O2CCH3) - 
(C2H4)212 (2), in methylcyclohexane at 40°C, turnover 
numbers of about 80 have been achieved, the dominat- 
ing coupling product, however, being I.l-diphenyl- 
cyclopropane [5]. 
Taking these results into consideration, we have now 
attached compounds 1, 2 and 3, as well as the trifluoro- 
and hexafluoroacetylacetonato complexes 4 and 5, to 
appropriate inorganic support materials. In earlier stud- 
ies [6], we had confirmed that both the chloro complex 
I and the bis(cyclooctene)rhodium(1) counterpart 
[RhCI(CsH t4)212 can be immobilized on SiO 2 or A120 3 
to give supported catalysts for the reaction shown in Eq.

thor group at one of the ligands is a common way of 
generating immobilized catalysts [6-8], catalytically 
more active materials were obtained by chemisorption 
of compounds such as 1 or 3 on silica or magnesium 
oxide. Both oxides were pretreated at 180°C and 
10- ~ mbar to form partially dehydroxylated silica (pds) 
and partially dehydroxylated magnesia (pdm), as shown 
in Scheme 2. Moreover, these supports were also treated 
with Lewis acids such as SiC! a or TiCI4 in order to 
increase the acidic nature of the oxide surface. We 
assume that during this pretreatment various hydroxy 
groups on the surface are transformed to ([Ox]- 
O),ECI4_ , units (n = 1-4, E ~ Si, Ti); simultaneously 
n equivalents of gaseous HCI are formed. Support mate- 
rials (like F in Scheme 2) which ate completely coveted 
with [(SiO,)~OECI,]-moieties (E ~ Si, Ti) were ob- 
tained by the initial deprotonation of the surflLce SiOl, l

groups with "BuLi and subsequent reaction of the lithi- 
ated oxide surface with ECI4. 
The preparation of the immobilized rhodium cata- 
lysts (Scheme 3) took place by adding a solution of the 
corresponding complex 1-5 in hexane to a suspension 
of the support material in the same solvent and shaking 
the resulting caixture under l atm of ethene. Both the 
nature of the support and the anionic iigand X- of the 
complex determine the rate and degree of chemisorption 
on the surface. It is generally known that tile reaction 
between an organo-transition metal compound, which 
contains a basic anionic iigand (which may be proto- 
nated) and an oxide support is crucially dependent on 
the basicity, the number of surface-hydroxy groups and 
the size of the patlicles [9-12]. 
The results summarized in Table ! illustrate that on 
treatment of pds (support material A) with 1 only parts 
(ca. 20%) of the chlororhodiuna(I) complex are ab- 
sorbed. A significantly higher amount of 1 (ca. 33c;; ~) is 
I~und to tl~e surface of support material B which is 
formed by pretreatment of pds with SiCI4. if, however, 
tile related support material E (obtained from pdnl and 
SiCI~) is used the yield of chemisorbed I is increased to 
76%. 
An even higher percentage of dissolved rhodium can 
be absorbed at the surface of oxide supports A, B, C or 
D if, instead of the chloro derivative 1, the correspond- 
ing acetato or acetylacetonato complexes 2-5 are em- 
ployed. From previous work by Schwartz and cowork- 
ers [101 and Basset and coworkers [I i] it was already 
known that a quantitative reaction of compounds such 
as [Rh(lq'LC.~Hs).~] and SiO 2 occurs which is promoted 
by the facile protonation of an allyl ligand to lbrm 
propene. In the same way, the complexes 2-5 also react 
smoothly with A-D to give supported catalysts A2-D2 
containing all of the rhodium present in the precursor 
compound. Only on treatment of D with 3 and of E 
with 2 or 3, is the rhodium complex not quantitatively 
absorbed. The inorganic material F, in which all the 
surface SiOH groups are replaced by SiOECI3 (E = Si, 
Ti) traits, is almost incapable of reacting with one of the 
rhodium(1) compounds [RhX(CEH4)2],,; less than 10% 
of 1, 2 or 3 can be immobilized on this support. 2.2, Catalytic reactions of ethene and diazoalkanes 
Following the preparation of materials AI-E3, these 
species were tested as catalysts for the C-C coupling 
reaction between ethene and dipheny}diazomethane at 
40 and 60°C. As shown in Table 1, in nearly all 
reactions both of the isomeric products 8 and 9 were 
generated. We note if, at although complex 1 up to now 
is the most efficient and most selective catalyst in 
solution [1,3], the catalytic activity of the immobilized 
compounds AI and DI, which are prepaxed from 1 and 
pds or pdm, is the lowest in the series of supported 
catalysts. These species AI and DI are also not selec- 
tive. With regard to this observation, it is really aston- 
ishing that BI, formed by treatment of B with the 
chloro complex 1, at 60°C is the most active (TON = 
184) and at 40°C the most selective catalyst among the 
immobilized species used in this work. 
The catalysts A2 and D2, which were obtained by 
chemisorption of 2 on the oxide supports, are less active 
in the reaction of ethene and diphenyldiazomethane than 
the acetato complex 2 in the homogeneous phase [5]. 
The same observation has been made with the acetyl- 
acetonato-derived species A3 and D3. ?,s fat" as A3 is 
concerned, the difference in comparison with the be- 
haviour of compound 3 in solution is, that with A3 at 
60°C a i:1 mixture of 8 and 9 is generated, while in the 
homogeneous phase only the cyclopropane derivative 9 
is formed [13]. It is important to note that the activity of 
the supported catalysts obtained with complexes 2 and 3 
increased if the support material was pretrcated with 
SiCI4 or TiCI.,. Moreover, it is quite remarkable dlat tile 
amount of the olefin 8 in the product mixture is higher 
lor C2 (pretreated with "l'iCl.~) than for B2 (pretrcated 
with Si(?! 4) and equally higher fc)r C4 and C5 than Ibr 
B4 and B$ (see Table I). 
In order to find out whether Lewis-acidic units, 
which are present on the surface of catalysts BlooB5 or 
El-E3, also promote the catalytic activity of 
bis(ethene)rhodium(l) complexes in solution, the reac- 
tion of C,I-! 4 and Ph,CN, was investigated in toluene 
at 40°C with complex I as the catalyst in the presence 
of HCI, Me3SiCI and SiCla. The results (see Table 2) 
reveal, however, that the turnover numbers as well as 
the ratio of 8:9 decre:ises if one of the Lewis acids is

added to 1. The reason for the decreased activity possi- 
bly is that from 1 and RX (R = H, SiMea, SiC! 3) higher 
coordinated rhodium compounds are formed as interme- 
diates in which the interaction of the olefin and the 
diazoalkane with the metal centre is inhibited. 
The effect of the temperature on the catalytic reac- 
tion of CzH 4 and PhzCN 2 is illustrated in Table 3. 
While in solution (methyicyclohexane, toluene, ace- 
tone) the largest turnover numbers were found at 40 °C 
[3°5]° the highest activity of catalyst BI is observed at 
70"C. As far as the optimum yield of the olefin 8 is 
concerned, a lower temperature than 70°C is preferred 
and, therefore, if combining the two aspects (activity 
and selectivity) a reaction temperature of 50°C seems to 
be best. It should be emphasized, however, that al- 
though at 50"C the TON value for BI is somewhat 
lower than for complex 1 in soiution, the great advan- 
tage by using the supported catalyst is the ease of 
isolation of the olefinic product. 
We were also interested in comparing the activity of 
catalyst BI (in heterogeneous phase) and complex I (in 
homogeneous phase) in the reaction of ethene with 
dia~oalkane derivatives other them Ph ~CN~. The results, 
which at~ shown in Fig. I, at'e quite remarkable, and, 
depending on the substituents R and R', do not always 
point in the same direction, In some cases (for R ~ Ph 
and R'- Ph, Me, CH~Ph) the activity is higher under 
heterogeneous conditions while in others (for R ~ R' 
p ~ Tol, p~Anis) the turnover numbers in solution ex- 
ceed by far those obtained with the supported catalyst. 
The immot)ilization of the iridium(1) complexes [IrX(C2H4)_~] r (6, 7)(see Scheme 1) occurred similarly 
to that of the rhodium counterparts I and 2. As inor- 
ganic supports, the oxidic materials A, I) and E were 
used which on treatment with 6 and 7 gave the catalysts 
A6, A7, D7 and E7 respectively. The results which 
have been obtained with these immobilized catalysts in 
the reaction of C2H 4 and PhECN 2 are summarized in 
Table 4. In general, the conclusion is that the activity of 
the two iridium(1) complexes cannot be increased by 
chemisorption on the chosen inorganic supports. As far 
as the selectivity is concerned, the only difference be- 
tween the reactions in solution and in the heterogeneous 
phase ts that while the acetato compound 7 in methylcy- 
clohexane at 40°(2 favours the formation of 9 (ratio 
8:9 = !:9) [5], the olefin 8 is the major product with the 
supported catalyst E7. Under both conditions (homoge- 
neous and heterogeneous), the turnover numbers for 7 
and E7 are about the same. 
2.2.1. Concluding remarks 
The present study has shown that although the immo- 
bilized catalysts containing rhodium or iridium as the 
active metal have the advantage of ease of product 
separation and isolation, in the reaction of ethene with 
diphenyldiazomethane they are less selective than the 
respective bis(ethene)rhodium(1) and -iridium(l) com- 
plexes in the homogeneous phase. The reason for the 
decreased selectivity probably originates neither in the 
type of inorganic support nor in the natu,~ of the anion 
X= of the precursor compounds [MX(Ca !t.t) ~],, (M 
Rh, lr: X ~ CI. OAc, aeac, fcacac, f~oaeac) since dur- 
ing the preparation of the catalysts HX is Ibrmed and 
quickly removed from the surfitce. The question of 
whether the r.~tio of olefin:cyclopropane can be in- 
creased by further modifying the oxide support is 
presently difficult to answer. As some preliminary ex- 
periments have indicated, however, an increase of activ- 
ity seems to be possible, in particular by anchoring 
cationic olefinrhodium and -iridium complexes to the 
inorganic support.

3. Experimental tl:tails 
All reactions were carried out under ,argon using 
Schlenk tube techniques. Solvents were dried by stan- 
dard procedures prior to use. Ethene was purchased 
from commercial suppliers and used without further 
purification. The starting materials [RhCI(C 2 H 4)2 ]2 (1) 
[14], [Rh(O2CCH3)(C2H4)2]2 (2) [5], [Rh(acac)- 
(C:,H4) 21 (3) [i5], [Rh(f3-acac)(C2H4)2] (4) [16] and 
[Rh(f6-acac)(C2H4):,] (5) [17], [IrCI(C2H4)2] 2 (6) [18] 
and [h(O2CCH3)(C2H4).,]:~ (7) [5] were prepared as 
described in the literature. 
Silica (Merck, Kieselgel 60, 0.2-0.5 mm diameter) 
and magnesium oxide (Merck, heavy, powder) were 
pretreated at 180 °C and 10-a mbar for 14 h. The con- 
tent of hydroxyl-groups was determined by th~ method 
of 7~rewitinov with CHaMgl in anisol in a modified 
apparatus described in Ref. [19]. The (Si,Mg-OH)-con- 
tent was found to be 1.8mmol(OH)g~t (pds, A) and 
2.3 mmol(OH)g ~l (Ixhn, D) (see Scheme 2). 
NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on 
Bruker AC 200 instruments. GC-MS analyses were 
caiTied out using an liP GCD 1800A system with an 
electron ionisation (El) detector. 
3.1. Prelmration of the support material B 
A suspension of 6.65 g of silica A in 15 mi of hexane 
was treated with 1.45ml (12.7retool) of SiCI 4. The 
resulting mixture was shaken at room temperature for 
2 h (until the formation of gaseous HC! subsided). The 
solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with 
portions of 10 ml of pentane until the washings were pH 
neutral. The product was dried in vacuo. 
3.2. Preparation of the support material C 
A suspension of 7.79 g of silica A in 20 ml of hexane 
was treated with 1.62ml (14.8retool) of TiCI 4. The 
resulting mixture was shaken at room temperature for 
2 h (until the formation of gaseous HCI subsided). The 
solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with 
portions of 10 ml of pentane until the washings were pH 
neutral. The product was dried in vacuo. 3.3. Preparation of the support material E 
A suspension of 1.49g of magnesium oxide D in 
10ml of hexane was treated with 4470,! (3.90mmol) of 
SiCi 4. The resulting mixture was shaken at room tem- 
perature for 2h (until the formation of gaseous HCI 
subsided). The solvent was removed and the residue 
was extracted with portions of 10 ml of pentane until the 
washings were pH neutral. The product was dried in 
vacuo. 
3.4. Preparation of the support material F 
A suspension of 2.10g of silica A in 10ml of hexane 
was treated with 1.51 ml (3.78 mmol) of a 2.5 N solution 
of "BuLl in hexane and shaken for 30min at room 
temperature. The solvent was removed and the residue 
extracted twice with portions of 10ml of hexane. The 
resulting solid was suspended in 10ml of hexane ,rod 
treated with 4300,1 (3.78 retool)of SiCI4. The re:~ulting 
mixture was shaken at room temperature for 2h. The 
solvent was removed and the residue was extracted six 
times with portions of 10mi of ether to remove LiCI. 
The product was dried in vacuo. 
3.5. General procedure jbr the preparation of the catao 
lysts 
Under an atmosphere of ethene, a suspension of 
2.00 g of suppotl material A-F in 10ml of hexane was 
treated with a solution of either 1-5 (0.194 mmol Rh) or 
6-7 (0.104 mmoi Ir) in 15 mi of hexane. The mixture 
was shaken at loom temperature under a pressure of 
i atm ethene for 2 h. The solvent was removed and the 
residue washed three times with 20ml of pentane. The 
solid was dried in vacuo. 
3.6. Procedure for the catalytic reaction of ethene with 
diphenyldiazomethane with supported catalysts 
To a suspension of 150 mg of the immobilized cata- 
lyst in 6 ml of methylcyclohexane at either 40 or 60°C 
(using BI as catalyst also at 50, 70 and 80°C) a solution 

186 M.E. Schneider et al./Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 520 (1996) 181-186 
(0.1 M) of diphenyldiazomethane in methylcyclohexane 
was added dropwise whiie bubbling ethene through the 
suspension. The catalytic reaction was finished when 
the violet colour of the diazoalkane solution did not 
disappear upon addition to the reaction mixture. The 
solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue dissolved 
in a small amount of hexane. In order to destroy the 
excess of diphenyldiazomethane and separate the reac- 
tion products from the catalyst, the mixture was filtered 
over AI203 (neutral, activity grade HI, height of column 
3 cm). The eluate gave after evaporation of the solvent 
either a white solid (l.l-diphenylpropene) or an oil 
(mixture of l.l-diphenylpropene and l.l-diphenyl- 
cyclopropane). The ratio of products was determined by 
integration of the characteristic signals in the ~H NMK 
spectra and by GC analysis. 
3.7. Procedure for the catalytic reaction in the presence 
of HCI. SiCl, or (CH~)3 SiCl 
A solution of 10mg (0.026mmol) of 1 in 6ml of 
toluene at 40°C was treated either with a solution 
(0.05 M) of HC! in toluene, SiC! 4 or (CH.~)3SiC! while 
bubbling ethene through the solution. The following 
catalytic reaction was done as described in Section 3.6. 
3.8. Procedure for the catalytic reaction of ethene with 
d~'erem diazoalkanes 
To a suspension of 150rag of BI in 6ml of toluene 
at 50°C a solution (0.1 M) of diazoalkane (see Fig. !) in 
toluene was added dropwise while bubbling ethene 
through the suspension. The catalytic refection A, as fin- 
ished when the violet colour of the diazoalkane solution 
did not disappear upon addition to the ~action mixture. 
The mixture was worked up as described in Section 3.6. 
The ratio of cyclopropane to the olefin derivatives was 
determined by integration of the charactet'istic sign~*~Is in 
the t H NMR spectra.
