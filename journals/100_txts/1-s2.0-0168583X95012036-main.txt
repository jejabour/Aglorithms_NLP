Abstract 
First results of the application of Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) to the analysis of heavy metals content 
in aerosol samples are described. Procedures of sample collection, preparation, and measurement are characterized with 
respect to the main instrumental demands. At this stage of development, RBS looks promising with respect to other 
established analytical methods. The presently achieved sensitivity of about lo’* at/cm2 is already satisfying but can be 
further enhanced by at least one order of magnitude by using a Si multidetector array instead of a single device. 
1. Introduction 
Increasing interest in air quality problems is one of the 
stimulating factors for the development of sensitive analyt- 
ical methods suitable for tracing the pollutants. One pollu- 
tant group of considerable current interest, treated in the 
present paper, are certain heavy metals incorporated in 
atmospheric aerosols. In conjunction with the recom- 
mended European emission limits our selection has been 
focused to elements of predominantly anthropogeneous 
origin: V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. 
Many analytical methods are routinely used in trace 
element analysis. Fig. 1 shows the impurity detection 
limits of some typical methods. RBS is a well established 
analytical method with most applications in the area of 
few-component systems, such as depth profiling of heavy 
dopants (high Z) in light (low Z) matrices. The capabili- 
ties of RBS as a tool for very sensitive multi-element 
analysis have been exploited much less, the reason being 
that mass resolution of RBS is lower than with other mass 
spectrometric techniques. 
The principles of RBS analysis are well documented 
and can be found elsewhere [ 11. Also its standard uses and 
limitations and comparison of it to other methods have 
been reviewed several times together in comparison with 
other methods [2-lo]. As stated above, in general RBS is 
used as a high-resolution depth microscope rather than a 
mass spectrometer of medium quality.

e-mail cklatt@zooey.mpi-hd.mpg.de. The use of RBS and NRA (Nuclear Reaction Analysis) 
in the analysis of light elements in aerosols as methods 
complementary to PIXE (Proton Induced X-ray Emission) 
has been reported [I 1,141 with the verdict “they can 
hardly be performed on particulate matter collected on 
standard filters commonly used for PIXE analyses” [ 111. 
Only recently it was shown [12] that due to the improve- 
ment of experimental apparatus it is possible to use RBS 
for analysis of trace amounts of heavy impurities on/in 
light substrates. RBS is an absolute method detecting 
impurities in solids at levels of typically 10’2-10’4 at/cm* 
IO-lOO-fold lower area1 concentrations, however, can be 
measured when special instrumentation is used. It is clear 
that its application should provide valid results at least 
complementing, if not surpassing, other methods in certain 
respects. It is the aim of this first attempt to find out how 
successfully RBS can be applied to the multielement anal- 
ysis of atmospheric aerosols. Again, of utmost importance 
in this context is the relative mass resolution m/Am 
which can be optimized by proper choice of the analysis 
conditions as there are: incident particle mass and energy, 
and detector type. 
2. Sample preparation 
Considering the practical aspects of RBS analysis it is 
clear that several problems imposed specifically by aerosol 
geometry have to be solved in order to obtain reliable 
results. To this end two main limitations - surface rough- 
ness and beam resistance of the filters - have to be 
overcome.

[12]; TRFA = total relection X-ray fluorescence analysis, figures

2.1. Sample surface topography 
To apply RBS analysis to aerosol samples on standard 
fibre filters is practically impossible. Therefore special 
filters without surface texture have to be used. Based on 
the experience with PIXE measurements Nuclepore mem- 
brane filters were chosen because of their low-Z composi- 
tion, only H, C and 0, high purity and reported resistance 
to the ion beam exposure [ 11,131. 
Aerosols are microscopic particles of markedly lower 
density than bulk material with typical dimensions of 
about 0.1-10 pm [ 14,151 strongly deviating from the flat 
surface topography ideal for RBS. To alleviate conditions 
for RBS analysis size-resolved sampling of aerosol parti- 
cles is absolutely necessary. 
Another factor that could cause a problem is the amount 
of the material collected on separate filters. A theoretical 
treatment of nonuniform layers based on the simple model 
of spheres of varying size on a flat substrate [l] describes 
the actual case situation of aerosol particles on a Nucle- 
pore filter reasonably well. According to this model, the 
degree of particle accumulation, and thus the correspond- 
ing RBS spectra, can be divided into three categories, as 
illustrated in Fig. 2. 
1) The most difficult case arises from integral sampling 
when too much material on a single filter is collected. The resulting bulk spectra can be evaluated only, if the concen- 
tration of the interesting elements is sufficiently high - at 
least of the order of a few atomic percent. 
2) When the particles on a single filter surface form 
one monolayer or less, the RBS spectra will feature asym- 
metric peaks with low-energy tails. The shape of the tails 
depends on particle geometry and individual peaks are 
usually superimposed on top of each other. 
3) In the case, where a stack unit of several filters is 
used, the best conditions are met when the lower stages 
exhibit a low surface coverage with particles of similar 
size. Then the corresponding RBS spectra approach least 
overlap conditions for the individual impurity peaks. This 
is of course strongly dependent on the mass distribution of 
the traced elements and on the energy resolution of the 
RBS set-up as well. 
The last two thin film conditions are suitable for quanti- 
tative evaluation as the peak integrals are in most practical 
cases proportional to the respective elemental or isotopic 
areal concentration. 
2.2. Radiation resistance 
In many laboratories ion beam analysis of air-pollution 
samples is carried out by PIXE. It is accepted practice to 
expose aerosol filters with collected particles directly to 
the analyzing ion beam without any sample pre-treatment. 
Most of the PIXE installations use defocused ion beams

with beam spots of about 1 cm*. Moreover, thin diffusor 
foils are often used to achieve broad flat beam profiles. 
Both large beam spots and diffusor foils are unacceptable 
for RBS because of a loss in energy and mass resolution. 
As measurements with too intense focused ion beams 
cause destruction of the filter material, the analyzing 4He 
ion beam had to be kept at a maximum current density 
level of the order of 10 nA/cm2. Due to the considerably 
higher stopping power of He ions of similar energy as 
protons the corresponding energy deposit in a filter mate- 
rial is much more critical. The concomitant structural 
changes lead to embrittlement and mechanical stress in the 
exposed layer, and eventually to filter rupture etc. In order 
to prevent this well-sticking mechanical support is neces- 
sary. It was found that filters backed with an approxi- 
mately 800 nm Al layer can withstand 4He+ ion beams up 
to current densities of 1 kA/cm2 for periods of the order 
of hours. 
3. Experimental 
To fulfil the conditions for backscattering spectrometry, 
as described in Section 2.1, a simple holder for stacking 
filters was constructed for aerosol sampling. At the begin- 
ning, for safe and convenient manipulation of the samples 
throughout the whole process, each filter was attached to a 
metal ring covered with a rubber coating. All manipula- 
tions, such as pumping, metallization, measurement, etc., 
were then done using these holders. 
As the experiments presented here were carried out for 
the development of the analytical method rather than for 
real aerosol research, only two filters with pore sizes of 1 
and 0.1 pm were placed in the stacking filter unit. The 
filters used were Nuclepore Polycarbonate Membranes 13 
mm in diameter. The active sampling area was 50 mm2; 
only one fifth of it, however, was used for analysis. The 
stacking filter unit was operated at a flow rate of 0.7 
l/min. It was found that approximately 8 hours of sam- 
pling were sufficient for collecting enough material for the 
RBS analysis. The SEM photograph (Fig. 3) of a sample 
prepared under the above conditions shows a very low 
coverage of the filter surface which satisfies our model 
assumptions of Fig. 2c. 
The back sides of the filter samples were coated with 
700-900 nm thick Al layers. The metallization was per- 
formed in a standard electron gun evaporation unit. The 
layer growth rate varied between 5 to 10 rim/s,, the 
vacuum during the evaporation was kept at 10d3 Pa. Then 
the aerosol samples were measured with 1, 2 and 3 MeV 
4He ion beams at the RBS station installed in the 25” line 
of the 3 MV Pelletron tandem accelerator at the Max- 
Planck-Institut fir Kemphysik [ 161. All samples were mea- 
sured under conditions of normal incidence, 160” backscat- 
tering angle, and 0.8 msr solid angle subtended by a single 
Si detector. The average analyzing beam current was 30 Fig. 3. SEM photograph of a 1.0 pm Nuclepore filter with

nA into a beam spot of about 0.1 cm2. The detector had an 
energy resolution of 12 keV FWHM [ 171. 
For the determination of the sensitivity of the RBS 
measurements a set of metallized filters and Si substrates 
was implanted with 2 keV Pb, Ag and V ions with areal 
doses from 10” to lOr4 ions/cm2. The implanted samples 
were measured under the same conditions as the aerosol 
filters. 
4. Results and discussion 
Prior to any evaluation, the material of the unexposed 
filters was checked (Fig. 4a). In the interesting mass 
region, between about 50 and 208 amu, only a contamina- 
tion around m = 50 + 1 amu was found so that no other 
background corrections should be necessary. Similar re- 
sults were also reported in Ref. ill], where Cr was de- 
tected by PIXE. Spectra of the clean filter implanted with 
2 keV lOI Pb ions/cm2 (Fig. 4b) and the real aerosol 
sample (Fig. 4c) compare the contamination level with the 
expected heavy metal signal. Note that in the single pile-up 
regime, between about channels 180-360, some back- 
ground varying with the actual count rates is present. A 
novel technique of reducing this kind of pile-up from a 
light substrate will be published elsewhere [ 181. 
RBS spectra were taken with various combinations of 
places, sampling time, air flow etc. Typical example of the 
measured spectra from the upper and lower stage of the 
stacking filter unit are shown in Fig. 5. The influence of

the analyzing beam energy on the measured spectra is 
documented in Fig. 6. 
Already these first results demonstrate that RBS can 
very well be applied to the elemental analysis of aerosols, 
where some specific advantages may be noted: 
- absolute method - no need for calibrated standards; 
_ increasing sensitivity for heavier elements; 
- isotopic resolution of elements; 
- no further physico-chemical preparation steps on the 
as-collected sample. 
The present procedure, however, is still far from opti- 
mum performance utilizing all RBS advantages. The actual

energy choice must take into account competing require- 
ments imposed by particle size, sensitivity and mass reso- 
lution. This is clearly illustrated by measurements of the 
same sample in Fig. 6, where a 3 MeV 4He+ beam hardly 
detects any Pb, while at I MeV the mass resolution is 
markedly decreased. As a compromise, most of the mea- 
surements have been performed at 2 MeV, although the 
elements with isotopes lying closely on the mass scale 
(5’ V-52Cr, 63Cu-64Zn, 208Pb-2wBi) could hardly be dis- 
tinguished. It is known, however, which elements are 
typical contaminants of aerosols [21] and what the abun- 
dances of neighbouring impurities are. For example, in the 
case of the pair 2osPb/2WBi the identification criterion 
was that the atmospheric appearance of Bi is three orders 
of magnitude lower than that of Pb. 
RBS spectra were evaluated with the following assump- 
tions: elements were identified according to their surface 
peak positions in the energy spectrum to which a mass 
scale was calculated. For an incident energy of E. = 2 
MeV 4He + and a detector resolution of A E = I2 keV the 
mass-resolution was calculated to change monotonically 
from Am= 1.3 at m=5l (V) to Am=5.4 at m= II2 
(Cd) and to Am = 17.4 at m = 207 (Pb) by using the 
equation m/Am = 4~ 1 p - I J(/.L + I)-‘/(AE/E,), 
(backscattering angle = 180’). where p is the mass ratio of 
target atom to analyzing ion [22]. The above values of 
mass resolution are typical for RBS with solid state detec- 
tors but have been improved by using an electrostatic 
analyser system (ESA) [l9]. By this means, a (constant) 
energy resolution of A E/E = 0.001, can be obtained with 
reasonable ESA sizes and slit widths. Thus, one would 
achieve mass resolutions of Am - I up to m - 100 and 
Am - 3 up to m _ 200. 
The corresponding peak integrals were used for the 
determination of elemental concentration. The precision of

the latter is a few % only for particles smaller than 500 nm 
in diameter. Calculations based on a model of spheres on a 
flat substrate showed that e.g. the Pb signals in the mea- 
sured spectra correspond to particle sizes of 80-300 nm in 
diameter. For larger particles a suitable correction factor or 
different spectra evaluation procedure should be intro- 
duced. [l] W.K. Chu, M-A. Nicolet and J.W. Mayer, Backscattering

The Rutherford scattering cross section rises with the 
atomic number of the target atoms according to u a 2’. 
It means that the sensitivity in atoms/cm2, e.g. for Cd, is 
increased approximately by factor of 10 and for Pb by 
factor of 100 as compared to V. The present detection limit 
of Pb in our aerosol samples is at the level of 10” atoms. 
This corresponds to an area1 density of lOI atoms/cm2. 
Thus, with the present set-up it is possible to detect Pb in 
concentrations of the order of tenths of ng/m3 of air. This 
limit can be easily lowered by enlargement of the air 
volume used for sampling, which was in most cases only 
at the level of 0.5 m3. Also using the annular ring detector 
system [20] a gain by a factor of at least 10 in solid angle 
and therewith also in detection limit can be achieved. [7] W. Reuter, Nucl. Instr. and Meth. 218 (1983) 391.

The target concentrations as derived from the evaluated 
spectra are summarized in Table 1. The uncertainty of the 
present results originating from both measurement and 
evaluation procedures was estimated as less than 10%. The 
accuracy of the air contamination depends also on some 
details of the sampling procedure. As this procedure was 
not of primary concern in this work and was not yet 
optimized these results are presented only for illustration 
of the sensitivity level. [I31 I. Borbely-Kiss, L. Haszpra, E. Koltay, S. Lbsz16, A.

5. Conclusion 
The results achieved at the present state of method 
development indicate that RBS can be successfuly applied 
to various tasks of atmospheric aerosol research. Future 
improvements, however, will have to include several fac- 
tors, such as mass resolution, detection efficiency and 
spectrum evaluation. 1201 R. Ginzler, V. Schiile, G. Seeliger. M. Weiser, K. Bijhringer,
