bridgehead silicon atoms of 2.407 .~ in 3 lies in the range of common Si-Si single bonds.

1. Introduction 
There has currently been considerable interest in the 
chemistry of Group IV propellanes (la) and 
bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (lb) in view of the nature of the 
bridgehead bonds [ 1-3]. Pentasila[ 1.1.1 ]propellane has 
not been isolated as yet, although a derivative of bicy- 
clo[ 1.1.1 ]pentasilane [4] has been synthesized. Accord- 
ing to both calculations and experiments, M-M dis- 
tances in [1.1.1]propellanes (M = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Y = 
CH 2, Sill2, GeH 2, SnH 2) are much shorter than those 
in bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes except for the tin analogue 
[2-7]. Theoretically, substitution of electronegative 
groups (e.g. O, CH 2) at the peripheral positions should 
stabilize the central M-M interaction for M = Si [5e]. 
Therefore, the structures of [1.1.1]propellanes of the 
type M2Y 3 (M = Si, Ge, Sn; Y = O, S, Se) (la) and the 
corresponding bicyclo[ 1.1.1 ]pentanes H 2 M2Y3 (lb) are 
very similar [6]. 
According to theoretical studies, trioxadisilabicyclo- 
[1.1.1 ]pentane (2) is predicted to have a short distance 
between the bridgehead silicon atoms of only 2.069 ,~ 
[5], which is shorter than that of silicon-silicon double

Pit S0022-328X(96)06121-9 bond. The corresponding distance in the sulfur ana- 
logue, trithiadisilab!cyclo[1.1.1]pentane, has been pre- 
dicted to be 2.363 A [6], which corresponds to a Si-Si 
single bond. However, neither the attractive compound 
2 nor its chalcogen analogue has been experimentally 
observed prior to our studies [8,9]. We have succeeded 
in synthesizing and determining the structure of 1,3- 
bis-substituted 2,4,5-trithia- 1,3-disilabicyclo[ 1.1.1 ]- 
pentane by taking advantage of an excellent steric pro- 
tection group, tris(trimethylsilyl)methyl (denoted as Tsi 
hereafter) by means of photodesulfurization of polythi- 
adisilabicyclo[k.Lm]alkanes [9]. Herein, we report the 
first full detail of the synthesis, structures and reactions 
of polythiadisilabicyclo[ k. I. m]alkanes. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Synthesis of polythiadisilabicyclo[k.l.m.]alkanes 
A decalin solution of trisylsilane {tris(trimethylsilyl)- 
methylsilane = TsiSiH 3} and 30 equivalents of elemen- 
tal sulfur were heated at 190-200°C for 2.5 days. 
Chromatographic separation afforded (TsiSi)2S 4 (4), 
(TsiSi)2S 5 (5), and (TsiSi)2S 6 (6) as yellow solids in 
22%, 12%, and 12% yields respectively, which are 
stable towards air and moisture (Scheme 1). There are 
three possible structures for 6 as shown in Fig. 1, which

2.2. Desulfurization of polythiadisilabicyclo[k.l.m.]al- 
lmnes 
Desulfurization reactions of polythiadisilabi- 
cyclo[ k. I. m]alkanes are summarized in Scheme 2. When 
reacted with PPh 3, 6 was quantitatively converted into 
5. The reaction of 5 with PPh 3 in benzene at 70°C for 1 
day resulted in no observable reaction. In contrast, it is 
well-known that photolysis of disulfide generates thiyl 
radicals, which are effectively quenched by a trivalent 
phosphorus compound and eliminate sulfur [10]. Further 
desulfurization of 5 was achieved by irradiation with a 
high pressure Hg lamp (hv > 300 nm) in the presence 
of 1.2 equivalents of triphenylphosphine in benzene for 
1(1 min to give 4 in 96% yield. When 4 was irradiated in the presence of 1.9 equivalents of triphenylphosphine 
for 4 h, 2,4,5-trithia- 1,3-disilabicyclo[ 1.1.1 ]pentane (3) 
was obtained in 64% yield. When 4 was subjected to 
photolysis in the presence of a ten-fold excess of PPh 3, 
cyclodisilthiane 7 and 3 could be isolated in 28% and 
27% yields respectively, while independently, 3 did not 
further react under identical conditions (Scheme 3). 
Desulfurization of 4 in d8-toluene afforded dl- or d 2- 
cyclodisilthiane and cyclodisilthiane 7 (11% yield, D: H 
= 35 : 65) along with 3 (29% yield). This suggested that 
proton sources for the formation of 7 are methyl groups 
of solvent and substituents of compound 4. 
The most likely initial step of the photochemical 
desulfurization of 4 is the S-S bond cleavage. Trapping 
of the resulting thiyl biradical by one or two molecules

of PPh 3 would then lead to the formation of 3 and 7 as 
shown in Scheme 4. 
By the irradiation in the presence of trimethylphos- 
phine, 4 was quantitatively converted into 3. Separation 
by gel-permeation liquid chromatography followed by 
recrystallization from benzene, afforded 3 as white crys- 
tals. The structure of 3 was unequivocally determined 
by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The com- 
pound 3 is thermally quite stable (about 300°C) but 
slowly hydrolyzed by moisture to provide 1,3-bis 
{tris(trimethylsilyl)methyl}- 1 -hydroxy-3-mercaptocyclo- 
disilthiane 8 (Eq. (1)), which was further hydrolyzed to 
1,3-bis{tris(trimethylsilyl)methyl} 1-3-dihydroxy- 1,3- 
dimercaptosulfide 9 (Eq. (1)). groups. Interestingly, compounds 4Se and 3Se, which 
are selenium analogues of 4 and 3 respectively, show 
the same chemical shifts of a methyl carbon in the Tsi 
group as those of 4 and 3 respectively. 29Si NMR data 
of the bridgehead silicons in 6, 5, 4, and 3 are 46.4, 
37.3, 25.7, and 5.8 ppm, which are in order of the strain 
of silthiane tings. In contrast, those of 4Se [11] and 3Se 
[8] are -7.5 and -59.0 ppm respectively. The differ- 
ence of the bridgehead silicon's chemical shift between 
3 and 3Se is derived from the stereo-compression effect 
between the peripheral atoms [12].

(6, 5, 4, and 3) 
IH, 13C, and 295i NMR spectral data of 6, 5, 4 and 3 
are shown in Table 1. 13C NMR data of methyl carbon 
in 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.5 ppm, which 
are in order of the steric repulsion of the two Tsi Although the absorption maximum of polysulfides in 
the UV-vis spectrum is shifted to longer wavelengths 
with the number of sulfur atoms [13], that of cyclic 
polysulfides is shifted to shorter wavelengths with the 
number of ring atoms [ 14]. The smaller dihedral angle 
of cyclic polysulfide is responsible for the increasing 
ring strain. Typical cyclic disulfides, tetramethylene

disulfide and trimethylene disulfide have C-S-S-C 
dihedral angles of 60 ° and 27 ° and absorption maxima 
at 286 and 330 nm respectively [14]. Interestingly, 4 has 
a Si-S-S-Si dihedral angle of 0 ° and an absorption 
maximum at 366 nm. Compound 5 also has small 
Si-S-S-Si dihedral angles, 11 ° and 19 °, and an absorp- 
tion maximum at 375 nm. The longer wavelength of 
375 nm in 5 than 4 is due to the through space 
interaction between the intramolecular two disulfides. A 
remarkable S • • • S interaction of 2-S3 was observed at 
290 nm (e 38) in the electronic spectrum. That the 
weak but definite absorption at 290 nm was assigned as 
originating from the S • • • S interaction of 3 was based 
on the following two reasons. Firstly, cyclodisilthiane 7 
does not have a definite absorption around 290 nm. This 
suggests that the absorption of 290 nm in 3 is not 
derived from a Si-S bond. Secondly the selenium ana- 
logue, (TsiSi)zSe 3, displays an absorption band at 365 
nm (6 33) [15]. Moreover, (TsiGe)2Se 3 also exhibits an 
absorption maximum in the same region (365 nm). It 
was concluded that the absorption at 365 nm was 
derived from a Se .-- Se interaction [12]. 
2.5. X-ray analysis of polythiadisilabicyclo[k.l.m]al- 
kanes (6, 5, 4, and 3)

for molecule 2 are listed in Tables 5 and 6 respectively. 
Both independent molecules of 4 are essentially identi- 
cal structurally. The Si atoms of the C(SiMe3) 3 group 
were disordered equally between two sets of sites 
(Si(3A, 4A, 5A) and Si(3C, 4C, 5C) in molecule 1 and 
Si(3B, 4B, 5B) and Si(3D, 4D, 5D) in molecule 2), 
whereas the positions of the carbon atoms are identical 
for both sets, and refinement of occupancies of 
Si(3A, 4A, 5A) and Si(3C, 4C, 5C) in molecule 1 and 
Si(3B, 4B, 5B) and Si(3D, 4D, 5D) in molecule 2 sug- 
gested that these should be in the ratio of 3:2 in each 
molecule. The five-membered ring in the bicyclo[2.1.1 ]- 
hexane skeleton is an envelope conformation, and the 
torsion angles are SilA-S3A-S4A-Si2A = 0.08 ° and 
SilB-S3B-S4B-Si2B = 0.05 °. An ORTEI' drawing of 3 
is shown in Fig. 4. Interatomic bond lengths (A), and 
angles (degree) are listed in Tables 7 and 8 respectively. 
The Si atoms of the C(SiMe3) 3 group were disordered 
equally between two sets of sites (Si(21, 22, 23) and 
Si(31, 32, 33)) whereas the positions of the carbon 
atoms are identical for both sets. The refinement of 
occupancies of Si(21, 22, 23) and Si(31, 32, 33) sug- 
gested that these should be in the ratio of 3 : 1. 
The structure of 3 is in good agreement with the 
results of the quantum chemical calculation [6], which is

reported by Gordon et al., as shown in Table 9. The 
bicyclo[1.1.1 ]pentane skeleton is constructed from three 
cyclobutanes (dihedral angles of each cyclobutane are 
120.40 °, 119.75 ° and 118.85 °, av. 120.0°). The non- 
bonding Si • • • Si distances of 5, 4, and 3 are 3.00, 2.66 
and 2.407 ,~. The Si-S-Si angles of 5, 4, and 3 are 
89.2, 75.9 (av.) and 67.08 ° (av.). Considering the com- 
mon Si-S-Si angles (ca. 82 °) [17] in cyclodisilthianes, 
these Si-S-Si values of 4 and 3 are extremely sharp. 
Especially, in 3 the acute Si-S-Si angles (66.88(3) °, 
66.98(3) ° and 67.27(4) °) can be regarded as angles of 
three-membered ring compounds rather than of normal 
four-membered ring compounds. One of the features of o 
3 is the very short S ..- S distance, 3.15 A, which is 
within the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur 
(3.70 ,~). Interestingly, the bridgehead Si-.. Si dis- 
tance of 2.407 A lies within the range of common Si-Si 
single bond lengths (2.23-2.70 ,~) [18], and is ca. 0.1 ,~ 
shorter than that of its selenium analogue (2.515 ,~) [8]. 
This value is very short relative to that of the cyclodisil- 
thianes (2.78-2.83 ,~) [17]. This unusual shortening of 
the Si-.. Si distance is caused by the difference in 
electronegativity between the peripheral sulfur atom and 
the bridgehead silicon atom. Actually, no such shorten- 
ing is observed in the corresponding silicon analogue, 
bicyclo[1.1.1]pentasilane (Si-.. Si; 2.92 ,~) [19]. The 
repulsion between sulfur atoms affects the shortening of

3. Experimental section 
3.1. General consideration 
All manipulations were performed using standard 
Schlenk techniques under an argon atmosphere. Sol- 
vents were dried over sodium benzophenone ketyl, dis- 
tilled, and degassed prior to use. The reagents used in 
this study were purchased from commercial sources and 
purified, dried and degassed as necessary. Preparative 
gel-permeation liquid chromatography (GPC) was car- 
fled out on LC-908 on JAIGEL 1H and 2H column 
(Japan Analytical Indust.ry, styrene-divinylbenzene 
copolymer, pore size 25 A) with toluene as solvent. 
NMR spectra were run on either a Bruker AC-400 or 
AC-300 spectrometer at 400 and 300 MHz respectively. 
IH and J3C NMR spectra were referenced to residual 
solvent resonances which were calibrated against te- 
tramethylsilane. 29Si NMR spectra were referenced to 
external tetramethylsilane. Infrared spectra were 
recorded on a Jasco FT/IR-5000 using KBr tablet. UV 
spectra were carried out on a Jasco Ubest-55 spectrome- 
ter. Mass spectra (El) and high-resolution mass spectra 
were obtained on a Jeol JMS SX102A mass spectrome- 
ter. Infrared spectra were recorded on a FT-IR using a 
KBr tablet. Elemental analyses were carried out on a

residue was charged on silica-gel column chromatogra- 
phy (eluent; n-hexane-CH2C12). The resulting yellow 
solid was purified by GPC (eluent; toluene) and prepar- 
ative TLC to give 4 [9], 5 [9], and 6 [9] in 22% (138 
mg), 12% (77 mg), and 12% (85 mg) yield respectively. 
3.3. Desulfurization of 6 with PPh 3 
A benzene (5 ml) solution of 6 (108 mg, 0.13 mmol) 
and triphenylphosphine (51 mg, 0.19 mmol) was stirred 
for 30 min. After removal of the solvent, the residue 
was separated by silica-gel column chromatography 
(eluent; n-hexane-CH2C12) to give 5 (105 mg, quant.). 
3.4. Desulfurization of 5 with PPh 3 under irradiation 
A d6-benzene (400/xl) solution of 5 (13 rag, 0.019 
mmol) and triphenylphosphine (6.3 mg, 0.024 mmol) in 
a NMR tube was irradiated by a high-pressure Hg lamp 
at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by Z H 
and 13C NMR. After 10 min, the solvent was removed 
in vacuo, and the residue was separated by preparative 
TLC to afford 4 (11.5 mg, 96% yield). 
3.5. Desulfurization of 4 with PPh 3 under irradiation 
A benzene (20 ml) solution of 4 (129 mg, 0.20 
mmol) and triphenylphosphine (80 mg, 0.31 mmol) in a 
Pyrex glass tube was irradiated by a high-pressure Hg 
lamp for 2 h at room temperature. After removal of the 
solvent, the residue was separated by GPC (eluent; 
toluene) to give 3 [9] (78.6 mg, 64% yield). 
3.6. Desulfurization of 4 with excess amount of PPh 3 
under irradiation 
(a) In benzene: a benzene (3.5 ml) solution of 4 (42 
mg, 0.065 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (172 mg, 0.66 

164 N. Choi et al./Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 516 (1996) 155-165 
mmol) in a Pyrex glass tube was irradiated by a high- 
pressure Hg lamp for 15 rain at room temperature. After 
removal of the solvent, the residue was separated by 
GPC (eluent; toluene) to afford 3 (10.6 mg) and 7 [9] 
(10.4 rag) in 27% and 28% yields respectively. 
(b) In toluene: a d8-toluene (400 /zl) solution of 4 
(17 mg, 0.026 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (67 mg, 
0.26 mmol) in an NMR tube was irradiated by a 
high-pressure Hg lamPlat room temperature. The reac- 
tion was monitored by H and 13C NMR. After 60 min, 
the solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was 
separated by GPC (eluent; toluene) to afford 3 and d 1_ 
and dz-7 in 29% and 11% (H:D=65:35) yields, 
respectively. 
3.7. Desulfurization of 4 with PMe s under irradiation 
A d6-benzene (400 /zl) solution of 4 (12 mg, 0.018 
mmol) and PMe 3 (1.0 M THF solution, 130 /zl, 0.13 
mmol) in a NMR tube was irradiated by a high-pressure 
Hg lamp at room temperature. The reaction was moni- 
tored by ~H and ~3C NMR. After 20 min, 4 was 
completely consumed. After removal of the solvents 
and excess of PMe 3 in vacuo, the residue was separated 
by GPC (eluent; toluene) to give 3 (11 mg, quant.). 
3.8. Hydrolysis of 3 
A benzene solution of 3 was hydrolyzed by moisture 
in air to yield 8, quantitatively. A benzene solution of 8 
[9] was further hydrolyzed by moisture in air to give 9, 
quantitatively. For 9: white crystals, m.p. 255-256°C,

3.9. Crystal and experimental data for 5, 4, and 3 [21] 
Yellow crystals of 5, pale yellow crystals of 4, and 
colorless crystals of 3 obtained from recrystallization 
from benzene, were used for X-ray analyses. Crystal 
data and data collection parameters and results of the 
analyses are listed in Table 2. Diffraction measurements 
were made on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 computer-con- 
trolled Kappa axis diffractometer by using graphite 
monochromatized Mo K a radiation. The unit cell was 
determined and refined from 25 randomly selected re- 
flections obtained by using the CAD4 automatic search, 
center, index, and least squares routines. All data pro- 
cessing was performed on a Micro VAX3100 computer 
by using the MolEN structure-solving program obtained from Enraf-Nonius Corp., Delft, Netherlands. The w-2 0 
scan technique was adopted by varying the to scan 
width as a function of 0 (to scan width; 0.4+ 
0.620 tan 0 for 5, 0.6+0.350tan 0 for 4, 0.6+ 
0.550 tan 0 for 3). All intensities were corrected for 
Lorentz and polarization factors as well as decay correc- 
tion. An empirical absorption correction based on a 
series of @scan was also applied to the data. Neutral- 
atom scattering factors were calculated by the standard 
procedures [22a]. An anomalous dispersion correction 
was applied to all non-hydrogen atoms [22b]. Full-ma- 
trix least-squares refinements minimized the function 
Zw(lFol-IFcl) 1, w= 1. 
Compound 5 crystallized in the monoclinic crystal 
system. The space group P2 l/a was identified uniquely 
on the basis of the systematic absences observed during 
the collection of the data (hOl, h = 2n, 0k0, k = 2n). 
The structure was solved by a combination of direct 
methods (MULTAN 80) and difference Fourier syntheses. 
Hydrogen atoms were not included in the calculation. 
Compound 4 crystallized in the triclinic crystal sys- 
tem. There were no systematic_absences; the space 
group was determined to be P1. The structure was 
solved by a combination of direct methods (MULTAN 80) 
and difference Fourier syntheses. Hydrogen atoms were 
not included in the calculation. 
Compound 3 crystallized in the monoclinic crystal 
system. From the systematic absences of hO1, l= 
2n, 0k0, k=2n, and from subsequent least squares 
refinement, the space group was determined to be 
P2Jc. The structure was solved by a combination of 
direct methods (MULTAN 80) and difference Fourier syn- 
theses. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotrop- 
ically, and the hydrogen atoms were refined isotropi- 
cally. Some of hydrogen atoms (33 atoms) were found 
in the D-Fourier map and the others (21 atoms) were 
located by calculation. Disordered hydrogen atoms at- 
tached to nine carbon atoms connected to Si(3 l, 32, 33) 
were not included. 
Refinement was performed by the full-matrix least 
squares method with 622 (for 5), 631 (for 4), and 307 
(for 3) variable parameters (anisotropic thermal parame- 
ters for non-hydrogen atoms, where the positions and 
thermal parameters for hydrogen atoms were not re- 
fined). The molecular structures with atomic labelling 
schemes and the bond lengths and angles are given in 
Figs. 2-4 and Tables 2-8.

[16] X-ray crystallography confirmed that the structure of 6 is 1,3- 
disilabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, but precise structural data 
could not be obtained due to their severe disorder. X-ray 
diffraction data for 6: a = 15.7002, b = 9.1128, c= 27.1299 A, 
/3 = 102.2160 °, R ~ 14.1%, R~,. = 16.4%.
