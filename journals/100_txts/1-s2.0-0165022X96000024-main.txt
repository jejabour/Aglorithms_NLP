Abstract 
A new assay to measure cell proliferation by turbidimetric evaluation of cultures in specially 
designed microtiter plates was set up. The IL-2-dependent proliferation of CTLL-2 cell line was 
used as a model. The novel microtiter plate detection system, the General Cell Screening System 
(GCSS) was used for the evaluation of the cell proliferation assay. The test system utilizes the 
population growth rate (CL) of the cells. The tests were performed in specially designed microtiter 
plates which were read in a scanning spectrophotometer. These results were compared with 
calorimetric assays, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTTI 
and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl~-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium, 
inner salt (MTS) as substrates. In contrast to conventional methods, the presently described system 
is not an end-point method, this means that cell growth can be observed over a certain period and 
is not limited to a single moment during the period of cell growth. Another advantage is the 
reduction of manual manipulations and the avoidance of toxic or radioactive substances and 
organic solvents. Therefore, a higher number of samples can be analyzed compared to other 
methods. The range for detection was 0.015-10 units IL-2 per well, and the accuracy is in the 
range of < 0.005 standard deviation.

1. Introduction 
Determination of cytokines as growth factors in a biological relevant manner is very 
complex. since the assay has to be based on growth kinetics. Conventional proliferation 
assays take only two points into considerations. the culture starting point and end point. 
Very often only the culture end point is evaluated [l-3]. This approach cannot be 
considered as kinetics assay. Modifying the conventional assays to true kinetics assays 
multiplies the number of cell culture experiments by the number of observations used 
for the kinetics studies. The described methods do not have this limitation, since the cell 
culture can be measured in a non-destructive way at different time periods. 
We have chosen an IL-2-dependent cell line (CTLL-2) as an exemplary model of 
cytokine induced proliferation. IL-2 being considered as one of the major regulatory 
molecules in the immune system [4-61. Interleukin-2 (IL-2). a I8 kDa glycopeptide. is 
produced by activated T-lymphocytes. Several biological processes are driven by IL-2 
such as proliferation and/or differentiation of T-lymphocytes. modulation of B- 
lymphocytes responses and increasing of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells and 
monocytes. 
Two conventional assays are commonly used to evaluate cell proliferation: colorimet- 
ric and radioisotopic assays. In the calorimetric assay [I 2.71 the substrate 3-(45dimeth- 
ylthiazol-2-yll-2.5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or 3-(45dimethylthiazol-2-y@ 
S-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-3-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) [8] are 
reduced by mitochondrial dehydrogenases to formazan. Using radioisotopic assays the 
measurement of the DNA-synthesis rate of growing cells after a pulse with radiolabelled 
nucleotides is performed [3]. 
In order to avoid the use of radioisotopes or of toxic tetrazolium salts, we developed 
a computer controlled system making it possible to measure the IL-2-dependent prolifer- 
ation of CTLL-2 cells without further manipulations. 
The principle of the assay is based on the evaluation of turbidity of the cell culture 
measuring the entire volume of the well in concentration steps by using General Cell 
Screening System (GCSS). This allows the quantification of the particle content of 
non-homogeneously distributed suspensions. 
The turbidity measurement is heavily dependent on cell density. on size, shape and 
growth pattern of the cells. One major requirement for cell count determination is the 
development of the special designed GCSS plates. These plates have a rectangular 
bottom, with a planconvex shape and conical walls. The rectangular bottom is essential 
in order to scan the entire well by the light path. having the same width as the well 
bottom. The geometry of the well bottom allows to cover the whole well in 17 steps. 
The addition of these measurements are integrated to the total transmission. 
For determination of IL-?. IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 [IO] cells were seeded into 
specially designed 96-well microtiterplates. The seeded cells were cultivated with 
different IL-2 concentrations by incubation under standard conditions. By repetitive 
measurements of the culture plates, the cell count can be determined. From cell counts 
of different time periods the growth rate t pu) and the cell growing curves can be 
calculated. The correlation between the kinetics data and the cell proliferation allows the 
quantification of IL-2 activity. The results of the assay were compared with the

calorimetric assays, using MTT and MTS as substrates. Essential parameters such as 
accuracy and analytical range of both test systems were compared. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Cell line and medium 
The murine cytotoxic T-cell line (CTLL-2) was obtained from European Collection 
for Animal Cell Cultures (Porton, UK). The cells were cultivated in RPM1 1640 
(Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf 
serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 pg/ml sodium pyruvate, 1 kg/ml 2-mercaptoethanol, 
1% non-essential amino acids composition (100 X concentrate; Seromed-Biochrom KG, 
Berlin, Germany) and 20 units recombinant human Interleukin-2 per ml (Boehringer- 
Mannheim-Biochemie, Vienna, Austria) 
2.2. Cell number calibration curue 
For the determination of cell number a calibration curve was carried out. For this 
purpose CTLL-2 cells were diluted 2-fold from 8 X lo5 to 3.125 X lo3 cells per well in 
volumes of 100 ~1 per well in GCSS plates. After a 2-h incubation period the 
transmission at 690 nm was measured. The plot of cell density versus the change of 
transmission was used as calibration curve for cell number. 
2.3. Determination of IL-2 activity by GCSS 
Prior to the proliferation assays, the cells were washed twice in IL-2 free medium and 
suspended at 1.4 X IO5 cells/ml in IL-2 free medium. 50 ~1 of the suspension were 
transferred into each well of the 96-well plate, the wells already contained 50 ~1 of IL-2 
in 2-fold dilutions from 10 to 0.015 U/well. In order to remove potential air bubbles 
and to minimize temperature influences, the IL-2 filled culture plates were preincubated 
for 1 h at 37°C. Recombinant human Interleukin-2, purchased from Boehringer-Man- 
nheim Biochemie (Vienna, Austria) was used as a standard. After cell seeding, plates 
were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO, atmosphere for a total 72 h of culturing Cell culture 
plates were periodically (every 12 h) read in a GCSS reader at 690 nm wavelength. The 
cell number was then calculated on the calibration curve. The population growth rate 
( p) is calculated from Eq. (I), Eq. 0, where N,,, , and N,, are cell counts at different 
times and t,+ , and t, represent the time.

2.4. Determination of IL-2 activity by calorimetric assay 
In comparison with the determination of IL-2 by the GCSS two calorimetric assays 
with MTT and MTS as substrate were performed. 
The MTT assay was carried out according to the method of Mosmann et al. [I]. 
Briefly, MTT (Sigma. St. Louis. MO, USA) was dissolved in a concentration of 4 
mg/ml and clarified by filtration through a 0.2 pm sterile discfilter (Millipore 
Corporation, Bedford, USA). Cells were seeded analogously to the prior described 
population growth rate assay. During a time period of 4 days, every 24 h 10 PI of MTT 
stock solution per well were added to one of these plates. After 4 h incubation at 37°C 
and 5%- CO, atmosphere. 70 ~1 of supernatant were removed from each well and 
discarded and 100 ~1 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO. Sigma. St. Louis. MO, USA) were 
added to the wells to dissolve the dark blue formazan crystals. After complete solubiliza- 
tion adsorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer using a test wavelength of 590 nm 
and reference wavelength of 690 nm. 
For the second calorimetric assay MTS (Promega, Madison, USA) instead of MTT 
was used. MTS in combination with PMS (phenanzine methosulfate) as electron 
coupling reagent is reduced to a medium soluble formazan. Microtiterplates containing 
100 ~1 cell suspension per well were prepared as described above. After 24.48 and 72 h 
incubation 20 ~1 MTS/PMS stock solution per well were added to the growing cells. 
Plates were again incubated for at least 6 h followed by the adsorption reading at 492 
nm with reference wavelength of 690 nm. In both assays samples were quantified using 
an internal standard curve. 
2.5. GCSS-instrurnentutior~ cd techicctl details 
A prototype of the GCSS reader and a prototype of the specially designed cell culture 
plates were used for the setting up of the method. Meanwhiles the equipment consisting 
of GCSS reader, GCSS plates and GCSS software [9]. is commercially available (SLT 
Labinstuments GmbH. UntersbergstraBe I, A-5082 Gr8ding). The conventional 96-well 
cell culture plates have a very limited application for the determination of cell counts. A 
non-stirred culture is a non-homogeneous suspension. The well form, the non-homoge- 
neous suspension and the single measurement of each well do not allow a correct 
determination of cell number and the observation of the cell kinetics during cell growth. 
To circumvent these problems the turbidity of the whole well must be taken into 
account. By scanning a well with a rectangular cross-section the whole well can be 
measured. The planconvex shape of the bottom in combination with a defined light- 
beamwidth is necessary to measure the whole volume of the well, to avoid quenching 
Fig. 1. Schematic drawng of one GCSS well. Each well has 3 rectangular crosssection, a planconvex shape 
with conical side wall\. The width of the hottom corresponds to the light path width.

and other effects by reflection, when the lightpath is transmitting the well bottom. The 
conical sidewalls provide the same well volume as conventional wells. Furthermore, 
convenient pipetting of liquids in well with conical sidewalls are made more practical. 
The GCSS reader scans each well in 17 additive steps. Only the specially designed 
planconvex cell culture wells in combination with the rectangular lightbeam make the 
measurement of the rectangular bottoms possible. A schematic drawing of the cell 
culture well (GCSS well) is shown in Fig. 1. Data were directly transferred to an Apple 
Macintosh computer and calculations were carried out by GCSS software. The GCSS 
reader was placed in a laminar flow hood to avoid airbom contamination during the 
measuring procedure. 
3. Results 
IL-2-dependent proliferation of CTLL-2 cells evaluated by GCSS over a period of 5 
days is reported in Fig. 2. The GCSS software offers the possibility to zoom each well to 
get more detailed information and in Fig. 2 one selected graph shows the history of a 
single well. Each data point of this growth curve represents the cell count of the CTLL-2 
cells at a certain time. By this zoomed representation the exponential growth phase can 
be easily evaluated.

growth curve is shown and the population growth rate (~1 is calculated within the 
exponential growth phase. Dependence of IL-2 proliferation on the IL-2 concentration is 
shown. For accuracy reasons the samples covering border wells are measured in 
triplicates because border wells often shows outliners. 
The calibration curve of CTLL-2 cells (opacity vs. cell number) is shown in Fig. 4 
and demonstrate that the GCSS offers the cell number determination by measuring the 
turbidity of a non-homogeneous cell suspension, essential for the calculation of IL-2 
activity. 
The exact determination of cell density can be used for the quantitative determination 
activity of IL-2. Therefore IL-2 samples and IL-2 standard were tested in different 
concentration ranges. In Fig. 5A population growth rate/h data of IL-2 standard 
performed in 8 parallel GCSS plates are shown. One selected sample is tested in the 
same plates. Data are shown in Fig. 5B. The confidence limits of the fitted parameters 
(a,--~,) of the fourth polynom do not differ significantly ((Y = 0.05). 
If the slope of p versus concentration differs between sample and standard curve, the 
determination of the sample activity is not accurate (Fig. 6). A reduced slope can be an 
indication for inhibitation, a competitive effect or a reduced biological activity (activity 
based on mass or molarity of the target protein).

The GCSS method can also be used for checking the identical activity of different 
samples compared with a known standard. In order to ascertain if different samples have 
the same IL-2 activity one can determine the IL-2 content by ELBA, prior to the 
proliferation assay. The samples in the bioactivity test were diluted to the identical IL-2 
content as derived by ELISA. The curve of p versus concentration must be identical in 
the case of same IL-2 activity as shown in Fig. 7. 
To find the appropriate time interval for quantification, we calculated the population 
growth rate after 48-h and 72-h incubations and the calculated IL-2 levels were 
compared (Table 1). No significant difference in IL-2 activity could be observed using 
different time periods for calculation of CL. This data show that the assay is not

The novel proliferation assay. using the General cell screening system, was compared 
to conventional methods. Calorimetric MTT and MTS assays were performed as written 
in Section 2: Materials and methods. Results of 7 different samples with unknown IL-2

IL-2 activity were plotted against the concentration of IL-2. The residuals were 
calculated by substraction of the GCSS-data from the conventional calorimetric assay 
data used in this study. No trend could be observed over the whole range of IL-2 (Fig. 
81, where MTT and MTS data are applicable. The residuals did not depend on the IL-2 
concentrations. 
4. Discussion 
The GCSS offers a novel strategy for measurement of the biological activity of 
cytokine samples in terms of cell proliferation. By measuring the transmission during the 
incubation period of an IL-2-dependent cell line (CTLL-2), we found that we could 
exactly determine the cell number of a given cell type. The increase in cell density is the 
fundamental criterion for the proliferation assay. In contrast to other cell proliferation 
assays, the range for detection of this particular assay is very broad. Assays based on the 
incorporation of radiolabelled nucleotides [3,11] detect cell proliferation after addition of 
the nucleotides. The DNA synthesis rate which is observed in a narrow time range can 
be correlated to the biological activity. The incorporation and in consequence the 
analytical response depends heavily on the cell activity at the time period, between the 
addition of nucleotides to the cell population and the harvesting of the cells. These 
parameters must be carefully optimized in order to obtain reliable data. In the case of 
GCSS a lag phase can be detected and for instance an early termination of the assay can 
be avoided. In all types of end-point assays only one observation, that at the time of cell 
harvesting or addition of MTT or MTS, is used for quantification. 
The calculation of the population growth rate ( ~1 of CTLL-2 cell line over a 48-h 
cultivation can be correlated to the IL-2 activity of IL-2 containing samples of different 
origin, autologous or recombinant. The regression coefficients of the fourth polynom 
were R = 0.998, R,, = 0.996 and Adj Rsqr = 0.993 in the concentration range between 
9.76 X 10e3 units IL-2 and 10 units IL-2. Advantages of the system, which is based on 
growth kinetics is obvious. Each plate can be measured 32 times without further 
manipulation and without influencing the culture conditions. This feature makes the 
system more transparent and cell densities can be observed over a long time period. The 
optimal time where an exponential growth curve is observed can be utilized for 
calculation. More samples can be processed in a continuously controlled system. 
Therefore manpower, time and costs are minimized. 
In comparison with calorimetric (MTT, MTS) methods or incorporation of radiola- 
belled nucleotides (L3H]Tdr) no use of toxic components or solvents and radioactive 
substances is necessary. All these methods therefore require additional manipulation 
steps and represent only one moment of a continuous situation. The main advantage of 
the GCSS proliferation assay is the fact that one culture can be kept under permanent 
observation and the calculation of the cell kinetics is simplified by the direct combina- 
tion of the multiwell scanning spectrophotometer with the personal computer. 
The results of the GCSS-IL-2 proliferation assay correlate with the results calculated 
in calorimetric assays (Table 2). The residuals of GCSS-MIT and GCSS-MTS versus 
IL-2 activity are randomly distributed. The reproducibility of our test system relies on 
the quality of the specially designed multiwell plates. the minimization of the manipula- 
tions (no indirect measurement of cell density by addition of a component) and the use 
of the optimal cell density. Consequently. precise quantitation of samples are shown in 
Fig. 5B. 
Our observations with the GCSS-IL-2 method suggest that determination of IL-2 
activity in a computer assisted system, without further manipulations, simplifies the 
handling of multiple samples in a routine laboratory. We feel that this system is safer 
and more cost effective compared to other methods. In principle the test is also suited 
for screening of cytokine-dependent cells other than CTLL-2 cell line. The system is 
also applicable for the screening of growth or inhibition factors. When a biological 
activity is observed in conjunction with cell kinetics GCSS can be used for quantifica- 
tion of this biological activity.
