Impinging flames are used in industrial heating and melting, safety research, and aerospace 
applications. Multiple modes of heat transfer are commonly important in those processes. 
However, the detailed heat transfer mechanisms are not well understood. The available 
semianalytical heat transfer solutions have only limited applicability. Therefore, re- 
searchers and designers have either made measurements or used empirical correlations to 
determine the heat flux rates. Here, the empirical correlations are reviewed. The correla- 
tions are first arranged by the flow geometry. Four geometries have been studied. These 
include flames impinging: (1) normal to cylinders in cross-flow; (2) normal to hemispheri- 
cally nosed cylinders; (3) normal to plane surfaces; and (4) along plane surfaces. The 
correlations are then arranged by the size of the region on the target under consideration. 
Correlations that apply to a small region on the target, such as the stagnation point, are 
referred to as the local heat flux. Correlations that apply to a large region of the target, 
such as the entire body of a cylindrical target, are referred to as the average heat flux. Next, 
the correlations are arranged by the type of heat transfer. Correlations for natural and 
forced convection, thermochemical heat release (TCHR), radiation, forced convection with 
TCHR, and forced convection with radiation have been reported for some combinations of 
geometry and operating conditions. Finally, the correlations are arranged by the flow type, 
either laminar or turbulent. Correlations do not exist for many combinations of geometry 
and operating conditions; therefore, recommendations are given for further research.

Introduction 
Flame impingement heating is important in many processes. 
Low-intensity flames are used to heat metal bars prior to rolling 
into sheets. They are also used in safety research. In one applica- 
tion, they are used to quantify the heating rate caused by 
buoyant fires impinging on walls and ceilings. In others, they are 
used to simulate extensive fires, impinging on structural ele- 
ments. Such high-velocity flames may be caused by ruptured fuel 
pipes. High-intensity flame impingement arises in many applica- 
tions. They are commonly used to melt scrap metal and to shape 
glass. They have also been used in recent years to produce 
synthetic diamond coatings by chemical vapor deposition. They 
have been used in thermal spallation, where a supersonic velocity 
flame bores holes through rock. The rock fragmentation is caused 
by large, transient, thermal stresses. This is attributable to high 
heat fluxes impinging on cold surfaces. High-intensity flame

fluxes encountered by space vehicles, re-entering the Earth's 
atmosphere. High fluxes are caused by the hypersonic impact gas 
velocities, which ionize the highly shocked atmospheric gases. 
The primary objective of this review is to provide designers 
and researchers with available empirical heat transfer correla- 
tions for flame impingement on target surfaces. Another objec- 
tive is to provide a comprehensive reference for this subject and 
to identify areas requiring further research. 
Heat transfer mechanisms 
Convection, thermochemical heat release, radiation, and conden- 
sation are the heat transfer mechanisms identified in the flame 
impingement studies reviewed here. The relative importance of 
each heat transfer mechanisms depends on the experimental 
conditions. For example, when targets have been located inside a 
hot furnace, radiation from the environment; that is, the furnace 
walls, has been very important. However, for targets not located 
in any enclosure, radiation from the ambient environment is 
negligible. In many circumstances, multiple mechanisms have 
been combined into one heat transfer correlation. This has 
commonly been done for forced convection coupled with thermo-

chemical heat release (TCHR), primarily because of the difficulty 
in experimentally separating these mechanisms. In some studies, 
heat transfer mechanisms have been completely ignored, without 
sufficient justification. These are discussed by Baukal et al. 
(1996). The following section is a general discussion of these 
mechanisms. A detailed presentation of specific correlations, the 
main subject of this work, follows in a later section. 
Convection 
Forced convection. This is the predominant mechanism in 
low-intensity flames, with negligible chemical dissociation. Lami- 
nar flames were investigated in several studies (e.g., Jackson and 
Kilham 1956). Turbulent flames were tested in many studies (e.g., 
Giedt et al. 1960). There, the turbulence level directly enhances 
the importance of forced convection. 
Natural convection. You (1985) correlated the heat transfer 
for a buoyant flame in terms of the Rayleigh number. The 
correlations are given later in Equation 27. Buoyancy was impor- 
tant in their study because of the low burner exit velocities. 
Thermochemical heat release (TCHR) 
This mechanism refers to the energy release caused by exother- 
mic chemical reactions. Hot, dissociated combustion products 
impinge on a cool surface. The radical species diffuse along 
concentration gradients toward lower temperature regions. Then, 
they exothermically recombine with other species to form more 
stable molecules. The new molecular components are thermody- 
namically preferred at the lower temperatures. For example, 
there may be significant amounts of unburned fuel, in the form 
of CO and H2, produced by O2/CH 4 flames. These flames usually have much higher temperatures than air/CH 4 flames. 
This is caused by the removal of the N 2, which acts as a diluent 
to moderate the flame temperatures. The unburned fuel compo- 
nents are thermodynamically preferred at the high temperatures. 
However, at temperatures below about 1600K, these radical 
species cool and react to form CO 2 and H20. They simultane- 
ously release energy. Thermochemical heat release is commonly 
very important in high-temperature flames, because the level of 
dissociation increases with temperature. Three types of TCHR 
have been identified: equilibrium, catalytic, and mixed. These are 
discussed in Baukal et al. (1996). 
Radiation heat transfer 
Three types of thermal radiation are involved in the flame 
impingement studies reviewed here. They include nonluminous, 
luminous, and emission from surfaces. 
Nonluminous radiation. Gaseous combustion products, such 
as carbon dioxide and water vapor, produce nonluminous radia- 
tion. Radiation from CO 2 and H20 has been extensively stud- 
ied because of its important in combustion. Such radiation 
depends on the gas temperature, partial pressure, and concentra- 
tion of each gas species and the optical path length through the 
gas. In some studies, nonluminous radiation amounted to a 
significant fraction of the total heat flux to the target. Kilham's 
(1949) data indicated that flame radiation accounted for between 
5 and 16% of the total heat flux. Jackson and Kilham (1956) 
found that the measured flame radiation accounted for up to 5% 
of the total heat flux. Ivernel and Vernotte (1979) calculated 
nonluminous flame radiation effects. They accounted for up to 
34% of the total heat flux. The measured CO 2 and H20

Flame impingement heat transfer correlations: C. E. Baukal and B. Gebhart 
(Hottel and Sarofim 1967), were used to determine the flame 
emissivity. 
In some studies, nonluminous radiation was negligible. Giedt 
et al. (1960) measured and calculated the nonluminous radiation 
to be less than 2% of the total heat flux. Woodruff and Giedt 
(1966) measured the nonluminous radiation using the same con- 
figuration as Giedt et al. The effect was negligible. Shorin and 
Pechurkin (1968) also experimentally determined that radiation 
was negligible. Hoogendoorn et al. (1978) found that radiation 
did not exceed 5% of the total heat flux. No measurements or 
calculations were given. Davies (1979) calculated that nonlumi- 
nous radiation account for only 2% of the total heat flux. 
Luminous radiation. This occurs when soot particles are pro- 
duced. These radiate approximately as a blackbody. This mecha- 
nism is very important for such liquid and solid fuels as oil and 
coal. It is not commonly significant for gaseous fuels such as 
methane. You (1985) measured radiation from pure diffusion 
(qb = ~) natural gas flames. Much of this radiation is expected to 
have been luminous because of the nature of buoyant, pure 
diffusion flames. Radiation accounted for 13-26% of the total 
flux at the stagnation point. Hustad and co-workers (1991) calcu- 
lated the radiation flux to the stagnation point of a cylinder in 
cross-flow to be from 7-14% and 20-40% of the total flux for 
CH 4 and C3H 8 pure diffusion flames, respectively. Luminous 
radiation may have been important in other studies, where the 
flames were very fuel rich (e.g., Buhr et al. 1973). However, no 
measurements or calculations were reported. 
Surface radiant emission. Be6r and Chigier (1968) studied 
stoichiometric air/coke oven gas flames impinging on the hearth 
of a furnace. The measured radiation was at least 10% of the 
total heat flux. This radiation was actually the combination of the 
furnace wall radiant emission and the radiation from the flame. 
However, the radiation from that type of flame is usually negligi- 
ble, as previously discussed. 
Vizioz and Lowes (1971) and Smith and Lowes (1974) studied 
flame impingement onto a cooled plane target located inside a 
hot furnace. Radiation and convection were often determined to 
be of comparable magnitude. Vizioz and Lowes measured radia- 
tion as being 4-100% of the total heat flux. Smith and Lowes 
calculated total radiation, using Hottel's zone method (Hottel 
and Sarofim 1967). It accounted for 30-43% and 10-17% of the 
total heat transfer to water-cooled and air-cooled flat plates, 
respectively. 
Matsuo et al. (1978) studies flame impingement on a metal 
part, inside a hot furnace. Coke oven gas was combusted with air 
that had been preheated to 200°C. The top of the part was 
exposed to the impinging flame. The rest was exposed to the 
radiation from the furnace walls. Furnace radiation was the 
dominant heat transfer mechanism: (1) when the distance be- 
tween the burner and the slab was large; (2) at high slab surface 
temperatures; and (3) at large R. Ivernel and Vernotte (1979) 
calculated that radiation from the furnace walls accounted for up 
to 42% of the total heat flux. 
You (1985) studied a buoyant unenclosed flame impinging on 
a flat plate. The convective and total heat flux rates were 
measured using gauges plated with gold and black foils, respec- 
tively. By subtracting the convection effect from the total heat 
flux, radiation was calculated to be as much as 35% of the 
convective flux. Thermal radiation dropped off rapidly as R 
increased, for a fixed L. 
Water vapor condensation 
For the studies reviewed here, that of Hargrave eta]. (1987) was 
the only one that considered the effect of condensation. They 
attempted to eliminate it by careful experimental design. Flowing ethylene glycol was used to cool the inside wall of a cylinder and 
a heminosed cylinder target. Glycol has a higher boiling point 
than that of water. Therefore, the target surface temperature 
could be maintained at a high enough level to prevent water 
vapor in the combustion products from condensing on the target. 
Water-cooled targets have been used in many studies (e.g., 
Anderson and Stresino 1963). The surface temperature was 
maintained below the boiling point of the water. This prevented 
cooling water boiling inside the target. However, the water vapor 
in the combustion products may have condensed on the cool 
target surface. For air/fuel flames, the water content in the 
combustion products is relatively small. However, in O2/CH 4 
flames, for example, these products are two-thirds water. Con- 
densation may have been important in those studies. This effect 
has not been quantified in any study. 
Thermophysical properties 
The transport and thermodynamic properties used in the correla- 
tions to be presented below are discussed in this section. These 
properties have been evaluated, using several rules. These prop- 
erties include, for example, the specific heat, thermal conductiv- 
ity, enthalpy, and the viscosity of the combustion products. The 
nomenclature is shown in Figure 1. One common rule has been 
to evaluate the properties, using the gas temperature at the edge 
of the stagnation zone and the boundary layer, te: 
Pe =p(t~) (la) 
where p is the property being evaluated. Another common rule 
has been to evaluate the properties at the wall temperature of 
the target t w 
Pw =P(tw) (lb) 
Some properties have been evaluated at the film temperature. 
This is the mean temperature between the edge of the stagnation 
zone and the wall temperature. The property is evaluated using 
t5 =p[(t e + tw)/2] (lc) 
Some studies (e.g., Hargrave et al. 1987) have used a weighted 
average, over the temperature range between the edge of the 
stagnation zone and the wall temperatures, as 
~= ft~pdt/(te-tw) tw / (ld)

Flame impingement heat transfer correlations: C. E. Baukal and B. Gebhart 
Hoogendoorn et al. (1978) and Popiel et al. (1980) used the 
reference temperature method recommended by Eckert (1956): 
Pref =p[te + 0"5(tw - re) + 0"22(trec -- te)] (le) 
where 
,2 0.5 tre c = t e + t: e Pr e /2cpe (lf) 
For low-speed flows, the recovery temperature is about the same 
as t e. Therefore, Pref is nearly the same as ~ in Equation lc. 
Be6r and Chigier (1968) evaluated the properties at the maxi- 
mum temperature measured at a given location in the flame jet: 
Pmax =p(tmax ) (lg) 
Definitions of dimensionless quantities to be introduced be- 
low, such as Re, Nu, and Pr, will require specification of a 
characteristic length scale and characteristic transport properties. 
The transport properties will, in turn, require specification of the 
rule by which they are evaluated; e.g., use of a specific character- 
istic temperature of the material. When only transport proper- 
ties; i.e., material temperature, are required, this is indicated by a 
single subscript; e.g., Pr e (i.e., Pr evaluated at te). When both 
characteristic length and property temperature are required, 
these are indicated by the first and second of two subscripts, 
respectively. For example, Re,,~ is shorthand notation for 
Re,, e = PeUedn/la, e . For this example, the characteristic dimen- 
sion is dn. That dimension is an important parameter in correlat- 
ing the heat transfer. There are many possible lengths that may 
be used. The most common one has been the burner nozzle 
diameter d,. Another has been the axial distance from the 
nozzle edge to the surface stagnation point lj. For cylindrical and 
heminosed cylindrical targets (see Figures 2 and 3), the diameter 
of the body d b, has been used. For plane targets, the distance 
along the surface r has also been used. Smith and Lowes (1974) 
used the width of the cooling channel in the target l c. Kataoka et 
al. (1984) used the radius where the velocity was half the axial 
(r = 0) velocity rl/2,,. 
Empirical heat transfer correlations 
These have been generally given in two forms. The first is the 
Nusselt number, which is a dimensionless heat transfer coeffi- 
cient. In the studies considered here, it has appeared as Nu = 
aPrbRe c, where a, b, and c are constants. The second form has 
been directly in terms of the heat flux, q". These two forms are 
related as follows: q" = (k/d){Nu}At, where k is the thermal 
conductivity of the fluid, and d is a characteristic dimension. 
For consistency, most of the correlations given here are 
written in terms of q". This makes it easier to directly compare 
equations. Also, the driving force, or the potential for heat 
transfer, is explicitly given in the second form. In some correla- Figure 2 ) BURNER 
Flame impinging normal to a cylinder in cross-flow 
tions, this potential is the temperature difference. In others, it is 
the enthalpy difference. In the first form, the Nu formulation, 
the potential is not given explicitly. For the correlations con- 
verted from the first form to the second form (i.e., Nu to q"), the 
Nu relationship is shown inside curved brackets { }. 
This section is arranged to aid the designer or researcher to 
find the appropriate correlation for a specific set of conditions. 
The primary consideration is to ensure that the heat transfer 
correlation applies to the chosen geometric configuration. The 
next consideration is the location on the target where the desired 
flux is to be calculated. This has typically been at a specific 
location, such as the stagnation point. This is referred to as a 
local heat flux. Correlations have also been determined for the 
average heat flux over a given portion of the target. Next, the 
correlations are arranged in terms of the heat transfer mecha- 
nism(s). These include convection, TCHR, radiation, and combi- 
nations of these. Finally, the correlations are arranged by the 
flow type (laminar or turbulent). In some studies (e.g., Fair- 
weather et al. 1984), correlations were given for both laminar and 
turbulent flows. However, in other studies, the flow type was not 
specified. 
Flames impinging normal to a cylinder 
This refers to flames impinging perpendicular to a cylinder, as in 
Figure 2, a cylinder in cross-flow. The experimental conditions 
for previous studies, using this geometry, are given in Table 1. 
The table also shows which heat transfer mechanisms were 
correlated in those studies. 
Local convection heat transfer 
Laminar and turbulent flows. Hustad and co-workers (1991) 
measured the radiation and the total heat fluxes for both laminar 
and turbulent flows. The radiation flux was also calculated. The 
convection heat transfer was calculated by subtracting the calcu- 
lated radiation from the measured heat flux. Several correlations 
from the literature were tested for the convective portion of the 
heat transfer. The best match with the experimental convection 
at the stagnation point was the correlation from Zukauskas and

For a pure fuel jet, there may have been significant quantities of 
uncombusted species in the flame at the impingement point. 
Therefore, TCHR may have been important, but was not dis- 
cussed by Hustad and co-workers. If TCHR was present, it would 
have been included, with forced convection, in Equation 2. 
Turbulent flows. Hargrave et al. (1987) studied the effects of 
turbulence. The following correlation was determined:

This correlation underpredicted the data by up to 14%. 
Average convection heat transfer 
Laminar flows. In related studies, Kilham (1949) and Jackson 
and Kilham (1956) measured the total and radiative heat fluxes. 
The convective heat transfer was calculated by subtracting the 
radiation from the total flux. Kilham studied air/CO flames. The 
convection was correlated by: 
7~ 3 q~ ..... = ~bb {l~°r (0.35 + 0.47~eb'52)}(te -- t w) (4a) 
Jackson and Kilham studied air/H 2, O2/H 2, and Oa/CO flames. The convection was correlated by

ab (4b) 
Both equations were valid for 60 < Re b < 230. The constant 
multiplying Re b varied slightly in the two studies. McAdams's 
(1954) correlation for this geometry, but for nonreacting jet 
impingement, had a multiplier of 0.56. In the Oa/H z and O2/CO 
flames used in Jackson and Kilham's study, there may have been 
significant quantities of dissociated species. Therefore, TCHR 
may have been important, but was not discussed. If TCHR was 
present, it would have been included in Equation 4b. However, a 
larger difference in Equations 4a, b would have been expected if 
TCHR was significant. 
Laminar and turbulent flows. Hustad and co-workers (1991) 
measured the total heat flux. The radiation heat flux was as- 
sumed to be uniformly distributed around the cylinder. The 
forced convection was calculated by subtracting the calculated 
radiation from the measured total heat flux. At a turbulent 
intensity of 2%, the best fit of the data was given by

This pertains to cylinders whose axis is parallel to the flame, as 
shown in Figure 3. One end of the cylinder has a hemispherical 
nose. The flame impinges on that nose. Experimental conditions 
for these studies are given in Table 2.

related experimental data for laminar and turbulent flames. The 
correlations were modifications of empirical equations. These 
were derived for heat transfer from the stagnation point of 
heated spheres to turbulent air flows. Galloway and Sage (1968) 
recommended the following equations for nonreacting flows: 
Average radiation heat transfer 
Laminar and turbulent flows. Hustad and co-workers (1991) 
studies pure diffusion flames. The radiation from the CH 4 flames 
was given as 
q/~,rad = 5 + 3.9(1/ --Xiiftof f) (kW/m z) (9a) 
The radiation for the C3H 8 flames was given as 
q~,rad = 10 + 7.8(lj--Xlirtof f) (kW/m z) (9b) 
These were based on an analytical model of the flame as a 
radiating cylinder. The liftoff distance, Xliftoff, is the length be- 
tween the nozzle and the start of the flame. The length lj -xliftof f 
was termed the radiation height. For a conventional burner, 
Xliftof f is zero, because the flame is attached to the nozzle exit. 
The distances, used in Equations (9a, b), were in meters. In those 
studies, the fuel gas velocities at the nozzle outlet were Ma >_ 0.3. 
This equates to a minimum outlet velocity of 134 and 82 m/s for 
CH 4 and C3H8, respectively. The burning velocity in air for CH 4 
and C3H 8 is 0.37 and 0.41 m/s, respectively (lewis and von Elbe 
1987). Therefore, the flames were not attached to the burner, 
because the exit velocities were higher than the flame speed. 
This produced a so-called unattached or lifted flame. The flame 
starts where the local gas velocity is the same as the flame speed.

mental data by

based on a thermal input of qf= 60-1600 kW. The location of 
the maximum heat flux was at the center of the flame. For pure 
fuel jets, there may have been significant quantities of unburned 
fuel at the target impingement point. Therefore, TCHR may

based on a comparison of the reported velocities with those of 
other studies (see Baukal and Gebhart 1995). Radiation to the 
target was calculated. It was specifically excluded from the above 
correlation.

Laminar flows. In related studies, Hoogendoorn et al. (1978) 
and Popiel et al. (1980) determined two empirical correlations, for the heat transfer to the stagnation point. These were based 
on the axial distance between the target and the burner. The

Both correlations closely matched the data. For 5 < L < 12, the

modified form of a semi-analytic solution was also determined. It 
was a form of the equation recommended by Sibulkin (1952). 
Sibulkin's equation, along with many variations of it, is discussed 
by Baukal and Gebhart (1996). The modified correlation was:

Flame impingement heat transfer correlations. C. E. Baukal and B. Gebhart 
For L = 2 and 3, the maximum flux occurred at about R = 0.5 
and 0.2, respectively. Kataoka et al. (1984) studied an 
air/O2/CH 4 (1~ = 0.39) flame. The heat transfer to the stagna- 
tion point was correlated by: 
ke tt 
qs,conv = -- 2rl/2v {1.44Re2°~/ ..... prO5( L -X~)°"2}(te - G) (18a) 
rl/2v is the radius from burner axis, near the stagnation point, 
where the velocity is 1/2 of the velocity along the axis of 
symmetry. This correlation is valid only for L >X,. with X,, 
correlated by: 
X,, = 2.82(p,/p )°'29Ren°'°xT_0 (18b) 
In a subsequent study, Kataoka (1985) found the maximum heat 
flux for the same flame occurred at L = X,,. 
Turbulent flows. Shorin and Pechurkin (1968) empirically de-

q~' ..... = --dT { a.O4R% ]~Pre}( t e - tw ) (19a) 
This was valid for L < X~.. The correlation matched the experi-

heat flux for L > X,.

investigated industrial-scale, air and oxygen-enriched air (I~ = 
0.30) natural gas flames impinging on cooled flat plate targets, 
located inside a furnace. Three different types of flames, with 
various levels of swirl, were tested. The data were correlated by: 
q/,conv = ( ke/r ){Nur,e}(te - tw) (20a) 
In one set of tests, the surface temperature of a water-cooled 
steel flat plate was maintained below 373K. The convective heat 
flux, as a function of radius from the stagnation point, was: This was valid for 17680 < Re, _< 22700, 13 _< L _< 65. The experi- 
mental data were correlated within 9%. The peak flux was 
measured near the reaction zone. The heat flux showed a small 
linear decline with probe surface temperature, over the range 
320-1000K. Smith and Lewes (1974) determined the following 
empirical correlation: 
n 0.54 0.52 q ...... = (ke/lc){1.6Retc,~ PG }(t~ - t~) (22) 
where l~ was the width of the cooling channels. The correlation 
was valid for 0 < L _< 8.4. The fluid properties were taken as for 
air, at the gas temperatures measured near the plate. The axial 
velocity at 10 cm from the plate was used to calculate the velocity 
in Re,. Matsuo et al. (1978) determined the following correla- 
tion, for the heat flux to the stagnation point: 
q]' ..... = O.O10353(q~.936/L1.032)(t,. _ t,. ) (23a) 
Another correlation was given for the heat flux, as a function of 
the distance r from the stagnation point:

K 2 = 8.42-10-7r 3 - 1.803.103r 2 + 1.37r + 5.00 (23c) 
(23d) 
Equations 23a, b were valid for 5 _<L _< 9 and 148 _< qf< 482. 
Equation 23b was valid for 0 < r _< 500, where r was in ram.

heat flux decreased exponentially as R increased:

where qsr, conv+TCHR was measured, and dj was the estimated

In another set of tests, the surface temperature of an air-cooled 
refractory plate was maintained between 1280 and 1420K. The 
convection correlation was: 
0.035Rer°( 8 < Nut. e < 0.125Rer, e (20c) 
The Prandt number effect was included in the coefficients. In 
related studies, Buhr et al. (1973) and Kremer et al. (1974) 
determined the following modification of Sibulkin's equation: 
q~ ..... = O'0371Pr~°'6peve(hS - hS ) (21) Turbulent flows. Rauenzahn (1986) calculated the heat flux 
at the surface, from the transient temperature field in a copper 
block. The assumed form of the surface flux distribution, after 
Anderson and Stresino (1963), was:

ranged from 7.3 to 9.8 cm. The spreading radius generally de- 
creased as L decreased and as qf increased. Unfortunately, no

correlations were given for q"s ..... +THR and r 0 in terms of L 
and qf. Therefore, the constants used in the above equation are 
expected to be dependent on the specific experimental condi- 
tions. 
Average convection heat transfer 
Laminar flows. You (1985) studied pure fuel jet flames im- 
pinging on a plate. The fuel flow from the burner nozzle was 
laminar. However, the buoyant plume impinging on the plate 
was turbulent. It was found that the convective heat flux in the 
stagnation zone was essentially constant: 
q~ ..... = 31.2(qf/lZ)Rael/6pre 3.5 (27a) 
for R < 0.16. The flux decreased with R in the wall jet region: 
q~ ..... = 1.46R- 1.63(qf/l 2)Rae 1/6 pr e 3/5 (27b) 
for R > 0.16. In both cases, 10 9 < Ra < 1014 and Pr ~ 0.7. The 
Rayleigh number was defined as 
Ra- " 2 3 - gf~eqflj/peCpeVe (27C) 
NO correlations were given for the measured radiation heat flux. 
This accounted for up to 26% of the total heat flux. The radiant 
flux was specifically excluded from the above correlations. 
Turbulent flows. Shorin and Pechurkin (1968) determined the 
average heat transfer as a function of R:

This configuration is useful for studying the heat transfer to 
high-speed airfoils, where very high temperatures occur at the 
leading edge. It is also useful for studying the heat transfer from 
flames to the walls of a furnace. The experimental conditions for 
these studies are given in Table 4.

QH is the H atom heat of recombination, and mu is the H atom 
mole fraction. This correlated the data within 15%. 
Local convection and radiation heat transfer 
Turbulent flows. Be6r and Chigier (1968) studied flames im- 
pinging at a 20 ° angle from the furnace hearth (see Figure 4b). 
The correlation for the total heat flux was given as 
. 0.8 
q ...... +tad = (kmax/r){ O'13Re ..... }(/max -- tw) (31) 
The velocity in the Reynolds number was the maximum velocity 
measured at the axial distance from the point of impingement. 
The temperature tma x was the maximum temperature measured 
at the axial distance from the point of impingement. A Prandtl 
number of 0.7 was assumed. 
Recommendations 
In some of the studies considered here, multiple heat transfer 
mechanisms have been important. For example, radiation and 
forced-convection heat transfer were both important in the study 
by Be~r and Chigier (1968). Very little work has been done to try 
to separate these mechanisms and to determine their relative 
importance. This should be investigated, because it may help in 
optimizing heating processes. For instance, if radiation is impor- 
tant for a given set of conditions, it may be beneficial to optimize 
the surface radiation properties of the target. Some heat transfer 
mechanisms, such as natural convection and condensation, have 
received little or no attention. Again, these may be important 
under certain operating conditions. For example, condensation 
may be a dominant mechanism when the target surface tempera- 
ture is below the condensation point of water vapor. 
There are many combinations of geometry and operating 
conditions for which no empirical heat transfer correlations exist. 
The intent here is not to give a detailed list of all the possible 
experiments that could be done. Rather, general types of experi- 
ments are suggested. 
Flames impinging normal to a cylinder. For these flames, 
only turbulent forced convection at the stagnation point has been 
studied. No correlations have been determined for the local 
convection heat transfer with TCHR. Only one correlation, 
Equation 8, has been given for the average convection heat 
transfer with TCHR. Unfortunately, the flow type was not speci- 
fied. The radiation correlations, Equations 9a, b and 10, deter- 
mined by Hustad and co-workers (1991) and Hustad et al. (1992), 
are specific to the given operating conditions. These included 
very-high-speed flows. The equations were not nondimensional- 
ized. They should not be used outside the known experimental 
conditions. 
Flames impinging normal to a hemi-nosed cylinder. Only 
the heat transfer at the stagnation point has been studied. The 
heat flux at other locations has not been reported. No averaged 
heat flux correlations have been given. No radiation or laminar 
forced-convection correlations of any type have been reported. 
However, many semianalytic heat transfer equations have been 
used for this geometry (Baukal and Gebhart 1996). 
Flames impinging normal to a plane surface. This has 
been the most widely studied geometry. No correlations have 
been reported for local turbulent convection heat transfer with 
TCHR. The only correlations for average heat transfer have 
been for forced convection. No correlations of any kind have 
been specifically determined for radiation. Flames parallel to a plane surface. This has been the least 
studied geometry. No pure forced-convection correlations have 
been reported. No average correlations of any kind are given. 
Only radiation, in combination with forced convection, has been 
studied, for a limited set of conditions. 
Many other types of geometries might be considered. One 
example would be flames impinging normal to rectangular bars. 
This shape simulates a typical industrial application, where metal 
ingots are reheated prior to entering the rolling mill. There are 
also many combinations of fuels, oxidizers, and equivalence ra- 
tios that remain to be correlated. For example, very little work 
has been done for oxidizers other than either air or pure oxygen. 
Only a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of 
a furnace enclosure. Flame impingement heating represents an 
important technology that requires further experimental investi- 
gation.
