2. Experimental 
Cross sections and their angular distributions were 
measured using the 5SDH-2 pelletron at the Texas 
Center for Superconductivity, University of Houston. 
The maximum terminal voltage of the accelerator was 
1.7 MV. The energy range of 1.0-5.3 MeV wac covered 
by extracting single and double charged He-ions. En- 
ergy calibration was performed by resonance nuclear 
reaction in ?ANp. vlzwSi at 991.91 f O.tX keV. nuclear 
resonance in 160(o, aI”‘O at 3034 f 4 keV and nu- 
clear resonance in “Nt u. u )“N at 3576 f 3 keV. The 
target chamber was a standard RBS chamber with a 
rotatable detector-holder around the target. The boron 
targets were self-supported “B films of 500 A with “B 
abundance of 99%. The “B target was mounted in 
front of a Faraday cup of 9 cm oepth and 1.2 cm in 
diameter with a 5 mm aperture in front. This configu- 
ration of the target holder and Faraday cup was under 
+3ClO V for suppression of the secondary electrons 
from the front hole. Our measurement with and with- 
out the 300 V potential shows that the secondary 
electrons from this hole is less than 05%. so the error 
of the beam charge measurement with 300 V suppres- 
sion is negligible for relative cross section measure- 
ments. A silicon surface barrier detec!or with a 2 X 4 
mm aperture was placed 81 mm away f;srr: the beam 
spot. The vacuum in the target chamber was main- 
tained at pressure of 1 x I9 -’ Torr or bett:r with a 
turbomolecular pumping system. The energy resolution 
of the detection system was 18 keV. Energy calibration 
of the detection system was performed with backscat- 
tercd a-particles from a thin target of Au. Nb and MO.

backscattering peak and other ckneao ptdg are Wed scattered from “B target is shown in Fig 1. The “B 
peak was well separated from the “C-contamination 
peak as shown in the spectrum. The boron target was 
partially oxidized and oxygen was observed in the spec- 
trum. There arc Ca and Ba contaminations on the 
boron film as shown in the spectrum. Peaks from 
different elements were well separated and there was 
no interference from the C and 0 contamination peaks. 
The Ba peak due to contamination was used for an 
additional monitor as discussed befow. The spectra 
were collected with ND-9900 multichannel analyzer 
w’ h a ND-582 ADC. The dead-time during spectra 
collection was less than 1% and no correction was 
required. 
3. cross sectioa 
Integrated counts under the “B and Ba peaks were 
extracted from 188 Bsspectra and normalized by the 
collected ion beam charge for cross section eakuia- 
tions. The ~055 sections were -red at & - 165” 
f 0.3’. The angular spread from the front of the aper- 
ture of the detector was f 1’. The beam enerlly spread 
was less than 3 keV in the energy range from 32 MeV 
to 5.3 MeV and 2 keV from 1.0 to 3.2 MeV. All 
excitation functions and angular distributions were 
based on normalized ‘counts under peak”. 
The ratio of the cfoss seetton to the Rutherford 
cross section, u/a,. at the same energy of E can k 
calculated as: 
u/a,& El - 
l 
where A,(/:) and ARB(ER) are the counts under f3 
peaks for the energy E and the energy E,, respectively.

Ail integrated counts under tkc B peak An and An,. 
were normalized by integrating the beam current with 
the integrated counts under the Ba peak A, as a 
second monitor. The u/(I~ ranges from 1.0 to 5.3 
MeV, as shown in Fig. 2. 
E, was selected low enough to avotd cross section 
deviarion due to nuclear interaction. As Bozoian [9] 
tGnts out, the laboratory energy for a 4% cro~section 
.lcvl <*ion from a Rutherford cross x&m can be dc- 
fined as E,” - (m + .M)Z,Z2/8M (McV). The esti- 
mated energy from this simple expression is 1.7 MeV. 
Our r:~;:rimPntat meas**rement around 1.0 MeV is 
s)Iw~ ‘n Fig. 53 H ;th C ,I 1 .f. N’eV. The rz’io of *he 
cross s;ctton to the Kulherford value is dose to 1 and 
is constant within experimental error of ~2% for an 
energy range below 1.6 MeV. The measurement of 
McIntyre et al. also pointed out that the cross sedion 
on “9 is Rutherford between 1.n pnd 1.3 MeV. The 
normalization cross section at 1.0 MeV as Rutherford 
is reliable. Another possible deviation from the 
Rutherford cross section may be due to the electron 
shielding effect (F-factor) at low energy [IO]. The esti- 
mate shows a possible 0.02% cross section deviation,
