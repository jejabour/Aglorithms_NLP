The distribution and concentration of polycblorinated 
dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo- 
furans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in 
Humber Estuary bed sediment and in suspended 
particulate matter were extensively studied. Dioxin 
concentrations in sediments ranged from below detection 
to 3830 pg g-’ and PCB concentrations were from non- 
detectable to 84 ng g-‘. These concentrations were low in 
comparison to other estuaries. The concentrations of 
chlorinated organics were found to be correlated with 
sediment lipid content, which is a significant factor in 
determining the contaminant distribution in the Humber 
Estuary. Laboratory experiments were carried out using 
“C-radiolabelled compounds to determine partition 
coefficients (K,-,). A KD of 2.5 x lo5 was determined for 
2,3,7,8-TCDD and that of 6.4 x lo4 for 2,2’,5,5’-TCB; 
these did not vary significantly with salinity. There was no 
evidence in either the concentration data or the homolog 
profiles that contamination from tributaries to the 
Humber Estuary had penetrated the estuary in significant 
quantities. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd 
The occurrence of chlorinated organic compounds in 
the marine environment is of international concern 
due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation 
in the lipid tissues of marine biota (Delbeke & Joiris, 
1988; Gribble, 1994; Tanabe et al., 1994). Chlorinated 
organic compounds include dioxins comprising poly- 
chlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlor- 
inated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs). These compounds have not been 
well studied in the marine environment, but are again 
coming under closer scrutiny following the publication 
of a recent US EPA review of the toxicity of dioxins 
(US EPA, 1994a-c). The Humber Estuary, north-east 
UK, is considered to be an important source of 
pollutants to the North Sea (North Sea Task Force, 1993). Although high concentrations of dioxins have 
been detected in bed sediments at the mouth of the 
Estuary (Evers et al., 1993), Tyler et al. (1994) found 
little evidence of contamination in the lower Humber 
Estuary and other coastal sites around the UK. 
However, there are many possible sources of the 
chlorinated organics in the marine environment and 
concern has been expressed by the National Rivers 
Authority (NRA) over significant concentrations of 
dioxins in sediments in the vicinity of a chlorophenol 
plant located on a tributary to the River Rother 
(NRA, 1994), approximately 70 km south-east of the 
River Trent (Fig. la). The mechanisms by which 
dioxins may be transported from sources within 
estuaries is largely unknown, but the hydrophobic 
nature of these compounds suggests that particle- 
water interactions involving suspended particulate 
matter (SPM) could be significant (Murphy et al., 
1994; Hegeman et al., 1995). 
This paper presents the results of the first compre- 
hensive survey of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in bed 
sediments and SPM of the Humber Estuary and study 
of partitioning behaviour using 14C-labelled dioxin and 
PCB compounds. 
Materials and Methods 
Sampling 
Samples were collected during two surveys of the 
Humber estuary; a limited inter-tidal sampling survey 
carried out in summer 1991 by the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) as part of 
the CIROLANA 1991 cruise, and an extensive estuary 
survey in October 1993. Sediment samples were 
collected using a Shipek grab for sub-tidal samples 
and by hand for inter-tidal samples. All samples were 
stored in hexane-washed glass jars with foil cap liners. 
Suspended particulate matter was collected by bulk 
filtration (-750-1000 ml) through 0.7 pm hexane-

washed Whatman GF/F filters using an all glass 
apparatus. Between 100 and 290 mg was collected by 
this method. Filters were stored in hexane-washed foil 
wraps. All samples were stored in the dark at -20°C 
prior to analysis. 
Analysis 
Chlorinated organic compound analysis was carried 
out using established GC-MS methods (Pettit et al., 
1990) in accordance with agreed acceptance criteria and quality controls for PCDD/DF analysis (Ambidge et al., 
1990). Sediments were sieved through a 1 mm mesh and 
oven-dried at 40°C prior to analysis. Full analytical 
methodologies can be found in Tyler et al. (1994). All 17 
2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD and PCDF congeners were 
quantified together with the homolog totals (tetra- to 
octa-). Total PCB concentration and the ICES 7 
congeners (IUPAC numbers 28, 52, 101, 118, 153, 138 
and 180) were also resolved. Two full procedural ‘blind’ 
analyses were also submitted for analysis. These are

Apolar lipid content, defined operationally as the 
fraction partitioning into a two phase acetonehexane 
system, was determined on all sediments collected on 
the 1993 survey following an established method 
(Delbeke et al., 1990). Sediments were washed with 
Milli-Q water to remove salt and dried at low 
temperature. Samples were then extracted for 5 h in 
10% acetone n-hexane. Lipid content was determined 
gravimetrically following removal of the polar extract. 
Reproducibility on replicate samples was found to be 
better than 9% on five sample runs. 
Laboratory experiments 
To investigate the partitioning behaviour of dioxins 
and PCBs in the Humber Estuary, a series of mixing 
experiments were conducted using 14C-labelled com- 
pounds (Turner & Tyler, 1995). Such experiments allow 
partitioning behaviour to be studied under carefully 
controlled conditions without the difficulties encoun- 
tered in determining concentrations analytically. 
The experiments were conducted using river and 
marine end member samples containing SPM taken 
from the River Ouse and Humber Estuary. A simulated 
estuarine gradient was obtained by admixing the two end 
member samples. Radiolabelled 2,2’,5,5’-tetra- 
chlorobiphenyl-UL-‘4C (Sigma Chemical Co.), with 
specific activity of 13.32 mCi mmol-‘, or 2,3,7,8 
tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin-UL-14C (Radian 
Corporation), with specific activity of 33 mCi mmol- ‘, 
was used in the experiments. For each experiment 0.02 
uCi of the radiolabelled compound was added in solvent 
to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Following evaporation of the 
solvent, a 20 ml sample of natural water was added and 
the tube was shaken for 12 h. The tube was then 
centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 rpm to separate the 
suspended sediment. A 4 ml sample of the dissolved 
phase was removed and added to 10 ml of Ultima Gold 
scintillation cocktail (Canberra Packard). The particles 
were resuspended and flushed from the tube. The tube 
was then shaken with 4 ml hexane to remove the glass- adsorped 14C compound. Two millilitres of the hexane 
was then added to the scintillant and all samples were 
counted on a Philips 4700 scintillation counter. Each 
experiment was carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate 
and the partition coefficient, Ko, calculated by mass 
balance from determination of the dissolved phase 
oounts (CPM) and loss to the glass. The recovery of 
the 14C spike using this method was typically > 80%. 
Results and Discussion 
Concentrations and distribution 
A summary of the analytical results are given in Table 
2 with sample sites referenced in Fig. la. PCDD/DF 
analyses were summarized using the NATO/CCMS (or 
International) toxic equivalent factor (TEF) which sums 
the 17 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners on the basis of their 
toxic equivalence to 2,3,7,8-TCDD. 
Total PCDD/DF concentrations in the Estuary 
ranged from non-detectable to 3826 pg g- ’ (24.1 pg 
g -’ TEQ). Generally, these concentrations are elevated 
with respect to ‘background’ concentrations reported in 
the literature (e.g. total PCDD/DF between 10 and 100 
Pg g-l; Turkstra & Pols, 1989). Oehme et al. (1993) 
reported concentrations in the range 440-1400 pg gg ’ 
(5.5-17.2 pg g-’ TEQ; Nordic model) in northern 
North Sea waters. Previous work by these authors 
(Tyler et al., 1994) reported PCDD/DF concentrations 
in coastal North Sea sediments of 43-209 pg g-’ (0.6 
2.8 pg g-’ TEQ). Evers et al. (1993) reported PCDD/ 
D-F values in North Sea estuaries from 10064736 pg 
g 7 with two samples taken at a station at the mouth 
of the Humber Estuary with total PCDD/DF values of 
1846 pg g-’ ( sur ace, f < 63 pm) and 10 557 pg g- ’ (15 
cm, ~63 urn). No samples analysed as part of this 
survey reached concentrations as high as that of the 15 
cm depth samples analysed by Evers et (21. (1993), 
although surface samples concentrations were compar- 
able with these data. 
The distribution of total PCDD and total PCDF in the 
Estuary is shown in Figs la and lb. Generally, PCDD/ 
PCDF concentrations are higher in the finer accumu-

lated inter-tidal sediments than the coarser sub-tidal bed 
sediments. There appear to be higher concentrations in 
the inter-tidal sediments of the lower Estuary perhaps 
suggesting some anthropogenic input. The distribution 
of total PCBs is shown in Fig. 2 and shows similar 
patterns to the dioxin distribution, with concentrations 
ranging from non-detectable to 72 ng g-‘. 
Source identljication and homolog profile analysis 
PCDDs and PCDFs arise from a numbr of well 
characterized sources including incineration, domestic 
fires, vehicle exhausts and chemical manufacturing 
processes involving the use of chlorine and sewage 
sludge. Under certain conditions it is possible to 
elucidate the source of dioxins found in environmental 
samples by comparing their homolog profiles or 
congener patterns with characteristic source ‘finger- 
prints’ (Swerev & Ballschmiter, 1989). 
From the data in Table 2, no consistent pattern was 
observed between homolog profiles throughout the 
Estuary although many exhibited characteristics of 
combustion source profiles. It is likely in an indus- 
trialized estuary such as the Humber with several 
conurbations on its banks, that a multiplicity of diffuse 
and low concentration direct sources may exist. This 
will tend to confuse any potential source-occurrence 
matches between homolog profiles. Furthermore, the 
dynamic tidal environment of the Humber Estuary 
infers a reworking of sediments within the Estuary 
which could promote chlorination dependent differen- 
tial transport masking source-occurrence related effects 
(Tyler et al., 1994). 
The NRA public register (NRA, 1994) indicated TEQ 
concentrations up to 64000 pg g-’ in sediments of a 
tributary of the River Rother sampled in October 199 1. 
In 1993, the concentrations in these sediments close to 
the chlorophenol facility ranged from 5144 to 45 3 11 pg g -t TEQ. Although the industrial source is some 
distance from the Humber Estuary, there remains 
some concern over possible long-term transport from 
this site into the Estuary. Concentrations measured 
during this survey, particularly those samples taken in 
the River Ouse and River Trent, showed no evidence of 
any abnormal dioxin loads entering the Estuary. 
Furthermore a homolog profile analyis showed no 
obvious similarity between samples from sites near the 
chlorophenol plant and those from the Humber 
Estuary. 
Suspended sediment sample concentrations 
In addition to bed samples, suspended sediment 
samples were analysed for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. 
Suspended sediment represents a major transport 
pathway for such hydrophobic contaminants and is an 
important determinant in transport studies. Consider- 
able problems are apparent in collecting sufficient 
suspended sediment for analysis whilst avoiding gross 
contamination. Difficulty was encountered in achieving 
analytical detection limits. From nine samples analysed, 
PCDD/DF congeners could only be quantified in four 
samples. In these samples only 2,3,7,8 TCDD (34 pg 
g- ‘) and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8 HpCDD (14-20 pg g-‘) were 
detected. These concentrations are comparable with bed 
sediment concentrations and although the data should 
be treated with caution, there is an indication that the 
suspended sediment adsorbed dioxin is probably 
derived from resuspended bed sediment. Further work 
in this important area is required using bulk filtration 
techniques to obtain more material for accurate 
quantification of all major congeners.

tion of solid phase physicochemistry can be misleading. 
PCDD/DFs and PCBs are highly apolar compounds 
with a strong affinity for apolar lipid material. Estuarine 
particles may be coated with lithogenic humics (Murphy 
et al., 1994) or be contaminated with anthropogenically 
derived oil or fatty (e.g. sewage) deposits which render 
them preferential for contaminant adsorption. Previous 
work (Delbeke et al., 1990; Preston et al., 1993; Tyler et 
al., 1994) has demonstrated an association between 
hydrophobic organic compounds and apolar lipid 
content. This association is a key factor in determining 
the behaviour, transport and subsequent distribution of 
such compounds and as such apolar lipid content 
represents an ideal normalizing parameter for distribu- 
tion studies. 
Samples analysed on this survey have been correlated 
with sediment lipid content. Figure 3 shows a significant 
non-linear correlation between lipid content and total 
PCDD and PCDF and Fig. 4 shows the correlation with 
total PCB. A significant fit is found in all cases for a 
logarithmic relationship. Lipid content of sediments 
within the Estuary was generally low (non-detectable to 
3.28 mg g-l) compared with other estuaries studied (e.g. 
Clyde, non-detectable to 12.3 mg g-t). However, there 
was still considerable variation of lipid content within the 
Humber Estuary which appears to contribute signifi- 
cantly to the distribution of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs.

To establish a more representative picture of the 
distribution of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the 
Estuary, concentrations were normalized against lipid 
content. The resultant distributions are shown in Figs 
la, lb and 2. The effect of lipid normalization is to 
considerably reduce the spatial variation in PCDD, 
PCDF and PCB concentrations in sediments. The 
resulting distribution is remarkably homogenous. The 
hypothesis put forward for the observed homogeneity is 
two-fold. 
It has already been concluded from homolog profile 
analysis that considerable reworking of sediments 
within the Estuary may be masking source-related 
variations in concentration. Once sorption preference 
related effects have been removed (by lipid normal- 
ization) one would equally expect the observed 
homogeneity in distribution. To further support this 
hypothesis, the partitioning behaviour of dioxins and 
PCBs has been investigated with labortory experi- 
ments. 
Particle-water interaction studies 
Relatively few determinations of the partition 
coefficients for chlorinated organics exist in the 
literature, despite the fact that this function is an 
important component of the modelling of contaminant 
transport (Ng et al., in press). The partition coefficient is 
defined as: 
where C, is the concentration on the particles and C, is 
the concentration in solution. The values of C, and C, 
were determined from the mass balance of the 14C 
compounds used in the mixing experiments. The results 
are plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of salinity. The 
partition coefficients for 2,3,7,8-TCDD are about an 
order of magnitude higher than those for 2,2’,5,5’-TCB, 
reflecting the lower solubility of the former compound. 
In general these KDS are relatively low due to the lower 
apolar lipid content of particulate matter in the 
Humber. In addition, the partitioning of these organic 
compounds shows little variation as a function of 
salinity, as Hegeman et al. (1995) found for cosolvent 
partition coefficients for phenanthrene. Thus, the 
partitioning appears to buffer concentrations of the 
dioxins and PCBs and may be a factor contributing to 
the observed homogeneity in bed sediment concentra- 
tions. Furthermore, the mean residence time of particles

Conclusions 
Concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in the Humber 
Estuary whilst elevated above ‘background’ concentra- 
tions are comparatively low and below previously 
reported levels. There is no evidence of penetration to 
the Humber Estuary from sources of dioxins reported in 
the contaminated tributary, in either measured con- 
centrations or homolog profile analysis. 
Dioxin and PCB concentrations show a strong 
dependence on the apolar lipid content of the solid 
phase as reported in a number of other studies. Once the 
effects of bed sediment geochemistry are removed by 
lipid normalization, a homogeneity in dioxin and PCB 
distribution is observed. It is suggested that this is the 
result of sediment reworking and mixing within the 
Estuary. Further evidence supporting this hypothesis, 
derived from laboratory studies of partitioning beha- 
viour, shows dioxin and PCB partition coefficients are 
independent of salinity in the Humber Estuary. 
This work demonstrates the importance of solid 
phase geochemistry and the dynamics of estuarine 
sediment regimes in determining the distribution of 
organochlorine contaminants in estuarine environ-
