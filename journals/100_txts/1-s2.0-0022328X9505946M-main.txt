Abstract 
The water-soluble phosphine complex of Rh(I), RhCI(PTA) 3 (1) was shown to be an active catalyst for the hydrogenation of various 
olefinic and oxo-acids, as well as of allyl alcohol and 4-sulfostyrene in aqueous solution under mild conditions. Detailed kinetic 
investigations were carried out with crotonic acid and allyl alcohol as substrates. The rate of hydrogenation of both compounds showed a 
sharp maximum as a function of pH at 4.7. Hydrogenation of itaconic, crotonic and a-acetamidocinnamic acid in D20 led to 45-100% 
deuteration of the products with 25-100% stereoselectivity towards the a-carbon atom. These results, together with those of pH-static 
hydrogenation of complex 1, suggest that water strongly assists the dehydrochlorination of 1 to yield the catalytically active monohydrido 
species HRh(PTA) 3 (2). Nevertheless, depending on the substrate and the pH of the solution the dihydridic pathway may remain partially 
operative.

I. Introduction 
Aqueous organometallic chemistry has recently be- 
come a well-established, independent field of study 
aimed, in part, at developing biphasic catalytic pro- 
cesses for industrial (e.g. hydroformylation and poly- 
merization) and biological applications [1,2]. With re- 
spect to processes of industrial importance, it is antici- 
pated that in the future more environmentally benign 
processes will use water as a solvent or cosolvent [3]. A 
successful and widely used method to achieve water- 
soluble organometallic catalysts is by slight modifica- 
tion of ligands commonly found in catalytically active 
transition metal complexes, e.g. by sulfonation, 
aminomethylation, or carboxylation of phosphine lig- 
ands [4]. However, water is a highly polar solvent with 
the ability to form strong hydrogen bonds, and hence 
can intricately affect the mechanism of catalysis.

SSDI 0022-328X(95)05946-6 In the course of our investigations of aqueous 
organometallic catalysis we have discovered that the 
mechanism of the hydrogenation of activated olefins 
catalyzed by RhCIP 3 type (P = tertiary phosphine) com- 
plexes in aqueous solutions may contain two important 
steps not observed in olefin hydrogenation processes 
utilizing Wilkinson's catalyst in organic solvents. First, 
the sulfonated phosphines PPhnAr m (Ar=C6H4-m- 
SO3Na, n + m = 3; m = 1 TPPMS; m = 3 TPPTS) eas- 
ily add across an activated olefinic bond, like that in 
maleic acid, with the formation of the corresponding 
phosphonium salt [5]. This was shown, in the case of 
RhCI(TPPMS) 3, to lead to the formation of a phosphine 
deficient Rh(I) species [6]. Of alkenoic acids, E-2- 
butenoic (crotonic acid) reacted slowly with phosphines, 
and in that case the phosphonium salt formation did not 
influence the catalytic performance of RhCI(TPPMS) 3. 
Second, water facilitates the formation of HRh~Px 
monohydrido species rather than the dihydride H2Rh m 
CIP 3, where x is dependent on the nature and the 
amount of excess phosphine [7]. Both of these processes 
are pH-dependent.

Recently, we introduced the use of 1,3,5-triaza-7- 
phosphaadamantane (PTA) into organometallic catalysts 
in water [8,9]. It has been found that RhCI(PTA) 3, the 
analog of RhCI(TPPMS) 3, is an active catalyst for the 
selective reduction of unsaturated aldehydes to saturated 
aldehydes, using an aqueous sodium formate solution as 
the hydrogen source. One interesting property of PTA is 
that, despite being rather basic (pK a 6.0) [10], it does 
not react with activated olefins. Hence, the effects of pH 
on the kinetics of hydrogenations catalyzed by RhC1P 3 
systems can be studied in the absence of the side 
reaction between the phosphine and the olefinic sub- 
strate. By utilizing an unactivated olefin, this side reac- 
tion can be further prevented. A detailed kinetic study 
was therefore undertaken to reveal the relative impor- 
tance of the monohydridic and dihydridic pathways in 
hydrogenation of crotonic acid catalyzed by RhCI(PTA) 3 
in aqueous solution. In addition, the hydrogenation of 
several other substrates (olefinic acids, 2-oxo-acids, al- 
lyl alcohol, 4-sulfostyrene) was also investigated. 
2. Experimental details 
2.1. Materials 
PTA, RhCI(PTA) 3 and Z-a-acetamidocinnamic acid 
were prepared as described in the literature [8,11,12]. 
All other reagents were commercial products of Aldrich, 
Merck and Fluka and purified by recrystallization or 
distillation when necessary. For deuteration studies 
99.9% D20 from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories was 
used. 
2.2. General methods 
The extent of deuteration was calculated from the 
relative peak areas of I H NMR spectra of the products. 
NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker WP 200 SY 
spectrometer. Deuterium distribution in 2-acetamido-3- 
phenylpropionic acid was deduced from the MS frag- 
mentation pattern [13] of its methyl ester, obtained by 
esterification in HC1/methanol. Mass spectrometric 
measurements were made on a VG 7035 instrument 
(VG Analytical; direct sample introduction, 70 eV). 
2.3. Hydrogenation experiments required pH was used as solvent. In comparison with 
the unbuffered solutions of same pH, no specific salt 
effect was observed. In a typical experiment 20 ml of 
4.5 × 10 -2 M substrate solution was placed into the 
jacketed reaction flask under argon together with 6 mg 
(9.8 × 10 -3 mmol) solid RhCI(PTA) 3 in a small cup 
made of filter paper and hung on a stainless steel hook. 
The reactor and the burette were subsequently filled 
with H 2 with several evacuation/refill cycles. The tem- 
perature was kept constant to +0.1°C (typically at 
37°C) using a Lauda K4R circulator. Reactions were 
started by dissolving the catalyst in the substrate solu- 
tion. Independent of the experimental conditions, the 
reactions proceeded with no induction period and, there- 
fore, initial rates were calculated from volume readings 
in the first 5 min. In all measurements the rate of 
hydrogen consumption was less than 50% of that of H 2 
dissolution, as established by separate measurements 
under identical conditions, i.e. rate data were obtained 
in the truly kinetic region. 
2.4. Isomerization studies 
Isomerization of maleic to fumaric acid during the 
hydrogenation experiments was followed by high per- 
formance liquid chromatography (column: Nucleosil® 5 
C18 (Macherey Nagel); eluent: methanol/water, con- 
taining 0.1% phosphoric acid, 1/1; room temperature, 
isocratic mode) using a Waters 501 pump, a 490E 
programable UV-vis detector and the Maxima integra- 
tion software. 
2.5. pH-static titrations 
The jacketed reaction vessel was fitted with the base 
delivery tube of a Radiometer ABU 91 autoburette, a 
Radelkis OP08080 combined glass electrode connected 
to a PHM 93 pH meter, a gas inlet capillary and gas 
outlet tube connected to a bubbler. 50 ml doubly dis- 
tilled, deaerated water was placed into the reactor and 
thoroughly bubbled with argon. RhCI(PTA) 3 was added 
in solid form against an argon stream. After closing the 
reactor the starting pH was adjusted by manual opera- 
tion of the autoburette, the argon stream was changed 
for hydrogen and the solution was also stirred magneti- 
cally. The volume of base required to keep the pH 
constant was automatically recorded in time utilizing an 
IBM 486 PC. 
Hydrogen uptake measurements Were carried out us- 
ing a thermostatted constant pressure gas burette [14]. 
Generally, the pH of the reaction mixtures was adjusted 
by titrating the solution of the substrate acids with 
NaOH (0.2 M) until the desired pH (4.70) was attained, 
as established by direct pH measurements using a con- 
ventional glass electrode. However, during the pH-vari- 
ation studies an Na-phosphate buffer (0.1 M) of the 3. Results and discussion 
RhCI(PTA) 3 is an active catalyst for the hydrogena- 
tion of various water soluble unsaturated substrates 
under mild conditions (Scheme 1, Table 1).

In general, the hydrogenation rate of unsaturated 
fatty acids is greater than that of 2-oxo-acids. Strikingly, 
fumaric acid is hydrogenated approximately five times 
faster than maleic acid, contrary to the behavior of 
Wilkinson's catalyst, which, in organic solvents, is con- 
siderably more active for hydrogenation of cis-rather 
than trans-olefins [15]. In this respect, RhCI(PTA) 3 
resembles RhCI(TPPMS) 3 [16]. It is interesting to note 
that the fastest hydrogenation was observed with ita- 
conic acid, although methyl itaconate is reduced slowly 
with RhCI(PPh3) 3 in benzene [15]. During hydrogena- 
tion the originally yellow solutions slowly become 
brown, and the rate of this color change depends on the 
excess phosphine concentration, temperature, and pH of 
the solutions. 
Detailed kinetic investigations show that the rate of 
crotonic acid hydrogenation is first order in the catalyst 
concentration (Fig. 1), levels off with crotonic acid 
concentration (Fig. 2) and varies in a slightly non-linear 
way with the partial pressure of dihydrogen (Fig. 3). A 
small excess of PTA decreases the rate considerably, 
however, the reaction is not completely inhibited even 
at higher excess of the phosphine (Fig. 4). rate [mol/h]

All these findings could be interpreted in terms of a 
classical dihydridic mechanism [17] of hydrogenations 
catalyzed by Wilkinson-type rhodium phosphine com- 
plexes (CA = crotonic acid, BA = butyric acid): 
RhCl(PTA)3 + H 2 ~ (H)RRhCI(PTA)2 + PTA (1)

(2) 
(HCA) (H) RhCI(PTA)2 + H 2 
--* (H)zRhCI(PTA)2 + BA (3) 
Although this simplified scheme does not show all 
the possible elementary steps, the overall rate of such a 
reaction sequence should be independent of pH since no 
proton is involved in any of the consecutive reactions. 
Contrary to this observation, the hydrogenation of 
crotonic acid is very strongly influenced by the pH (Fig. 
5). The maximum rate occurs at pH 4.7, which coin- 
cides with the pK a of crotonic acid [18], hence it was 
necessary to study the hydrogenation of allyl alcohol 
and 4-sulfostyrene as 'non-ionizable' substrates as a 
function of pH as well. In both cases a maximum rate is 
achieved at pH 4.7. Therefore, this value refers merely 
to changes in the mechanism brought about by varying 
pH, and the incidence with the pK a of crotonic acid is 
only coincidental. 
Through the use of pH-static measurements, it has 
been established that in aqueous solutions the reaction 
of RhCI(PTA) 3 and H z results in proton liberation (Eq.

(4)) [9]. This reaction can be interpreted as a reductive 
dehydrochlorination of an intermediate Rh(III) dihy- 
dride which has previously been reported in the litera- 
ture [19]. The driving force for this process comes from 
the high solvation energy of the ionic products, particu- 
larly H +, in water [20]. In this respect RhCI(PTA) 3 
behaves similarly to RhCI(TPPMS) 3. 
RhCI(PTA) 3 + H 2 ~ HRb(PTA) 3 + C1- + H + (4) 
From the kinetic measurements it is highly probable 
that the monohydride, formed in reaction (4), catalyses 
the hydrogenation of crotonic acid through the follow- 
ing steps (L = PTA or H20): 
HRh(PTA)3 + CA ~ HRh(CA)(PTA)/+ PTA (5)

(7) 
[Rh(PTA)2L ] + + H 2 ~ HRh(PTA)2L + H + (8) 
It should be emphasized that numerous other equilib- 
ria, involving phosphine, water, chloride and carboxyl- 
ate coordination, and the reaction of the respective 
species with dihydrogen, should also be regarded. How- 
ever, all considerations result in the conclusion that part, 
if not all, of the product is formed on a pH-dependent, 
monohydridic pathway. 
This conclusion is supported by the results of deuter- 
ation experiments, where unsaturated acids were hydro- 
genated with H 2 in D20 catalyzed by RhCI(PTA) 3. The 
products were found to be extensively deuterated as 
illustrated in Scheme 2. 
(R = CHzCOOH, R' = H: itaconic acid; R = C6H5, R' 
= H: acetamidocinnamic acid; R = H, R' = CH3: cro- 
tonic acid) 
The distribution of deuterium at full conversion (Ta- 
ble 2) reveals some interesting differences between the 
R'-- CH2-- CH(R)--COOH (l)

three substrates studied. The sterically hindered ac- 
etamidocinnamic acid derivative is hydrogenated slowly, 
but it is fully deuterated and the label is exclusively on 
the a-carbon atom (3). This implies that hydrogenation 
proceeds on a pathway including a protonolysis (de- 
uterolysis) step similar to that in Eq. (7), and that H/D 
exchange on the rhodium is insignificant on this time 
scale (hours). Itaconic acid is also exclusively deuter- 
ated on the a-carbon (3), however, 45% of the product 
remains undeuterated (1) implying the dihydridic mech- 
anism is operative too. The dihydridic mechanism is 
even more significant when utilizing crotonic acid as 
the substrate, where 75% of the product formed results 
from that pathway and there is only a slight directing 
effect of the substituents, resulting in an almost even 
distribution of the label on the a- and fl-carbon atoms. 
Similar deuteration experiments have already been de- 
scribed in the literature using Rh(I) complexes of vari- 
ous sulfonated phosphines as catalysts [13]. Based on 
detailed NMR investigations it was concluded that la- 
beling of the products occurred via an [Rh]-H ~ [Rh]-D 
exchange, although a protonation step, as suggested 
here, could not be ruled out completely. It would be 
premature to speculate on the exact causes of the selec- 
tivity in the deuteration of the above substrates. How- 
ever, it is important to stress that in aqueous systems 
highly enantioselective hydrogenations [21] can be 
achieved only if (i) the probability of monohydridic 
mechanism is decreased, e.g. by a careful choice of pH, 
and/or (ii) the transfer of hydrogen from the metal 
center onto the olefin, and consequently the protonoly- 
sis, proceeds regio- and stereospecifically. 
Both dihydridic and monohydridic mechanisms give 
rise to the reversible formation of an intermediate 
rhodium-alkyl species (reactions (2) and (6)). If this 
potential equilibrium is not shifted significantly to the 
right, olefin isomerization may occur. Under standard 
reaction conditions (see Table 1), the formation of 
fumaric acid during the hydrogenation of maleic acid 
was not observed. This is in agreement with our expec- 
tations since in the RhCI(PTA) 3 catalyzed system fu- 
maric acid is much more reactive than maleic acid. 
However, when hydrogenations were carried out using 
5 v/v% H 2 in Ar, and the reactions were stopped at 
low conversions, 14-17% fumaric acid was detected by 
HPLC. This does not necessarily imply that reduction of 
maleic acid catalyzed by RhCI(PTA) 3 proceeds via 
isomerization to fumaric acid followed by hydrogena- 
tion; this pathway cannot be excluded but our kinetic 
results do not allow for this distinction. 
Formation of cis,fac-(H)zRhCI(TPPTS) 3 from 
RhCI(TPPTS) 3 and H2, in the presence of excess 
TPPMS, has been observed by 31p NMR, and the 
complex was found to be a poor hydrogenation catalyst 
[22]. The related complexes cis-mer-[LRh(H)(PTA)3] + 
(L= C1- or H20) and cis-[Rh(H)(H)(PTA)4]C1 were shown to form in the reaction of RhCI(PTA) 3 and H 2 in 
the presence of excess PTA [9]. This is in agreement 
with our finding that excess PTA decreases the rate of 
hydrogenation, but does not inhibit the reaction com- 
pletely. 
The temperature dependence of the overall rate in 
such a complex catalytic system obviously cannot be 
characterized by one activation energy. From measure- 
ments in the 10-60°C temperature range, a temperature 
quotient of 42 kJ mol-~ could be calculated for the 
hydrogenation of crotonic acid catalyzed by RhC1 
(PTA) 3. This value is fairly close to the activation 
energies established for maleic acid (52 kJ mol -l) and 
fumaric acid (54 kJ mol -I) hydrogenations in un- 
buffered aqueous solutions, catalyzed by RhCI(TPPMS) 3 
[161. 
4. Conclusions 
The studies described herein on the catalytic hydro- 
genation of simple water-soluble olefinic substrates with 
RhCI(PTA) 3 as catalyst illustrate the importance of 
ionic equilibria in aqueous organometallic catalysis. 
Specifically, the high solvation power of water facili- 
tates reactions with ionic products, such as reductive 
dehydrochlorination of Rh(III)-hydrides, changing the 
active rhodium species in the catalytic system. This 
changes the entire mechanism of the catalyzed reaction 
leading to unusual rates and selectivities as exemplified 
by the greater hydrogenation rate of fumaric acid rela- 
tive to maleic acid. It is concluded that knowledge of 
the effect of pH on the outcome of aqueous 
organometallic reactions and its control is essential in 
devising selective catalytic syntheses.
