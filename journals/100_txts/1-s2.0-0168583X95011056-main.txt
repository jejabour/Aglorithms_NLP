Abstract 
The response of amorphous SrTiO, @TO) films, deposited by sputtering on ST0 single crystalline substrates, to ihermal 
annealing has been investigated using 950 keV He+ ion channeling. During annealing, the amorphous films ( - 560 A thick) 
crystallize epitaxially with the underlying substrate by solid phase epitaxy (SPE). The crystallized films are defective. The 
defect level first decreases with increasing annealing temperature in the range of 400-800°C. and then increases with 
increasing temperature in the range of 800-l 100°C. This is thought to result from the competition during annealing between 
SPE and the formation of randomly oriented crystallit$s that becomes a dominant process at high temperatures. Tbe recovery 
of full crystallinity of the ST0 substrate with a 560 A thick amorphous layer requires a two-step annealing sequence, i.e., 
annealing at 800°C followed by annealing at I 100°C. The single crystal substrates with a thin ST0 amorphous layer up to 80 
i thick can be completely recovered by a single-step annealing at 1100°C for 30 min. 
1. Introduction 
Solid phase epitaxy (SPE) has been extensively studied 
for semiconducting materials [I]. In metal oxides [2,3], 
especially in ternary oxides, however, the probable exis- 
tence of multiple metastable crystalline phases and com- 
peting bonding mechanisms makes the understanding of 
SPE more difficult than in semiconductors. In spite of the 
difficulties, the studies of SPE of the ABO,-type com- 
pounds have recently attracted interest because of their 
unique electrical and optical properties. Among the 
ABO,-type compounds, SrTiO, (STO) is widely used as a 
substrate material for growth of high temperature super- 
conducting films and is often used as a barrier layer or 
intermediate layer in superconducting devices based on 
multilayer structures. The goal of the present work is to 
achieve a better understanding of the general nature of the 
recovery processes of ST0 surface that occur when amor- 
phous ST0 crystallizes by SPE. 
Until recently, there were only a few reported investiga- 
tions dealing with SPE of the ABO,-type materials. Some 
of these studies have been devoted to investigating the ion 
implantation and annealing behavior in LiNbO, for its use 
in the manufacture of optical waveguides [4-61, and some 
devoted to CaTiO, [7], BaTiO, [8,9] and ST0 [8,9,10-131. 
The first reported study of SPE of ion-beam amorphized

3536 5717. ST0 was made by White et al. [S]. In that study, they 
showed that the amorphous layers resulting from Pb ion 
bombardment could be recrystallized by the SPE process 
after annealing at moderate temperatures. Moretti et al. [9] 
implanted Nb ions in ST0 and BaTiO, and investigated 
the structures and oxidation states of the damaged layers. 
McCallum et al. [ 131 examined the effect of ambient water 
vapour on the epitaxial regrowth rate of amorphous ST0 
layers using a time resolved optical reflectivity technique. 
Recently, Simpson et al. [IO] proved that hydrogen, pro- 
vided by the dissociation of water molecules, is a catalyst 
in the crystallization of amorphous STO. In these reported 
works, all the amorphous layers were formed by ion 
implantation, and relatively low temperatures ( < 500°C) 
were used for annealing ST0 in order to examine the 
regrowth kinetics. 
The present work investigates the annealing behavior of 
amorphous ST0 layers formed on ST0 single crystal by 
sputter deposition, and extends the annealing temperature 
to 1100°C. The results show that the regrowth behavior of 
the amorphous ST0 is a strong function of annealing 
temperature, and a two-step annealing sequence is required 
for the full recovery of crystallinity. 
2. Experimental details

strates by rf sputtering of a stoichiometric target at room 
temperature. The base pressure in the chamber was 2 X

10e7 Torr. During deposition the chamber was filled with 
Ar/O, mixture of 50 m Torr with an Ar/O, ratio of 3 : 1. 
Most of the layers were _ 560 A thick. A number of 
layers with thickness ranging from 10 A to 260 A were 
also made in order to study the thickness dependence of 
the recovery behavior. ST0 substrates with (100) orienta- 
tion were used primarily, although limited studies were 
also carried out using ST0 (I IO) substrate. The samples 
were annealed in an oven in 1 atm flowing oxygen at 
temperatures in the range of 400- 1100°C for time periods 
ranging from 5 min to 10 h. 1200 SrTiO,/SrTiO,( 100)

STO(100) substrates were examined by RBS-channel- 
ing prior to the deposition of amorphous ST0 layers. The 
minimum yield xmin of 1.3% and the surface peak area 
(SPA) of around 3.0 atoms/row were measured, demon- 
strating the high quality of the surface. In the annealing 
process all samples were very rapidly inserted into and 
removed from the preheated oven to minimize the effects 
of warm-up and cool-down. 800

The regrowth characteristic was studied as a function of 
annealing temperature and time. Fig. 1 shows the ion 
channeling results obtained after anneaiing at various tem- 
peratures and for various periods of time. The data for 
400°C annealing is not shown in Fig. 1. In fact, we did not 
observe any noticeable change in the aligned spectrum 
after annealing at 400°C for 15 min. Further annealing at 
400°C for 10 h resulted in only a slight reduction of the 
height of Sr signal in the channeling spectrum. This is not 
expected for ion amorphized STO, where the regrowth rate 
is about 1 i/s at 300°C and 30 min annealing at 400°C is 
enough to recrystallize a - 1800 A thick amorphous ST0 
layer [8]. The difference in regrowth behavior between 
ion-amorphized and deposited ST0 is possibly due to the 
difference in the microstructure of the interface. While ion 
implantation produces an end-of-range region, deposited 
samples usually have a sharp and possibly contaminated 
interface. After a sample was annealed at 500°C for 15 
min. the aligned yield from the deposited region was 
greatly reduced (Fig. I a) demonstrating that the amorphous 
film crystallized epitaxially with the underlying substrate. 
We can see that the epitaxial growth of the amorphous 
film is completed after annealing at 500°C for 15 min, but 
significant residual defects are present in the lattice. Fig. 
lb shows that annealing at 800°C leads to the epitaxial 
growth of an ST0 layer with less residual defects. How- 
ever, if a sample is annealed at 900°C (Fig. lc), the Fig. I RBS channeling spectra of recrystallization of SrTiO,( 100) 
crystals coated with a - 560 a thick amorphous SrTiOs layer. 
Samples were annealed in 1 atm flowing 0, at temperatures in the 
range of 400- 1100°C for time periods ranging from 5 min to 10 h. 
residual defect level is higher than that obtained after 
annealing at 8OO”C, and the shape of the aligned spectrum 
is different from those shown in Fig. la and Fig. lb. Fig. 
lc shows that this annealing treatment has caused the 
amorphous/crystal (a/c) interface to advance toward the 
surface, and the near surface region is highly defective. 
When a sample is annealed at 1 lOO”C, the results shown in 
Fig. Id suggest a layer-by-layer crystallization for the first 
30 min during which the a/c transformation occurs at the 
interface that moves toward the !urface. For the first 30 
min, the average growth rate is 6 A/min. This is far lower 
than the reported value for ion beam amorphized ST0 at 
400°C [8]. The results shown in Fig. 1 suggest two types of 
growth behavior upon annealing. The annealing at temper- 
atures ranging from 500 to 800°C causes a rapid epitaxial 
growth of the amorphous film with the underlying sub- 
strate and results in the growth of a defected iayer. At 
higher temperatures ranging from 900 to 1 100°C. the 
annealing treatment results in a slow movement of the 
interface toward the surface and a large disorder concentra- 
tion in the film. It is well-established [1] that two compet- 
ing processes exist in solid phase crystallization during lid circle: 15min

annealing. One is the continuous a/c transformation at the 
interface that moves toward the surface. The other one is 
the nucleation and growth of randomly oriented crystallites 
in the amorphous layer. During annealing, SPE dominates 
at relatively low temperatures, but the random nucleation 
and growth become the dominant crystallization process at 
higher temperatures. Reports on our recent TEM investiga- 
tion are now in preparation. The cross-section micrographs 
demonstrate that the SPE of the amorphous ST0 had been 
completed before the randomly oriented crystallites built 
up in the temperature range of 400-800°C; however, at 
high temperatures ranging from 900 to 1 lOO”C, a number 
of randomly oriented crystallites were formed on the sam- 
ple surface, and thereby interrupted the regular progression 
of the epitaxial growth front. Therefore, the interface 
movement implied by Fig. Id is not a real a/c transforma- 
tion, but it shows the transformation of randomly oriented 
crystallites to single crystal, thus explaining the very slow 
regrowth rate observed for the amorphous ST0 at 1100°C. 
Because of these two competing crystallization pro- 
cesses, the highest temperature does not result in the 
growth with the lowest defect level. We normalized the 
total number of displaced atoms per square centimeter in 
the recrystallized layer to the atom density of the layer. We 
will refer to this as the normalized disorder concentration. 
Fig. 2 shows the normalized disorder concentration in the 
recrystallized region as a function of annealing tempera- 
ture. Starting from 4OO”C, the residual defect level de- 
creases with increasing annealing temperature and reaches 
the lowest value at 8OO”C, then increases rapidly with 
increasing temperature beyond 800°C. 
Fig. 3 shows the normalized disorder concentration in 
the recrystallized region as a function of annealing time. It 
is a common phenomenon in these samples that the re- 
sponse to annealing is not linear in time. We observed that 
upon annealing, except in the case of 1 lOO”C, most changes 
occurred within the first five minutes, and then saturated. 
This indicates that although annealing at 800°C results in 
the epitaxial growth with the lowest disorder concentra- 549 
tion, this one-step annealing at 800°C does not result in 
very high crystalline quality. 
A two-step annealing procedure can be used to produce 
high crystalline quality. The first stage is an annealing at 
800°C which results in the growth of the least defected 
layer. Subsequently a high temperature treatment at 1100°C 
is applied to further reduce the residual defect level. A 
similar treatment has been extensively used for the recov- 
ery of GaAs and other III-V semiconductors [ 14,151. Fig. 
4 shows the aligned spectra for a sample that was first 
annealed at 800°C for 5 min followed by annealing at 
1100°C for 30 min. The sample recovered by this two-step 
annealing process has xrmn and SPA values of 2.5% and 3 
atoms/row, respectively, comparable to those of the sub- 
strate before coating.

4.8 atoms/row, respectively. Both these values are higher 
than those of STO(100) substrate. The substrates were 
coated with an amorphous ST0 layer by sputtering in the 
same way as for STO(100) substrates. We found that 
annealing at 500°C for 30 min did not cause any noticeable 
change in the aligned spectrum. Fig. 5 shows the response 
of a sample to thermal annealing at 800°C. It can be seen 
that after annealing at 800°C the interface moved toward 
the surface by about 200 A but a high density of defects 
remained near the surface. Annealing at 1100°C shows a 
similar behavior. Similar to the case of STO(100) sub- 
strate, the response of the STO(l 10) samples to annealing 
is not linear in time, and the residual defect level also 
saturates. Compared to STO( lOO), it seems that the forma- 
tion of the randomly oriented crystallites in STo(llO)

tures than in STO(100) case, implying that the a/c trans- 
formation rate at the STO(l10) interface is lower than that 
in STO(100). Whether this direction dependence of crystal- 
lization behavior is due to the poorer surface quality of 
STO(l10) substrate or due to intrinsic growth kinetics is 
not clear yet. 
3.3. Thin amorphous layers 
We found it easier to recover ST0 crystal surface 
coated with a thin amorphous layer [16]. When the amor- 
phous layer is thin enough, the two-step annealing proce- 
dure is not necessary, and annealing at 1100°C for 30 min 
resulted in high quality recrystallization of an amorphous 
layer up to a certain thickness. In this simple annealing 
treatment, it did not make a great difference whether the 
sample is inserted into the oven quickly or slowly. Fig. 6 
shows [lOOI-aligned spectra for an ST0 substrate with an 
80 A thick amorphous layer. After annealing at 1100°C for 
30 min. the channeling yield of the annealed sample is 
indistinguishable from that of virgin crystal, demonstrating 
the complete recovery of the surface. We found that the 
thickness limit for the complete recovery is 80 A. Fig. 7 
shows the SPA values of several samples after annealing 
for 30 min as a function of annealing temperature. It shows 
that the recovery of full crystallinity requires annealing at 
llOO”C, and after 30 min a’, 1100°C all samples with 
amorphous layers up to 80 A thick possess almost the 
same SPA value that is equal to that of virgin crystal. 
AFM measurements carried out on selected samples indi- 
cate that the recrystallized ST0 substrates have atomfcally 
flat surface with root-mean-square roughness of 1.2 A.

substrates have been carried out using 950 keV He+ ion 
channeling. During annealing, the - 560 ,& thick amor- 
phous layers crystallize epitaxially with the underlying 
substrate by SPE. The crystallized films are defective. The 
defect level first decreases with increasing annealing tem- 
perature in the range of 400-8OOT, and then increases 
with increasing temperature ranging from 800-l 1OU*C. 
This is due to the competition during annealing between 
SPE and the formation of randomly oriented crystallites 
that is the dominant process at high temperatures. The 
recovery of full crystallinity requires a two-step annealing 
sequence. The first stage is an anneal at 8OO”C, which 
results in the growth of the layer with low defect level. 
Subsequently the sample is annealed at 1100°C to further 
reduce the residual defects. The films crystallized by this 
two-step annealing treatment have the crystalline quality 
comparable to that of virgin crystal. For crystallization of 
thin amorphous layers, however, the two-step annealing 
procedure is not necessary. We found that single*crystal 
substrates with a thin amorphous layer up to 80 A thick 
can be completely recovered by a single-step annealing at 
1100°C in iatm O2 for 30 min.
