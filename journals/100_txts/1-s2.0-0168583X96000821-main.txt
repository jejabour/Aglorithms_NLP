Abstract 
Lead-silicate glassy thin films have been obtained by means of RF Magnetron Sputtering under different plasma gas 
mixtures and using different sputtering targets. The resulting coatings composition, microstructure and their optical and 
electrical properties have been studied by means of several experimental techniques, i.e.: nuclear analysis, Raman 
spectroscopy, ellipsometry and DC electrical conductivity. 
1. Introduction 
Lead-silicate glassy coatings deposited by Reactive Ra- 
dio Frequency Magnetron Sputtering (RRFMS) from a 
glass target have been recently used in the development of 
Micro Strip Gas Chamber radiation detectors [l-3]. In 
these devices a sheet resistance in the range 1014-10’5 
fl/ 0 is required in order to avoid the electrostatic charg- 
ing of the insulating medium supporting the metallic strips 
during charged particles bombardment [4,5]. Depending on 
the deposition parameters the deposited layers can exhibit 
physical properties quite different from those of the start- 
ing material. In order to obtain stable and reproducible 
electrical properties the effects of the main deposition 
parameters have been previously studied in some detail 
and reported in Refs. [6-81. It has been found, in particu- 
lar, that the sputtering gas composition is very important in 
modifying the physical properties of the deposited layers: 
in fact the films deposited in oxidizing plasmas (Ar + 5% 
0,) are yellowish and show a high electrical resistance 
similar to that of bulky lead glasses. On the contrary, films 
obtained in Ar + 20% H, reducing plasmas absorb more 
in the visible range showing a brownish colour. These 
films contain metallic lead nanoclusters clearly detected by 
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). As a function of the film thick- 
ness their room temperature sheet resistance ranges be- 
tween lo3 and lo* 9/O. The electrical conductivity 
measurements vs. temperature reveal that the thinner films 
(thickness I 500 nm) conduct by electron tunnelling be-

mal Coefficient of Temperature (TCR). In thicker films an 
inversion of TCR, explained by the formation of a perco- 
lating metallic structure, is observed. Films deposited in 
pure Ar (99.9999%) plasma have a higher conductivity 
than those obtained in the oxidizing plasma, demonstrating 
the reducing nature of the pure Ar sputtering gas: their 
sheet resistance ranged between 10” and 1016 0/O for 
film thicknesses in the range 100-1000 nm. These films 
show a strong temperature dependence characterized by a 
negative TCR. Metallic lead clusters are not detected in 
these films by X-ray diffraction, but the presence of re- 
duced Pb is inferred from X-ray Photoelectron Spec- 
troscopy (XPS) and by the coalescence of metallic lead 
after vacuum annealing (not found in films deposited in 
oxidizing plasmas) [9]. The conduction mechanism is 
thought to be dominated by hopping between electronic 
localized states within the energy gap or by thermally 
activated electronic processes in the band tails. 
Since depositions performed using plasmas with 0, 
content down to 1% exhibit electrical behaviour equivalent 
to those deposited with higher 0, contents, one effective 
way of practically controlling the Pb reduction in these 
films in order to tailor their electrical resistance to the 
specific applications is to vary the hydrogen content in the 
sputtering gas. 
The aim of this work is to extend to mildly reducing 
gas mixtures (Ar + O-6.8% HZ) the previous investiga- 
tions of the transport properties of lead-silicate thin films 
deposited by RRFMS. Since for these films XRD is not 
useful for structural analysis, we adopted a multitechnique 
approach using nuclear surface analysis, Raman scattering

and ellipsometry in order to gain insight into their micro- 
structure. 
2. Experimental 
Several sets of films were deposited from two different 
glass targets by RRFMS at 13.56 MHz, 45 W RF power, 
1.1 X lo-* mbar of total pressure in different gas mix- 
tures, whose compositions are given in Table 1. The films 
were deposited on Si single crystals for ellipsometric and 
compositional measurements and on Al,O, single crystals 
for Raman and DC conductivity measurements. Target no. 
1 was used for depositions 1 to 7, deposition no. 8 being 
obtained from target no. 2. For depositions from target no. 
1 the target DC self bias was - 1204 10 V. It was 
-5.5 & 5 V for depositions no. 8. In order to minimize 
both the formation of stressed structures and the re-sputter- 
ing effect due to energetic ion bombardment, the samples 
were mounted on an electrically insulated sample holder. 
The electric impedance (B13.56 MHz) of the holder was 
originally chosen in order to maximize the floating poten- 
tial during deposition [lo] thus reducing the Ar+ energy to 
about 10 eV for the RF power involved in the depositions. 
One drawback of this method is that the samples are 
subjected to an enhanced low energy electron bombard- 
ment from the plasma that can set up a thermal gradient 
between the films and the sample holder. 
The compositions of both targets and deposited layers 
were determined by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrome- 
try (RBS) using the HVEC AN2000 Van de Graaff accel- erator at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro with an 
cu-particle ion beam of 1.8 MeV. The films thicknesses 
were measured using a stylus profilometer (Tencor Instru- 
ments, model Alpha-Step 200). 
The electrical measurements were performed on sam- 
ples 1 to 4. Sheet resistance was measured as a function of 
sample temperature in the range 90-300 K in a vacuum 
chamber (5 X 10m6 mbar) with an electrometer (Keithley 
Instruments, model 237 High Voltage Source Measure 
Unit), after evaporating gold electrodes. 
Ellipsometry measurements were performed on samples 
5 to 7 using the MOSS ellipsometry spectrometer made by 
SOPRA. The experimental apparatus and the data analysis 
methods are detailed in Ref. [l 11. 
For Raman scattering experiments a standard apparatus 
was used. During the measurements the samples were held 
in an evacuated optical cryostat, to avoid any contamina- 
tion with the air moisture. Both VV and HV polarized 
Raman scattering spectra were measured at room tempera- 
ture in 90” geometry under excitation of the 514.5 nm line 
of an Ar+ ion laser operated at 500 mW. The incident 
laser beam formed an angle of 50” with the sample normal. 
In VV spectra the polarization was perpendicular to the 
scattering plane for both incident and scattered radiation, 
while in HV spectra the incident beam polarization be- 
longed to the scattering plane. The scattered radiation was 
analyzed by a 1 meter focal length double-pass monochro- 
mator (Jobin-Yvon, Ramanor model HG2-S) equipped with 
holographic gratings (2000 line/mm) and detected by a 
cooled GaAs photomultiplier tube (RCA, model 31034A- 
02) operated in photon counting mode and interfaced to a

cm-’ for most part of the measurements and the spectra 
were recorded at data intervals of 1 cm- ‘. Under these 
experimental conditions a good signal to noise ratio was 
obtained. Raman spectra were always superimposed on a 
nearly flat luminescence background, extending over the 
whole scanned spectral range. 
3. Results and discussion 
The compositions and thicknesses of the films are 
summarized in Table 1. The deposited films turn out richer 
in lead than the targets. This behaviour is expected and it 
is due to thermalization of the sputtered particles in the gas 
mixture, as discussed in Ref. [8]. 
The Arrhenius plots of some DC conductivity measure- 
ments are shown in Fig. 1. The room temperature sheet 
resistance of the films deposited in oxidizing plasma was 
higher than 5 X lOI fi/ El. The-DC conductivity of the 
films deposited in Ar + 6.8% H, gas mixture is many 
orders of magnitude higher and has a much weaker tem- 
perature dependence than that of films obtained in less 
reducing atmosphere. This behaviour was also found in 
films of comparable thickness deposited in Ar + 20% H, 
[71. 
The films deposited in pure Ar show a conductivity 
higher than those deposited in Ar + 3.3% H,. This appar- 
ently surprising finding suggests that the control of the gas 
composition and sputtering power is not sufficient for 
granting the reproducibility of the electrical properties. We 
attribute this fact to the temperature of the growing film 
which (as pointed out in the introduction) depends on the 
rate of electron bombardment from the plasma. In fact, during the Ar deposition, the sample holder floating poten- 
tial turned out the highest of all depositions. This implies a 
higher temperature of growth which is thought to enhance 
the chemical reduction effectiveness. The study of the 
effects of the sample deposition temperature in the range 
of 20-80°C on the electrical properties is under study and 
will be presented in a forthcoming paper. 
Usually the first step for determining the electrical 
conduction mechanism is to find a linear dependence of 
the logarithm of the resistivity versus (l/Tjm. Different 
values of m give an indication about the mechanism 
dominant in each temperature range [12,13]. From the 
analysis of such plots with m varying from i to 1 (not 
reported here) it is impossible to assign a single conduc- 
tion mechanism to our films in the temperatures between 
90 and 300 K: a transition between two different mecha- 
nisms undoubtedly occurs at about 240 K. Furthermore the 
identification of the transport mechanism in the 90-240 K 
range would require an extension of the electrical measure- 
ments to even lower temperatures. The best fits of our data 
were obtained with m < 4, thus ruling out the occurrence 
of electronic conduction by thermal excitations to extended 
states, nearest neighbour hopping [12] and also tunnelling 
between isolated metallic clusters [ 131. 
From the extinction coefficient k(w) obtained from the 
ellipsometric data, the absorption coefficient (Y(W) = 
47rk(w)/A has been calculated. In Fig. 2 a(o) is plotted 
vs. energy in the region between 1.4 and 3.0 eV. In this 
region the refraction index n( o) was in the range 1.8-2.2 
showing a slight increase with frequency. A broad optical 
absorption bump in the range 1.6-2.4 eV, just below the 
absorption edge, is observed in the films deposited in pure 
Ar and Ar + 3.3% H,, while nothing similar is present in 
the films obtained in oxidizing atmosphere. In principle 
this raise of (Y(W) below the absorption edge could be 
attributed to excitation of either defect states in the gap or 
surface plasmons in small Pb clusters. However this last

possibility can be ruled out since the surface plasmon 
resonance of metal Pb particles, in lead implanted silica, 
has been observed to occur at 5.2 eV [14]. This conclusion 
is further supported by the results of low energy Raman 
scattering measurements, as it will be detailed later. 
In Fig. 3 the full experimental Stokes Raman spectra 
obtained in both VV and HV polarizations for films no. 8 
and target no. 2 are plotted. Both VV and HV Raman 
spectra of the target lead glass in the region below 200 
cm-’ are dominated by the broad band peaked at about 35 
cm- ’ (the so-called “ boson peak”, typical of all glassy 
systems), while two additional, less intense structures oc- 
cur at about 100 and 135 cm- ‘. The high energy region 
(above 200 cm- ‘> consists of much broader and less 
intense spectral features extending up to 1100 cm-‘. The 
overall VV and HV spectra of our target no. 2 are similar 
to those reported for bulk lead glasses of composition 
between PbO-2Si0, and PbO-3Si0, [ 15-171. RBS anal- 
ysis of the target gives a slightly lower PbO molar fraction. 
The two features at 100 and 135 cm- ’ are related to the 
presence of lead in the glass [ 171. The band peaking at 135 
cm-’ is assigned to the Pb-0 symmetric stretching mode 
in pyramidal units [15-171. No definite attribution of the 
origin of the 100 cm- ’ band exists [ 16,171, although 
Worm1 and Henshall [ 161 claim that it is due to the 
presence of Pb2+ ions in the glass lattice. Moreover, in 
bulk lead glasses, the relative intensity of the 135 cm-’ 
band with respect to that of the 100 cm-’ strongly in- 
creases with increasing PbO content [15,16]. This be- 
haviour suggests that the arrangement of Pb ions in pyra- 
midal groups is strongly favoured in lead silicate glasses 
with high PbO.

in Fig. 4. As discussed above, the presence of the boson 
peak reveals the glassy nature of the coating. The intensity 
of the structure peaking at 135 cm-’ turns out remarkably 
enhanced with respect to the boson peak, resulting in a 
well resolved band, while the feature at 100 cm-’ is 
lacking. 
The spectra of Fig. 4 do not reveal the occurrence of 
any scattering attributable to the presence of metal Pb 
particles. This scattering is observed provided that the 
excitation energy is nearly resonant with the particle sur- 
face plasmon peak and should result into a well resolved 
Raman peak in the region below about 20 cm-‘. Such a 
peak, originating from acoustic vibrational modes localized 
at the metal particle surface, has been observed for silver 
colloids embedded either in crystals 1181 or glass films 
[19]. The absence of this kind of signal in the spectra of 
Fig. 4, confirms that the band observed in ellipsometric 
measurements cannot be attributed to the metallic Pb 
surface plasmons, being the laser excitation line nearly 
resonant with the optical absorption band. 
4. Conclusions 
Lead-silicate glassy films were deposited by RF mag- 
netron sputtering using Ar plasmas containing different 
concentrations of H, and 0,. The DC conductivity mea- 
surements show that the electrical conduction in the films 
obtained using mildly reducing plasmas involves localized 
electronic states in the gap. The ellipsometry measure- 
ments show, in these films, an optical absorption enhance- 
ment in the region 1.6-2.4 eV due to the presence of 
electronic states in the gap. This is not observed in the 
films obtained in oxidizing plasmas, which result transpar- 
ent and highly insulating.

The preliminary investigations of the films microstruc- 
ture carried out by Raman Spectroscopy conk-m the glassy 
nature of the deposited films and seem to indicate a 
preferential arrangement of the Pb ions in pyramidal units. 
These measurements don’t allow to detect the presence of 
small Pb metal colloids in the films deposited in mildly 
reducing plasma. 
Parameters other than the plasma composition have 
been found to influence the reproducibility of the electrical 
properties. The film growth temperature plays an important 
role in determining the reducing effect of the plasma.
