Abstract 
Thin BN films (100-250 nm) have been deposited on Si( 100) substrates in a double-ion-beam sputtering system from a 
h-BN target. The films have been characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and spectroscopic phase-modulated ellipsometry as a 
function of the deposition and irradiation parameters. Assistance with Ar + ions result in boron rich films with refraction 
indexes above 2 or even higher as the deposited energy of the assisting ions increases. N:-bombardment causes 
stoichiometric and even nitrogen-rich BN films characterized by refraction indexes around 1.85. The stability of the films is 
enhanced when the deposited energy of the N, + ions is above 30 eV/atom and/or the deposition is performed on substrates 
at temperatures above 100°C. 
1. Introduction 
A number of different techniques have been applied for 
the synthesis of BN films. Recent reviews of these meth- 
ods are to be found in the literature [l--S]. These include 
ion-assisted deposition, mainly based on the evaporation of 
both BN and pure B assisted by nitrogen ions. Here we 
report the results of a study of BN, films prepared in a 
double-ion-beam sputtering system. The main aim is to 
determine the deposition parameters that result in stable 
transparent coatings. For that purpose we present an opti- 
cal characterization of the BN, films in terms of FT-IR 
spectroscopy and phase-modulated spectroscopic ellipsom- 
etry. were Si(100) wafers cleaned in a HF + methanol solution 
(50% in volume). Both the substrate and the target were 
sputter-cleaned with a low energy Ar+ beam before the 
deposition was started. 
2. Experimental 
The BN, films were deposited in a dual-ion-beam 
sputtering system at a base pressure of lo-’ Torr. A 3 cm 
Kaufmann-type ion source was used for sputtering of a BN 
target (97.5% purity) from Cerac Inc. The angle of inci- 
dence of the beam was 45” from the target normal. An 
end-Hall ion source was used for low energy N:- and 
Ar+-bombardment of the growing film. The angle of inci- 
dence was 60” from the substrate normal. The substrates The ion current density and the ion energy of both ion 
sources were changed in order to investigate the effect of 
the energy input of the assisting ions on the structural and 
optical properties of the BN films. A summary of the 
deposition conditions is outlined in Table 1. The reduced 
energy is an estimate of the deposited energy per arriving 
atom determined in terms of the current density, energy of 
the impinging ions, growth rate and atomic density of 
h-BN. The samples have been labeled as A- and N- for 
Ar+- and NC-assisted samples, respectively, and as NA- 
for the non-assisted film. Although the sample holder was 
cooled by water, the temperature can increase up to 85°C 
depending on the conditions of the deposition. Some films 
were deposited maintaining the substrate temperature at 
100, 150 and 200°C. The temperature is controlled through 
a thermocouple by a microprocessor-based controller. In 
other cases the substrate was biased to increase the energy 
of the ions.

3. Results and discussion 
In Fig. 1 a series of IR spectra of several films obtained 
under different conditions (see Table 1) is shown. The 
spectra correspond to the non-assisted film and Ar+- and 
N:-assisted samples as labelled. Although all the spectra 
show a rather broad peak in the 1300- 1400 cm-’ range 
due to in-plane B-N bond stretching and a smaller one 
located at 750-800 cm-’ associated with B-N-B bond- 
bending (out of plane), they show significant differences in 
both the broadness and the wavenumbers of the absorption 
bands. In Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b we have represented the 
wavenumber and the full width at one half maximum 
(FWHM) of the main absorption band as a function of the 
reduced energy (i.e., average delivered energy per de- 
posited atom). Data of those N-films which were deposited 
on hot substrates have been depicted with a different 
symbol. 
Fig. 2a shows that the wavenumber of the main band is 
always lower for Ar+-assisted than for NT-assisted films. 
This clearly indicates that the average intralayer B-N bond 
length is larger for the A-films than for the N-films. In 
fact, Fig. 2a shows that the N-films reach values between 
1380 and 1400 cm-‘, usually found in the literature for 
stoichiometric h-BN [ 11, whereas the wavenumber for the 
Ar+-assisted films remains always below 1340 cm-‘. In I - 1 ’ I ’ I ’ I *, . , -

Reduced Energy (eV/atom) 
Fig. 2. In plane B-N bond stretch wavenumber (a) and full width 
at one-half peak maximum intensity (b) as a function of the 
reduced energy (eV/atom) for BN, films: non-assisted (0). 
Ar+-assisted (m), NC-assisted (0) and Nl-assisted at different 
substrate temperatures (0 1. 
addition, it is shown that the dependence on the deposition 
parameters is stronger for A-films than for N-films. In the 
last case, the data suggest a small decrease of the 
wavenumber when the reduced energy is below 30 
eV/atom, obviously tending to the value measured for the 
non-assisted film. The measured wavenumber for the non- 
assisted and Ar+-assisted films at low reduced energies is 
around 1320 cm-’ and, although it increases slightly up to 
1340 cm- ’ for 50 eV/atom, rapidly decreases below 1300 
cm-’ at reduced energies above 100 eV/atom. Fig. 2b 
shows that the FWHM of the IR-absorption band associ- 
ated with the B-N bond stretch also depends on the 
deposition parameters. It is greater for non-assisted and 
A-films ( = 300 cm-‘) than for nitrogen assisted films 
(260 cm-- ‘1 indicating a greater statistical distribution 
about the average intralayer B-N bond length (i.e., larger 
disorder). 
Interestingly the influence of the substrate temperature 
was more significant in N-films than in A-films. For films 
grown under NC-bombardment it was observed that depo- 
sition on hot substrates caused a significant decrease in the 
width of the IR-absorption bands (cf. Fig. 2b) as well as an 
increase in the wavenumber for films deposited at low 
reduced energies (cf. Fig. 2a). The effects are obviously due to the relocation of the components in a more ordered 
structure. In the case of substoichiometric films (i.e., A- 
films) the effect is much weaker and probably requires 
higher temperature. It is worth mentioning that any fea- 
tures attributable to c-BN were absent from all the spectra 
presented here. 
Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b show n and k as a function of the 
photon energy (1.5 s hv s 4.5 eV> for the same films 
whose IR-spectra are depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 3a shows that 
the N-films have a rather constant n-value around 1.8 for 
the whole photon energy range. In the case of the non-as- 
sisted film (i.e., NA) and Ar-assisted films with low 
reduced energy (i.e., A9) we obtain a similar behavior but 
with a higher n-value between 2 and 2.1. However, the 
dependence of n on the photon energy for Ar+-assisted 
films at high reduced energies (i.e., A6) clearly suggests a 
metallic behavior. The dependence of n and k (h v = 2.3 
eV) on the deposition parameters is depicted in Fig. 4a and 
Fig. 4b, respectively. All the N-films show a refraction 
index between 1.7 and 2, apparently independent on the 
deposition parameters. These values are in good agreement 
with data published in the literature for bulk h-BN [7]. On 
the contrary, the A-films show a rapid increase of the 
refraction index with the reduced energy tending to that of 
pure boron when the energy is above 30 eV/atom. In fact, 
refraction indexes above 2 are related to boron rich films.

Reduced Energy (eV/atom) 
Fig. 4. n (a) and k (b) as a function of the reduced energy 
(eV/atom) for BN, films non-assisted (a), Ar+-assisted (ml, 
N;-assisted (0) and NC-assisted at different substrate tempera- 
tures ( IJ ). 
The behavior of k is clearly complementary to that of II. 
The N-films show very low k-values (- 0.11, whereas 
those assisted with Argon show much higher k-values and 
a significant increase as the reduced energy increases 
above 30 eV/atom. Refraction indexes around 1.85 and 
very low extinction coefficients (i.e., 0.005) can be ob- 
tained for N:-assisted films deposited on a substrate at 
200°C and reduced energies around 40 eV/atom. 
All the data above and the observed differences seem to 
derive from structural and stoichiometric effects. Even 
though the sputtering target was stoichiometric .BN, it is 
shown that Ar+-sputtering causes boron-rich films. In fact, 
when the deposition is assisted with Ar+-ions, the films 
show IR-absorption bands which shift towards lower 
wavenumbers and a refraction index which increases, as 
expected for boron-rich films. On the contrary, assisting 
with nitrogen enables formation of stoichiometric and ni- 
trogen-rich films, with a high transparency. All this has 
been confirmed by quantitative AES analysis, as can be 
seen in Table 1, where the atomic [N]/[B] ratio has been 
included for many films. The analysis was performed in 
terms of a standard stoichiometric h-BN sample. 
Although, in general, the N-films showed the best properties, it is interesting to point out that those samples 
grown under low reduced energy conditions (< 30 
eV/atom) underwent some degradation after several 
months of exposure to the atmosphere of the laboratory. 
The effect consists in a significant intensity decrease of the 
main IR-band associated with the B-N bond-stretching 
and the growth of a new band at 3500 cm-’ associated 
with hydroxide species. On the contrary, those films de- 
posited at higher reduced energies and/or on substrates at 
temperatures 2 100°C did not show any degradation even 
after six months of exposure to the atmosphere. Such 
improvement is generally attributed to a reduction of the 
void density and consequently to a densification of the 
films due to the transfer of momentum to the growing film 
which hinders the adsorption of water and their oxidation. 
4. Conclusions 
Thin BN, films have been prepared on Si(100) in a 
dual-ion-beam sputtering system from a BN target. The 
films have been characterized by ET-IR spectroscopy and 
spectroscopic phase-modulated ellipsometry as a function 
of the deposition and irradiation parameters. It is shown 
that the Ar+-assisted films are boron rich with refraction 
indexes above 2 or even higher as the deposited energy of 
the assisting ions increases. On the contrary, Nc-bombard- 
ment causes the formation of stoichiometric and even 
nitrogen-rich BN films, characterized by refraction indexes 
around 1.85 (hv = 2.3 eV>. Furthermore, the stability of 
the films against air exposure is enhanced when the de- 
posited energy of the Nl-ions is above 30 eV/atom 
and/or the substrate temperature is above 100°C. The 
results are discussed in terms of the stoichiometry (i.e., 
[Nl/[Bl atomic ratio) and the enhanced packing density 
induced by the ion assistance.
