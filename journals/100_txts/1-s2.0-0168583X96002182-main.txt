Abstract 
The elastic scattering cross section for 9Be( cY,rr)‘Be has been measured in a strongly resonant region from 6.00 to 6.50 
MeV at a laboratory angle of 177”. This reaction has been used to investigate Be diffusion in the bulk metallic amorphous 
alloy Zr,,.2Ti,3.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 in the solid state (SS) as well as in the supercooled liquid state (SLS). Above the glass 
transition, i.e., in the SLS, a remarkable increase in the diffusivity of Be (about two orders of magnitude over a 40 K 
temperature interval) was observed, which can be explained with a modified Arrhenius fit, which takes into account the 
change in configurational entropy due to the glass transition. 
1. Introduction 
With their unique mechanical, electrical, magnetic and 
corrosion properties over conventional metals or alloys, 
amorphous metallic alloys have shown a significant poten- 
tial for technological applications in various industries and 
have also provided a strong motivation for studying the 
basic physics involved in these me&table materials frozen 
in their liquid configuration [l]. Among the investigations 
relevant to atomic transport, one of the fundamental and 
interesting questions is: how do diffusion phenomena 
change when an amorphous alloy changes its state from 
the glassy solid state (SS) to the supercooled liquid state 
(SLS)? However, due to the poor thermal stability of 
conventional metallic glasses with respect to crystalliza- 
tion, the diffusion measurements in amorphous alloys have 
had to be restricted to the SS. 
In this paper we show that a newly discovered multi- 
component metallic glass-forming system with stability 
over a large supercooled liquid region [2] has made it 
possible to perform the diffusion measurements in the SLS

chosen Be to consider first as the diffusing component in 
the novel alloy Zr,,,,Ti,,.,Cu,,,,Ni,,Be,,., [2], because it 
is the smallest and possibly the fastest diffusing atom in 
the alloy and because the glass transition temperature, Tg, 
depends only slightly on the Be composition in the region 
of 22.5% Be [3]. On the other hand, due to its small mass 
and low atomic number the regular RBS technique, which 
has been widely used for diffusion research in materials 
science, is not suitable for detecting Be. Proton backscat- 
tering was considered as a possible alternative for its better 
kinetic factor for Be atoms (K = 0.64 near 180”) versus a 
helium beam (K = 0.15 near 180”). MeV protons exhibit 
many strong resonant features in the elastic scattering from 
Be nuclei, which may be useful for enhancing the sensitiv- 
ity for Be detection. But our experiments with 1.7 MeV 
and 1.8 MeV proton beams indicated that the depth resolu- 
tion was not good enough to see the Be signal broadening 
of the diffused sample. Furthermore, there is a competitive 
peak nearby due to the ‘Be(p,d)‘Be reaction, which makes 
it difficult to profile beryllium in this way. The sharp 
resonance near 650 keV in the 9Be(a, n)“C reaction [4,5] 
offers good depth resolution (lo-50 nm) for profiling Be 
in a heavy ma&x, but the relatively low sensitivity has 
limited its use in our case. 
We suspected that using 4He elastic backscattering at 
higher energies in a relatively flat non-Rutherford reso-

nance region should provide compensation for both the 
small K factor and the low sensitivity for 4He on 9Be. 
Preliminary experiments with a helium beam of energy 
above 6 MeV on a 1 km Be film, which was coated on the 
surface of the alloy as an infinite diffusion source, yielded 
a strong Be backscattering peak with a flat top, and the 
interface region that we were attempting to profile was just 
above the noise of the spectrum. Since data available for 
‘Be(cY,a)‘Be in the range of 1.7-6.2 MeV and 4-20 
MeV [6] are not suitable for specific materials analysis, we 
measured the 4He-9Be elastic scattering cross section at a 
177” lab angle from 6.00 to 6.52 MeV with a thin Be/Au 
bilayer target. The diffusion data in the temperature range 
between 533 K and 663 K taken with 6.5 MeV 4He elastic 
scattering revealed that the glass transition significantly 
influences the temperature dependence of the diffusivity of 
Be m the amorphous alloy Zr4,,z Ti,,.sCu;,.,Ni,,Be,,.~~ 
and a model was proposed to explain the enhancement of 
the Be diffusivity [7]. 
2. Experimental 
The experimental procedures are outlined in Ref. [7]; 
more details about the cross section measurements and 
diffusion data analysis will be given below. Both measure- 
ments were performed in the central chamber of the Cal- 
tech EN tandem accelerator with an ORTEC annular sili- 
con detector at a 177” lab angle; the setup for geometry, 
electronics and energy calibration are the same as before 
181. 
2.1. 4He-9Be cross section 
A self-supporting bilayer film Be/Au was made by 
sputtering Be (about 70 run) onto a 500 nm gold film 
under UHV conditions at the Hahn-Meitner-Institut in 
Berlin. Because the gold film is too thick, it is difficult to 
observe Be signals in RBS with a 4He beam below 1.5 
MeV, where the interaction between 4He and 9Be are still 
Rutherford [9]. The ‘Be(p, p)‘Be resonance at E,, = 2.525 
MeV at lab angle of 142.4” was employed to measure the 
thickness of the Be layer with an ordinary Si detector. The 
enhancement of the elastic scattering cross section at the 
peak is about 40 times higher than the Rutherford value 
[ 10,111. The area1 density of the Be layer can be obtained 
from the backscattering spectrum, assuming the ‘H-Au 
interaction is still pure Coulomb at 2.525 MeV [12]. The 
total uncertainty of the Be area1 density is about +5% 
mainly from cross section data (k 3%) and energy loss. To 
check the thickness of Be an additional measurement of 
the same resonance was also performed at a different 
scattering angle (170.5”) where the cross section enhance- 
ment is up to 60 times Rutherford [9]. The two results 
agreed to within experimental error, and gave a Be area1 
density of (Nt)B, = (8.22 + 0.41) X lOI at./cm’ for the target used to determine the 4He-9Be cross section at 
higher energies. 
The excitation function was taken from 6.00 to 6.52 
MeV with energy steps of 20 to 50 keV. With the known 
thickness of the thin Be layer and the yield in the scatter- 
ing spectrum the 4He-9Be cross section a,,(E) can be 
calculated [ 121: 
(1) 
where A,, is integrated Be peak counts and H(“’ is 
surface height for scattering from the gold film (neglecting 
the energy loss in the thin Be layer); a,,(E) is the 
Rutherford cross section for Au at the same energy E; 5 is 
the energy scale of the spectrum (keV/channel) and [&Ii,” 
is the stopping cross section factor for 4He scattered from 
Au in the Au film. (Nt)ue is the area1 density of the Be 
layer, obtained as described above. 
2.2. Beryllium diffusion measurements 
Diffusion couples of the infinite source type were 
formed by coating a 1 pm thick Be layer onto the amor- 
phous alloys. The surfaces of bulk Zr,,.,Ti 13.2Cu,2.5Ni10- 
Be 22.5 samples with a diameter 5 mm and thickness of 1 
mm were polished mechanically and electrochemically. 
The surface roughness, as shown by atomic force mi- 
croscopy and Norma&i interferometry, was ultimately 
less than 10 nm (RMS). To eliminate any possible diffu- 
sion barrier on the surface of the sample and prevent 
re-oxidation of the sample surface and interface, the pro- 
cess for sputter cleaning the sample surface and sputtering 
Be onto the surface were all performed under UHV condi- 
tions. Each sample was cut into two pieces, one of them 
was treated for different times at the same temperature, the 
other served as a reference sample. The annealing was 
performed in a differential scanning calorimeter or a rapid 
thermal annealing furnace (for short time treatments, at a 
higher temperature). After the heat treatment the amor- 
phous structure of the alloys was checked with X-ray 
diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy. 
To profile the Be concentration the 6.5 Mev 4He2+ 
elastic backscattering measurements were carried out with 
the same detection setup as in the 4He-9Be cross section 
measurements; the typical beam density was 10 nA/mm*. 
For data analysis, the low-energy electronic noise of the 
spectra and the contribution of the Zr,,,,Ti ,s,sC~~~,~Ni~~- 
Be 22,5 bulk to the signal were removed by subtracting a 
spectrum of a bare Zr,,,2Ti,,sCu,,,,Ni ,J3e22.s sample 
without the Be layer. Signal broadening from the interface 
due to finite energy resolution of the detector, electronic 
noise, interface roughness, and energy straggling were 
determined for each heat-treated sample by measuring a 
corresponding reference sample to normalize the back- 
ground and subtract the contributions from effects other

than the real Be diffusion. The diffusivities were calculated 
from the low energy tail of the Be backscattering signals 
coming from regions with a Be content near 22.5 at%. By 
fitting the concentration profile of the infinite source type

to the low energy tail of the Be signal and considering the 
experimentally determined signal broadening (see below), 
the diffusivity D,, can be determined. In this expression, 
erfc is the complementary error function, x0 is the location 
of the interface, and t is the duration of heat treatment at 
the particular temperature.. A Matano analysis [13] of the 
diffusion profiles reveals the same concentration indepen- 
dent diffusivity for Be contents less than 40 at% and thus 
justifies performance of this simple analysis. 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 1 shows a typical 2.525 MeV proton backscatter- 
ing spectrum from the Be/Au bilayer at a lab angle 142.4” 
with an ordinary silicon surface barrier detector. Both Be 
and Au exhibit isolated peaks well separated from the 
peaks corresponding to elastic scattering from ‘*C and I60 
on the surface and interface and from the peaks produced 
in the ‘Be(p, d)*Be and ‘Be(p, cu16Li reactions. A similar 
backscattering spectrum of isolated peaks for both Be and 
Au was also obtained as shown in Fig. 2 for 6.36 MeV

1O-‘9 ma/s (dashed line). enhanced elastic scattering peaks produced by surface ‘*C 
and I60 are also seen in the spectrum and they are more 
pronounced for the heat treated samples. After removal of 
electronic noise contributions to the measured spectrum 
(which affect the low energy part near the Be signal), 
computer simulation can fit the spectrum well using the 
RUMP [14] code with the measured cross section data for 
4He on 9Be discussed above. The leading edge of the Be 
peak shows a slightly lower surface height (about 5%) than 
the height in the simulation. This is presumably caused by 
surface oxidation of the Be layer but does not affect the 
analysis of the interface region. For the computer simula- 
tion we had to use Ti(4He, 4He)Ti cross section data in the 
vicinity of 6.5 MeV that was lower than the Rutherford 
value by about 10% [1.5]. 
In Fig. 5 (which is not an enlarged part of Fig. 4) only 
the interface regions of the spectra from a reference and 
the corresponding diffused sample are shown. Fig. Sa is 
the backscattering data of a reference sample as prepared. 
In order to quantify the signal broadening effects, the 
concentration versus backscattering energy function of this 
non-diffused sample was assumed to be step-like and 
weight-averaged with a Gaussian broadening function, 
i?(E) = &&enp - (_ y-J0)1) 
with the Be concentration evaluated at E, and the average 
computed over a sufficiently large range of energy E. This 
expression was fitted to the data, with the standard devia- 
tion cr as a fitting parameter. As demonstrated by the solid 
line in Fig. 5a, all signal broadening effects can be taken 
into account by (T= 18 keV. Fig. 5b gives the interface 
data from a diffusion sample corresponding to (a) after a 
135 min heat treatment at 628 K. The Be concentration 
profile can be fitted well for low Be content, assuming the 
above signal broadening and D,, = 1.5 X lo-l9 m*/s. 
However, as can be seen in Fig. 5b, the fitting shows some 
deviation for high Be content, presumably this is due to a 
concentration-dependent diffusivity. An Arrhenius plot of 
the D,, data in the temperature region from 533 to 663 K 
is given in Fig. 6; diffusion data above 663 K were not 
accessible due to crystallization. The data can apparently 
be divided into two subsets, both fitted with Arrhenius 
laws D&‘) = Do exp(- Q/kaT). The first subset for 
temperature from 533 to 613 K with D, = 1.8 X lo-” 
m2/s and Q = 1.05 eV atom- ‘. The second subset for 
temperature from 623 to 663 K shows remarkably different 
values, Do = 1.1 X lO+ r7 m*/s and Q = 4.41 eV atom-‘. 
The cross point of the two subsets is located just at the 
temperature that corresponds to the glass transition of the 
alloy. As the data indicate, in the supercooled liquid state 
of Zr,,.2Tii&uiz.sNi loBe22.5 the pre-exponential factor 
Do increases over 28 orders of magnitude, and the Q 
value is unreasonably high - if one interprets the data in 
terms of Arrhenius behavior. A model which takes into

account the change in configuration entropy due to the 
glass transition yields a modified Arrhenius law [7]:

where Dps is the pre-exponential factor combining all 
temperature independent quantities, AHsLs is the migra- 
tion enthalpy in the SLS, AssLs(T) is the communal 
entropy per atom of the SLS, and N is the number of 
nearest and possibly next-nearest neighbor atoms that can 
influence the diffusing atom. By fitting the experimental 
diffusion data for D,, in the SLS using the above equation 
one obtains values of DiLs = 1.4 X lo-” m’/s, N = 22 
and A HiLs = 1.020 eV atom- ’ for the three fitting pa- 
rameters. Both Dps and AHE’ are almost identical to 
those found for the Arrhenius law below Ta in the SS. The 
results suggest that the enhanced temperature dependence 
of the diffusivity of Be above Ts in the new alloy is not in 
fact due to a higher activation energy, but rather to the 
increasing contribution of the liquid communal entropy 
with temperature in the SLS. Interesting subjects to further 
study are: (1) Whether these features are generally valid 
for diffusion in the SLS of other amorphous metallic 
systems; and (2) the comparison of the proposed model 
with diffusivity measurements at still higher temperatures 
in the SLS. 
4. Summary 
The 4He-9Be elastic scattering cross section at a lab 
angle of 177” in the energy region 6.00 to 6.52 MeV has 
been measured with a total uncertainty of +6%. This 
broad range of enhanced 9Be((Y, a)‘Be cross section, 
about 40 times higher than the Rutherford, has been suc- cessfully used to profile beryllium diffusion in the super- 
cooled liquid state of the bulk amorphous metallic alloy 
Zr,,.,Ti13.sCu12.5N110Be22.5. A remarkable increase in the 
temperature dependence of the Be self diffusivity in the 
SLS was revealed. Beryllium, one of the lightest metal 
elements, is playing an increasingly important role in many 
fields. Thus, this strongly resonant region will be quite 
useful for probing Be in the presence of a heavy substrate 
with reasonable depth resolution (- 100 ;i>.
