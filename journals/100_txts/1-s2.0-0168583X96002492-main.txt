Abstract 
Thin films of YBa&usO,_, (YBCO) deposited by hollow cathode discharge sputtering on (100) MgO, (100) SrTiO, 
and (100) Zr(Y)O, (YSZ) buffered r-plane sapphire, are studied using channeling techniques. Simultaneous Rutherford 
backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) are applied to investigate the high-T, 
superconducting films (HTSC) and the pure substrates. Using the RBS signal of Ba near the surface, we obtain minimum 
yields of 3.2%, 17% and 18% for films on MgO, SrTiO, and Zt(Y)O, substrates respectively. The minimum yields 
measured on thin films with PIXE depend on the film thickness, since X-rays from the total depth of the film are integrated. 
For the films investigated, minimum yields in the range 12-40% are measured when Ba,, Y,, Y,, and CuKa X-rays are 
detected. A constant half-angle for (100) axial scans was found for RBS and PIXE measurements on all YBCO samples 
when signals from Ba, Y and Cu were used. Results on the homogeneity of a large area deposition (50 X 50 mm*) are 
presented. The present channeling results are compared with T,, and j, measurements. 
1. Introduction 
The application of high-temperature superconductor 
(HTSC) thin films in cryoelectronic and high-frequency 
device fabrication requires deposition techniques which are 
capable of producing high-quality large-area HTSC films. 
Sputtering is considered to be one of the most advanta- 
geous techniques for thin-film production currently used. 
To optimize the deposition parameters for the deposition, 
analysis techniques have to be applied, that are sensitive to 
the stoichiometric composition and to the crystalline struc- 
ture. The analysis should also be fast and nondestructive. 
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and particle 
induced X-ray emission (PIXE) are well-known techniques 
that fulfil these requirements for the analysis of thin films 
and near-surface regions [ 1,2]. The combination of RBS 
and PIXE with channeling is a powerful tool for investigat- 
ing single crystal structures [3]. Numerous applications of 
RBS channeling for characterizing HTSC films have been 
published in recent years [4-71, but very few results of 
investigations have been published where PIXE has been 
used [8]. This is probably due to the fact that PIXE 
channeling measurements are hampered by the poor depth 
resolution of PIXE. If, however, the films to be investi-

detected is small, as in the case of high-2 material, PIXE 
channeling can contribute valuable information in addition 
to RBS. In particular when structures of several layers on 
top of each other have to be investigated, PIXE can 
supplement RBS. It is the aim of this paper to show 
examples where the combination of RBS and PIXE chan- 
neling measurements contribute to the characterization of 
YBCO films and layered structures containing YBCO that 
are of interest in the production of cryoelectronic devices. 
We have focussed on samples with thicknesses greater 
than 100 nm where the signals from Ba, Y and Cu overlap 
in the RBS spectrum, making the RBS analysis less accu- 
rate. The case of large-area thin-film deposition for mi- 
crowave applications, with a film thickness in the range of 
250 up to 600 nm is of particular interest. 
2. Experiment 
The RBS and PIXE channeling measurements were 
performed on the 2.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at the 
Hahn-Meitner Institut, Berlin. A 2 MeV He+ beam was 
used to obtain the results presented here. A vacuum of 
5 X lo-* mbar was maintained in the spectroscopy cham- 
ber during the measurement. The samples were mounted 
on a 3-axis goniometer head with an angular resolution of

0.01” which can also be shifted in two directions perpen- 
dicular to the beam. A passivated implanted planar silicon 
(PIPS) detector, with an energy resolution of 17 keV 
positioned at an angle of 150” to the incident beam direc- 
tion, was used for the RBS measurements. The X-rays 
were measured with a lithium-drifted silicon detector with 
an energy resolution of 170 eV positioned at an angle of 
150” on the other side. The distance between the detectors 
and the sample can be varied to adjust them to the count 
rates when scattered ions and X-rays are simultaneously 
detected. The ion current, typically in the range of 1 to 2 
nA, was measured with an annular Faraday cup, which was frequently calibrated by using a second Faraday cup 
that can be moved into the beam in front of the goniome- 
ter. We observed changes in the minimum yields of YBCO 
films after irradiation with a fluence greater 10 p.C in a 
random direction. To avoid irradiation damage, the total 
fluence for measurements on one spot of the sample was 
therefore kept below 2 pC. (100) axial angular scans 
were performed in a plane which was inclined at 22.5” to 
the ( 100) plane. 
The random spectra measured by RBS were quantita- 
tively analyzed by fitting them with computer simulation 
curves produced by the RUMP program (version 3.5 11) [9]

using the tabulated stopping cross-sections of Ziegler et al. 
[lo] with the corrections of Borgesen [l l] and with an 
empirical correction factor of 0.85 for the average stopping 
cross-section in YBCO. Details of the RBS analysis and 
this correction factor are given in Ref. [12]. No attempt 
was made to deduce absolute values of the thickness and 
the stoichiometric composition from the PIXE spectra, 
since the X-ray excitation cross-sections are not suffi- 
ciently well known for accuracies better than 5- 10% to be 
achieved. However, relative intensities of the X-ray lines 
were obtained with an accuracy better than 2%. 
The YBCO thin films investigated in this work were 
fabricated by hollow cathode discharge sputtering. For the 
sputtering we developed a special type of linear hollow 
cathode sputtering gun with a cathode slot 100 mm in 
length and 20 mm in width. This source is capable of 
depositing large-area substrates up to 3 inches in diameter 
by moving the substrate perpendicularly to the cathode slot 
during deposition [ 131. Epitaxial YBCO thin films with the 
c-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface were de- 
posited on (100) MgO substrates of 10 X 10 and 50 X 50 
mm2, (100) SrTiO, substrates of 10 X 10 mm2 and r-plane 
sapphire substrates buffered by (001) YSZ layers. The 
oxygen content of our YBCO films was determined using 
near-infrared excited Fourier-transform Raman spectrome- 
try (FIR) with an accuracy better than 1% [14], since the 
oxygen determination is not very accurate with RBS and 
impossible with PIXE. 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. I shows typical RBS and PIXE spectra of a 300 
nm YBCO layer on MgO. For a film of this thickness the 
RBS signals from Ba, Y and Cu overlap in such a way that 
minimum yields and half-angles of the Y and Cu compo- 
nent cannot be accurately determined with RBS. However, 
the X-ray lines of the three elements are well separated. 
The X-ray spectrum also shows small extra lines corre- 
sponding to Cl,, and InLa. As these lines were observed 
only with samples on MgO substrates and also in measure- 
ments of the MgO substrate alone, it would appear that the 
Cl and In impurities stem from the MgO substrate and are 
not introduced by the preparation process of the YBCO 
films. This is confirmed by XPS measurements where 
these species were not found at the surface of the YBCO 
films. 
In Table 1 the minimum yields xmin and full-width 
axial half-angles for 2 MeV He” channeling are presented. 
‘RBS (element) ss’ and ‘si’ stands for sub-surface and 
sub-interface. In these cases only the ions backscattered 
from a 50 nm thick layer below the surface or interface are 
taken into account. ‘RBS total’ means that the backscatter- 
ing of the whole film is considered for the signal, includ- 
ing the surface peak. The relative precision of the xmin 
measurements is better than 5% in all cases except for those measurements where Y,, and BaL, lines are used, 
due to poor counting statistics. The accuracy of the half- 
angles is 0.05” throughout. The results on the substrates 
show the high quality of the pure bulk crystals. The 
differences between the RBS and the PIXE results are due 
to the difference in the sampling depths of the PIXE 
measurements. On bulk samples this depth depends on the 
energy loss of the ions and on the X-ray absorption in the 
sample, and is therefore larger for Al,O, and MgO than 
for SrTiO,. 
Looking at the results for the YBCO films, within the 
experimental error, we observe the same axial half-angles 
for all samples when the signals from Y, Ba and Cu are 
used. Yu et al. [ 151 have carried out computer simulations 
for 1.5 MeV He+ channeling in YBCO, i.e. with an ion 
energy which is lower than the energy in the present 
experiment. They have obtained an identical angular half- 
width from Y and Ba in good agreement with our experi- 
mental findings, bearing in mind that the half angles 
decrease with increasing energy. The computer simulations 
result in a slightly smaller half-width from Cu compared to 
the half-width from Y and Ba and this can be explained by 
the structure of the YBCO unit cell. We do not observe a 
different half-width for Cu. but a difference at the higher 
energy of our experiment could be too small to be detected 
with the accuracy of the present experiment. 
For the 70 nm YBCO film on MgO, where the RBS 
signals of the Ba, Y and Cu components are well sepa- 
rated, we find good agreement between X-ray and RBS 
total-minimum yields for all three components. Thus the 
minimum yield results for RBS and PIXE are the same 
provided the same sampling depth of the signal is used. To 
demonstrate this point, the results of this sample were 
included although it is an example from the early stages of 
our preparation development with rather poor crystal qual- 
ity. An angular scan has been performed with this sample 
only for the Ba component. No significant difference 
between RBS and PIXE axial half-angles is observed in 
this case. 
For each YBCO sample the minimum yields of Ba and 
Y signals are almost the same and the minimum yield of 
the Cu signal is about 10% higher than that of the Ba or Y 
signal. Yu et al. [15] give no values for minimum yields 
but with a small decrease in the half-angle for Cu. a small 
increase in minimum yield is also expected. It is not clear 
at present if the higher xmin values for Cu can be ex- 
plained by the intrinsic difference in channeling along two 
different atom rows in a perfect crystal, or if it is an 
indication of a slightly higher disorder in the Cu sublattice. 
The minimum yield for the various YBCO samples varies 
over a wide range. Changes in minimum yield with con- 
stant angular half-width is compatible with randomly dis- 
tributed disorder. More detailed information on the kind of 
disorder could possibly be gained by additional experi- 
ments in different crystal directions combined with simula- 
tion calculations.

SrTiO, /I70 nm YBCO/MgO. 
For the sample with a SrTiO, layer on top, the X-ray 
minimum yields of the YBCO layer underneath cannot be 
compared with the RBS total minimum yield, since the 
RBS signals from the two layers are not separated. This 
layer structure is of great interest as a first step towards the 
preparation of two electrically isolated high-l”, films on 
one substrate. A SrTiO, layer of high single-crystal quality 
is a prerequisite for a good epitaxial growth of the second 
YBCO layer. Fig. 2 shows angular scans around the ( 100) 
axis for this sample using various signals. Y, and Ba,,,,@ 
X-rays interfere with Sr, and Ti,,,x, X-rays respectively, 
and the backscattering signals of Ti and Cu partially 
overlap. Hence only the PIXE measurement with Sr,, 
X-rays reveals the rather poor quality ( x,,~, = 0.6) of the 
SrTiO, film. The RBS spectrum of this sample shows a 
distinct peak, almost like a surface peak, due to He ions 
being scattered by Ba atoms at the interface of the two 
layers. The height of this peak is about one third of the

height of the Ba surface peak depicted in Fig. la for the 
best YBCO film on MgO. This is an indication of consid- 
erable disorder at the YBCO/SrTiO, interface. This disor- 
der can be caused by bad epitaxial growth of the SrTiO, 
layer on the YBCO or by poor quality of the YBCO on the 
MgO. Experiments are planned to distinguish between 
these cases. 
On a sample of 300 nm YBCO on MgO we measured 
the lowest minimum yields. The value of 3.2% for the 
sub-surface RBS-Ba signal is amongst the lowest reported 
in the literature. This sample is one part of an YBCO 
deposition on a large 50 X 50 mm2 MgO substrate, which 
was subsequently cut in smaller pieces. This large area 
deposition was investigated in more detail since it showed 
some inhomogeneity in the superconducting properties. In 
Fig. 3 the variation of minimum yield for the sub-surface 
RBS-Ba signal over parts of the sample is shown. Each 
point is a measurement with an ion beam 1 mm in 
diameter. The trend to higher minimum yields towards the 
comers of the sample is clearly visible. In Table 2 these 
minimum yields are compared with the superconducting 
properties for different regions of the sample. It should be

noted that the superconducting parameters are obtained by 
a nondestructive inductive measurement using detection 
coils 8 mm in diameter located in the center of the pieces, 
as indicated by the circles. With decreasing minimum 
yield, there is an increase in the transition temperature T, 
and the current density j, at 77 K. Particularly striking is 
the rapid increase in the temperature width AT of the 
transition with increasing minimum yield. The better the 
single crystallinity of the film, the better the quality of the 
superconducting properties. The thickness and the stoichio- 
metric composition was determined from the random RBS 
spectra using RUMP. For the RUMP analysis of these 
films the errors are 5% for the thickness and 510% for 
the stoichiometric composition [ 121. Within these errors we 
found a 10% reduction in film thickness at the edges of the 
sample, but the stoichiometric composition remained con- 
stant for all measurements on this sample with 
Y : Ba: Cu: 0 ratios of 1 : 1.9: 3 : 7. When the film thick- 
ness varies by only IO%, the small differences in ion 
energy loss and X-ray absorption of the films can be 
neglected, and the relative composition of the components 
Ba, Y and Cu can be obtained from the X-ray intensity 
ratios Ba,/Y, and Ba,/Cu, of the PIXE measurements. 
For the large area deposition, as these ratios are found to 
be constant within an error of less than 2% over the 
sample, we do not think that the inhomogeneities in this 
sample are due to variation in thickness or stoichiometric 
composition of the Ba, Y and Cu components. Near-in- 
frared Fourier transform Raman spectrometry has not pro- 
vided evidence of inhomogeneities in oxygen content. One 
explanation could be that temperature inhomogeneities cap- 
proximately 25 K at the periphery of the 3” area heated to 
980 K during the deposition) lead to less favorable condi- 
tions for good epitaxial growth towards the edges of the 
sample. To guarantee a constant temperature over the 
whole area of the substrate and to maintain it during the 
sputter deposition is quite difficult with radiation heating. 
We have meanwhile improved this equipment and we have 
sputtered films on MgO with transition temperatures 2 87 
K, j, 2 2 X lo6 A/cm’ and a surface resistance of 5.2 
mR at 18 GHz. RBS and PIXE measurements on these 
samples are planned. 
In conclusion, our measurements clearly illustrate that 
PIXE channelling combined with RBS channelling, pro- 
vides valuable additional information on the properties of 
epitaxially grown YBCO films. This is of particular inter- 
est for the thicker films needed in microwave devices. Large-area YBCO films up to 50 X 50 mm2 produced by 
hollow cathode discharge sputtering show constant compo- 
sition ratios for Y, Ba and Cu and only a small variation in 
thickness. However, the crystalline order of the film, and 
thus the quality of the superconducting parameters, de- 
creases at the edges of the films. A further improvement of 
the homogeneity of the deposition conditions, especially 
the control of the substrate temperature, is required.
