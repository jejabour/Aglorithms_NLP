Abstract 
The nuclear reaction ‘rB(p, o)2o has been used for the determination of boron impurities in silicon. a-particles with a 
continuous energy spectrum are produced by the three-body-dynamics of this reaction. Therefore, the differential cross 
section of this reaction has specifically been defined for materials analysis and measured at the three different laboratory 
angles 19 = 108”, 138”, 158”, for incident proton energies between 150 keV and 800 keV. The formalism for concentration 
measurements has been developed for a thin boron layer and for a homogeneous boron distribution in the target. The 
concentration has been compared with results of charged particle activation analysis (CPAA) using the nuclear reaction 
“B(d,n)“C. 
1. Introduction 
Boron is an often used dopant in semiconductors and is 
commonly detected using secondary ion mass spectrome- 
try (SIMS). However, as a second non-destructive nuclear 
technique besides the CPAA [ 11, the nuclear reaction anal- 
ysis (NRA) can be an useful alternative for the detection of 
boron [2]. An extensive overview over existing nuclear 
reactions for boron detection and their applications is 
given by Moncoffre [3]. The advantages of the nuclear 
reaction “B(p, (~120~ for boron detection in materials 
analysis are: (a) it is sensitive to the more abundant boron 
isotope “B (80.2% natural abundance), (b) it has a large 
cross section (300 mb [4]>, and (cl there are almost no 
interfering nuclear reactions (see theory below). Unfortu- 
nately, the differential cross section does not have a sharp 
resonance, which makes detailed depth profiling impossi- 
ble. The energies of the o-ejectiles form a continuum 
extending from 5 keV up to over 5 MeV. Since the 
energies of the backscattered protons also cover this en- 
ergy range, a specific theory is necessary for the evaluation 
of the experimental data. In this paper we discuss an 
example of a homogeneous boron doped silicon sample, 
yhere the advantages of the nuclear reaction “B(p, o)2a 
are utilised for materials analysis. 
21 Theory 
The sensitivity of a nuclear reaction in materials analy- 
sis is mainly limited by the presence of interfering reac-

light element, an incident energy EP < 1 MeV of the 
proton is sufficient to induce a nuclear reaction which 
produces o-particles. In this energy range, only the cr-par- 
titles from the 15N(p, (.u)‘*C and 180(p, a)‘*N reactions 
can interfere [4]. Since the natural abundancies of 15N 
(0.37%) and 180 (0.2%) and cross sections are small 
compared to the boron cross section, interference is not a 
problem if the nitrogen or oxygen concentrations do not 
exceed those of the boron by a factor of lo3 [4]. The 
reaction of a proton with a “B nucleus has four exit 
channels [5].

“B+p-t’*C* +02+03+oq, (III) 
“B+p+‘*C* -,‘*C+y. (IV) 
The reaction exit channel (IV) has a maximum cross 
section of 1.57 pb [3] for EP < 1 MeV and is therefore not 
suitable for trace element detection. However, if a suffi- 
cient amount of boron is present in the sample, the reso- 
nance at EP = 163 keV with a width of r= 5.5 keV can 
be used for depth profiling [6]. 
As a consequence of the three-body-dynamics for the 
reaction exit channels (I), (II), and (III), the energies of the 
ol-ejectiles for a projectile energy below 1 MeV are in a 
continuum [7] extending from 5.5 MeV down to 5 keV. 
The different groups of cr-ejectiles overlap one another in 
the spectrum and are not distinguishable. A spectrum of 
the nuclear reaction “B(p, ~120: (on a thin boron film) is 
shown in Fig. 1. This spectrum has been measured using

an 8 km thick mylarfoil in front of the detector to stop the 
backscattered protons. Only the cx,-ejectiles are clearly 
distinguishable from the rest of the spectrum, whereas the 
other ol-ejectile groups are in the same energy range. 
For light elements an 8 pm thick mylarfoil is sufficient 
to stop the backscattered protons when using the 660 keV 
resonance [4] for materials analysis. Using tabulated stop- 
ping powers (Ziegler et al. [8]) to calculate the energy loss 
in the mylarfoil, and disregarding the first few channels of 
the spectrum because of the background noise of the 
detector (disregard the first 54 keV of the spectrum), only 
cw-ejectiles with an initial energy of more then 2.2 MeV are 
detectable. Consequently, in this paper the cross section of 
the nuclear reaction l’B(p, CX)~LI will always be under- 
stood to include only those a-ejectiles with this minimal 
initial energy. The differential cross section d g/d L?( E, 0) 
for this reaction, can be determined through-measurements 
on a thin target, and is given by [9]:

where 0 is the detection angle, AO is the detector solid 
angle, Q is the total number of incident ions, E is the 
energy of incident particle, E{ is the energy of detected 
particle before the mylarfoil, N(z) is the concentration 
distribution of target nuclei (atoms/cm3), Y(E, E’,, 0) is 
the yield of detected particles with the energy E;, by using 
projectiles of the energy E. 
The cross section (1) varies as a function of the mini- 
mal initial energy of the ejectiles (here 2.2 MeV), which is 
determined by the experimental set-up of the experiment. 
For example, if a thicker mylarfoil is used (i.e. to stop the 
backscattered protons for a high 2 target material), the 
detectable initial energy increases, whereas the cy-ejectile 
yield will be reduced. A higher initial energy of the

ol-ejectile yield is also measured, if boron is not located on 
the sample surface but in the depth of the target, the 
a-particles loose kinetic energy on the way from the depth 
to the sample surface. This minimal initial energy 2.2 
MeV + E can be calculated from the stopping powers [8], 
and the effective cross section can be calculated from the 
surface cross section (I) multiplied by a factor W(E), 
which is defined as the detected yield divided by the 
complete yield (E = 0):

W(E) is calculated from a reference spectrum of a thin 
boron target, in which E = 0. The fraction of detectable 
a-ejectiles W(E) is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of the 
energy E, which exceeds 2.2 MeV. The function W(E) was 
calculated from the data in the spectrum of Fig. 1. 
The large differential cross section of the nuclear reac- 
tion “B(p, 01)2a and the low interference from other 
reactions allows to detect of boron impurities down to 30 
ppb(a) [4]. The reaction kinematics however, causes great 
difficulties in the calculation of the boron concentration 
using the a-yield. Nevertheless, two special cases are 
analytically solvable: (a) the boron is homogeneously dis- 
tributed in a thin layer only, where the projectile energy 
and thus the cross section can be taken as constant over the 
entire depth of the boron layer and (b) the boron is 
homogeneously distributed over the entire depth z,, in 
which the protons have sufficient kinetic energy to cause 
nuclear reactions with the boron.

In the case of a thin layer of boron, the concentration 
can be calculated by rewriting Eq. (1) as 
QARg(E, e)w(c(z))Az 
1 -1 
. (4) 
The thickness A z of the boron layer was used to simplify 
the integral. The modification of the differential cross 
section (i.e. thickness of mylarfoil # 8 pm or the boron is 
in the target depth) is taken into account by the factor 
w[ E( z>l. 
If the boron is homogeneously distributed, o-ejectiles from 
every target layer up to a depth of z,, will be measured 
in the spectrum. If Eq. (1) is integrated over the depth z, 
the effective cross section is used, and N(z) is constant 
(N(z) = N), then Eq. (1) can be transformed to 
-1 
zmaxg(E, O)w[.+z)] dz] . 
(5) 
The double integral in the numerator is a consequence of 
the different spectra which are detected, if the o-particles 
are emitted from different target depth. The value of this 
integral is the total detected yield Y and can therefore be determined by integrating the o-particle yield of the exper- 
imental spectrum.

Since the number of projectiles (protons), ejectiles (a-par- 
ticles), and the detector solid angle are experimentally 
accessible quantities, only the integral in the denominator 
has to be calculated numerically. Consequently a homoge- 
neous boron concentration in a target can be determined 
using the nuclear reaction “B(p, a)2a. 
3. Experimental 
The 2.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the Institut 
fti Kemphysik, University of Frankfurt has been used for 
the experiments. The accuracy of the beam energy is 
determined by the accuracy of the analysing magnet and is 
approximately + 1 keV. The irradiation chamber is electri- 
cally insulated from the ground and the pumps, so that the 
set-up functions as a Faraday-cup. At the entrance of the 
chamber, a 4 mm diaphragm prevents secondary electrons 
from leaving the Faraday-cup. The accuracy of the current 
measurement, including the quality of the current integra- 
tor is about 3%. The o_-ejectiles were detected with a 
surface barrier detector whose solid angle (7.5 msr) is 
determined with an accuracy of about 2%. An 8 km thick 
Mylarfoil is used to stop backscattered protons for an

incident proton energy of up to 500 keV completely. In the 
range of 500 keV to 850 keV a 12 pm thick Mylarfoil is 
necessary to stop the backscattered protons. The resultant 
loss of detectable o-particles is compensated by multiply- 
ing the yield with the factor w[ E(Z)], so that the cross 
section is determined as if the entire proton energy range 
has been measured with an 8 pm thick Mylarfoil. A 120 
keV region between 460 keV and 580 keV has been 
measured with both mylarfoils and the overlapping results 
have been used to compare and test the accuracy of the 
factor w[ t‘( z)]. 
The boron targets are produced by evaporating boron 
onto a tantalum plate with an e-gun and subsequently 
evaporating gold onto the thin boron film. The thickness of 
both films are measured with Rutherford backscattering 
spectrometry (RBS) to determine the shift in the tantalum 
edge with and without the layers [ 11. The pfecision of the 
target thickness is determined by the accuracy of the 
stopping power values (5% [8]). Typical values for the 
target thicknesses are 210 kg/cm’ for the gold and 35 
pg/cm2 for the boron layer [l]. The consequence of the 
depth of the boron layer on the yield, and subsequently on 
the cross section is less then 1%. 
For the measurement of a homogeneous boron concen- 
tration, a silicon wafer with an as-grown boron impurity 
was used. With an incident proton energy of 700 keV, the 
maximum of the cross section (N 300 mb [4]) was used in 
the analysis. The experimental set-up which was used for 
the cross section measurements has also been used for the 
determination of the boron concentration. The detector was 
placed under an angle of 0 = 158” and an 8 pm mylar-foil 
was mounted in front of the detector. 
4. Results and discussion 
The cross section of the nuclear reaction tlB(p, (r)2a 
is determined with an error of 8% (l-3% statistical error 
in the yield, dependent on the yield). The depth of the 
boron layer with the reultant energy loss, the energy 
straggling in the target, and the energy inaccuracy of the 
ion beam limit the accuracy of the reaction energy to f7 
keV. The differential cross section of the nuclear reaction 
‘lB(p, a)2a has been measured for three different labora- 
tory angles, and are shown in Fig. 3 (error bars not shown 
for clarity). The 0= 158” angle is the maximal and the 
6 = 108” the minimal achievable angle with the experimen- 
tal set-up. The resonance at E, = 655 rt 10 keV with the 
width of r= 310 + 10 keV compares well with the litera- 
ture values of ER = 663 keV and r = 300 keV [4,14,15]. 
The resonance at 163 keV is barely detectable, since the 
energy loss of the projectile in the boron layer (12 keV) is 
larger then the resonance width of r = 5.5 keV [ 111. The 
absolute values of the cross sections at 0= 158” agree 
with the measurements of Ligeon et al. [4] (within the 
calculated error margin). Ligeon, however measured the cross section with a detector with a large angular opening 
of = 1 sr (the aperture extending from 8 = 140” to 0 = 
160”) and therefore did not measure the angular depen- 
dence of the cross section. 
The angular dependence of the nuclear reaction “B(p, 
01)2o can be determined by normalising the cross section 
measurements. Hereby the systematical errors are elimi- 
nated, reducing the total error to 2.5%. The angular depen- 
dence is in the order of 12 + 2.5% in the ER = 663 keV 
resonance, agreeing remarkably well with the measure- 
ments of Becker et al. [lo] who estimated 10%. 
The above mentioned silicon wafer target was analysed 
with CPAA, using the nuclear reaction “B(d,n)“C [l]. A 
boron impurity concentration of 100 + 12 ppm(a) [ 121 was 
measured. Using the “B(p, (w)2a cross section and the 
formalism described above, a boron impurity concentration 
of 112 + 20 ppm(a) was found. The results of the two 
techniques are the same. 
5. Conclusions 
The excitation function of the nuclear reaction “B(p, 
cr)2cc has been measured for three different angles in the 
energy range from 150 keV up to 800 keV. The location of 
the resonances, their width and their absolute values agree 
with the literature values. The detailed presentation of the 
large differential cross section enables the application of 
this nuclear reaction for materials analysis, in allowing the 
determination of traces of boron down to 30 ppb(a) of 
atoms in the bulk of matrix materials. A formalism is 
given to enable the calculation of the boron concentration 
from the ejectile yield if the boron is in a thin layer or is 
homogeneously distributed in the target. Because of the 
large number of data points in the cross section measure- 
ments, it is possible to calculate the integral in the concen- 
tration determining equation with high precision. Using the 
nuclear reaction ‘lB(p, o)2cx and the developed formal- 
ism, the same boron concentration has been measured in 
comparison with the CPAA, thereby proving its validity. 
Despite of its less favourite depth resolution the nuclear 
reaction “B(p, o)2cx is an attractive alternative to boron 
impurity detection with the CPAA method if the boron is 
known to be distributed homogeneously throughout the 
target.
