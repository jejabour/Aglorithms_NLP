Abstract 
The configuration of a PIB source was studied to grow uniform large-area HTS (high-temperature superconducting) films 
for application to coil or tape fabrication. The uniformity of thin films was simulated in cases where a PIB source was placed 
with tilted (0) and off-axis (L) orientation on the assumption that the thickness distribution of PIB deposited films followed 
the (cos my)” law. The tilted and off-axis orientation was found to improve the uniformity of the thin films. The calculated 
uniformity at D = 430, 0 = 30” and L = 30 was greater than 90%, where D was the source-substrate distance. Fabrication 
of HTS films at D = 430 reduced the source consumption and prolonged the source life significantly. As-deposited films 
prepared on a 6 in. rotating sample holder at D = 430 have a composition variation of no more than + 5% and a zero 
resistance temperature of 78-80 K.

We have investigated high-temperature superconduct- 
ing (HTS) films prepared by partially ionized beam (PIB) 
deposition in order to apply these films to tape or coil 
fabrication. ErBa,Cu,O,_, films have already been pro- 
duced on a sample holder 3 in. in diameter from three PIB 
sources for Er, Ba and Cu deposition [l-3]. However, film 
fabrication on a larger diameter (e.g. 6 in.) substrate is 
necessary for our purposes. Formation on a larger substrate 
can basically be performed by increasing the distance 
between the PIB sources and the substrate. However, 
because the films are produced at a relatively high pressure 
(l-4 x 10m4 Torr), the collisions which take place be- 
tween gas molecules (0, + 6 vol.% 0,) and metal atoms 
present problems to the fabrication of good HTS thin 
films, as will be explained. The problems are not particular 
to the PIB deposition but common to all physical deposi- 
tion methods. Therefore, we needed to focus our studies on 
reducing the collisions previous to fabricating the tapes or 
coils. The results on reducing the collisions by lowering 
the pressure during deposition have already been reported 
[4]. This paper presents the effects of tilted and off-axis 
orientation of PIB sources on improving the deposition 
efficiency and the film thickness distribution.

studied by evaluating the distributions of SIO, films pro- 
duced with reactive PIB deposition at an oxygen pressure 
of 3 X lo-’ Torr [5,6]. The data were very close to a 
(cos (Y)* at l/d = 0.5 and tended to show a center-con- 
centrated distribution as I/d increased, where (Y was the 
ejection angle from the source nozzle, 1 a nozzle length of 
1 mm, and d nozzle diameters of 1 and 2 mm. Taking 
those data into consideration, we assume that the distribu- 
tion of PIB deposited films is simply proportional to 
(cos cr)“, where n is an experimental constant and not 
more than 11 within our experiments. In the following 
simulations, we used 11 as n to calculate the lowest 
uniformity. The configuration of the PIB source and the 
substrate is illustrated in Fig. 1. The deposition efficiency 
is defined as the ratio of the metal quantity utilized for the 
film formation on a substrate of 150 mm diameter to that 
evaporated from the source and is obtained by calculating 
the following integral, 
// (cos cy)“sin /? sin y 0’

The uniformity of the film thickness is defined as 
T(min)/T(max), where r(min> and T(max) are the mini- 
mum and maximum thickness within the radial distance of 
75 mm, respectively. The substrate is assumed to rotate at

3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 2 shows the calculated uniformity of the film 
thickness and the deposition efficiency as a function of D, 
the distance from the source to the substrate. The uniform- 
ity increased with an increase in D. In contrast to this, the 
deposition efficiency decreased with D. For example, a 
uniformity greater than 90% is obtained at D = 564 mm or 
more, while only ca. 8% of the evaporated metals are 
utilized for film formation. The real deposition efficiency 
(and rate) is greatly lowered by oxygen-metal collisions 
[3]. Therefore, the source temperature must be raised to 
maintain a given film growth rate. If the deposition effi- 
ciency is too low, the source is overheated to such an 
extent that source materials (W or Ta) can not endure the 
corrosion with the deposition metals (Cu, Ba and Er). The 
Ba source became very fragile and some cracks were

found on the Cu and Er sources, when fabrication was 
performed at D = 680 with a film growth rate of 4 
nm/min. In addition, the Ba source used up the metal 
charged in the source (crucible) by depositing 100 nm 
thick films only one or two times. 
Fig. 3 shows the calculated uniformity of film thickness 
in cases where a PIB source is placed with tilted (0) and 
off-axis (L) orientation. The distance D was maintained at 
430 mm. This figure shows that the tilted and off-axis 
orientation is very effective in improving unifirmity. For 
example, the uniformity at D = 430, 0 = 30” and L = 30 
is 9 I % and almost identical to that at D = 564, 0 = 0” and 
L = 0. 
Fig. 4 shows the calculated deposition efficiency as a 
function of 0 and L. The distance D was also maintained 
at 430 mm. Data were normalized by the efficiency at 
D = 430, 0 = 0” and L = 0. Comparing Fig. 4 with Fig. 3, 
we found that while the uniformity increased with the 
tilted and off-axis orientation, the efficienct decreased. 
However the efficiency reduction induced by the tilted and 
off-axis orientation is compensated by the efficiency im- 
provement induced by the decrease of the distance, D. For

example, the efficiency at D = 430, @ = 30” and L = 30 
is 133% of that at D = 564, @ = 0” and L = 0 (configura- 
tion effect). In addition, the efficiency improvement is 
enhanced with the reduction of oxygen-metal collisions. 
The extent of enhancement depends on the elemental 
species. The enhancement for a metal with a smaller mass 
number is larger. We estimated the extent of enhancement 
for barium deposition as an example. The mean free path 
(M) for barium-oxygen collisions is 250 mm at 4 X low4 
Torr and follows the equation 
A’ = N,exp( -D/M), 
where No is the number of metal atoms ejected fromt he 
source and N the number of atoms reaching the substrate 
141. Using this equation, we can estimate the efficiency 
improvement by drcreasing the source-substrate distance 
(distance effect). The efficiency at D = 430 is found to be 
171% of that at D = 564. Combining the efficiency im- 
provement of more than 2 times. 
Fig. 5 shows the calculated profile of a film thickness 
for D = 430, 0 = 30” and L = 30. The film thickness is 
found to decrease with the radial position monotonously. 
The dependence of n on the thickness uniformity for 6 in. 
film fabrication is shown in Fig. 6. Considering the fact 
that n is not more than 11, we can expect uniformity 
greater than 90% at D = 430, @ = 30” and L = 30 with a 
sufficient margin. Evaluation of ErBCO thin films fabri- 
cated at D = 430, 0 = 30” and K = 30 on MgO(100) were 
carried out to confirm these calculations.

Fig. 7 shows the film composition profiles obtained 
over a rotating 6 in. holder. Data were normalized by a 
metal weight detected from a sample 10 X 10 mm) placed 
on the center. The weight of the metal deposited on the 
sample was determined by ICP (inductively coupled 
plasma) measurements of the film. No orderly tendency 
was found in these elemental profiles of Er, Ba and Cu and 
the variation was no more than +5 wt.%. Therefore, 
uniform HTS films of 6 inches in diameter can be ex- 
pected from this configuration. 
The critical temperatures (&I of the films were evalu- 
ated by a standard fourprobe ac measurement. A zero 
resistance temperature of 78-80 K was obtained from 
samples placed on a rotating 6 in. holder. However, T, is 
higher at the outer edge and this variation is caused by a 
temperature gradient in the sample holder [4]. Further steps 
to improve the uniformity of the substrate temperature will 
decrease the variation in T,. The improved properties of 
these films will be published elsewhere. 
Finally, the improvement of deposition efficiency was 
found to elongate the source life and reduce the source 
consumption. No apparent cracks were found on all three 
sources, even after fabricating dozens of films at D = 430. 
The Ba source was capable of depostion 100 nm thick 
films more than 10 times with a batch of barium chunks in 
the source (crucible). 
4. Conclusions 
The configuration of PIB sources was studied from the 
viewpoint of depositing large-area HTS films. Film thick- 
ness was simulated on the assumption that the thickness 
distribution of PIB deposited films followed the (cos a)” 
law. The tilted and off-axis orientation of a PIB source was 
found to improve the film uniformity. The calculated 
uniformity at D = 430, 0 = 30” and L = 30 was almost 
identical to that at D = 564, 0 = 0” and L = 0. Fabrica- 
tion at D = 430 reduced the source consumption and 
prolonged the source life significantly. As-deposted films 
propared on a 6 in. diameter sample holder at D = 430,
