Abstract 
The optical properties of thin films of silicon carbide prepared by the implantation of C,Hz ions into silicon evaporated 
onto a sapphire substrate and subsequently annealed at three different temperatures, 500, 600 and 800°C have been studied 
using spectrophotometry. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant show systematic variations which can be 
attributed to the degree of amorphisation which is in turn related to the annealing temperature. 
1. Introduction 
There exist numerous forms of silicon carbide, crys- 
talline, polycrystalline, amorphous and hydrogenated, all 
of which have current and potential applications, particu- 
larly in the fields of optoelectronics, high power and high 
frequency electronics and environments where thermal sta- 
bility and radiation resistance are important. It is in almost 
exclusive use as the window layer of amorphous silicon 
solar cells and is a good candidate for use in fusion 
devices. Control of the growth conditions allows continu- 
ous variation of stoichiometry, hydrogenation and amor- 
phisation, all of which effect the optical characteristics 
such as optical gap and dielectric function. 
Techniques for the synthesis of silicon carbide include 
rf glow discharge decomposition, reactive sputtering, 
chemical vapour deposition and ion implantation. Compar- 
ison of the results of experiments grown by different 
methods can be very difficult because the results are often 
expressed in terms of machine dependent experimental 
parameters (e.g. silane to methane ratio in glow discharge 
prepared specimens) and interpreted in terms of calcula- 
tions with which the measurements are not directly compa- 
rable. Even when the stoichiometry is well known, it is not 
easy to measure or even define such structural characteris- 
tics as amorphousness and clustering in the non-crystalline 
specimens. 
Experimental techniques such as ellipsometty and spec- 
trophotometry can easily be used to measure the visible 
and ultraviolet optical characteristics of silicon carbide and 
the resulting values of dielectric constant and reflectivity 
can be directly compared with modem electronic structure 
calculations. As calculations of these functions require, in 
* Corresponding author. addition to good wavefunctions for the band structures, 
good optical matrix elements, these comparisons are par- 
ticularly sensitive tests of their accuracy. Only compara- 
tively recently have electronic structure calculations been 
extended to the calcualation of optical properties as op- 
posed to band structures and densities of states. Assuming 
constant optica matrix elements, the joint density of states 
can be qualitatively compared to the imaginary part of the 
dielectric function. Incorporation of these matrix elements 
quantifies this comparison; as yet, however, only direct 
optical transitions have been included. This may help to 
explain the comparative lack of published measurements 
of reflectivity and the dielectric function in the visible and 
ultraviolet despite their fundamental importance and the 
overall size of the silicon carbide literature. 
Thirty years ago, Wheeler published the first reflectiv- 
ity results on cubic silicon carbide [l] which were repeated 
shortly afterwards by Belle et al. [2] and latterly by 
Lambrecht et al. [3,4] who also measured the reflectivity of 
2H, 4H and 6H single crystals. Bartning [s] obtained the 
real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of cubic 
and hexagonal samples from transmission electron energy 
loss measurements and Gavrilenko et al. have measured 
the elecroreflectance spectrum of cubic [6] and also of 4H 
and 6H samples [7]. Logothetidis et al. [8] have applied 
ellipsometry to cubic crystals. The only studies of the 
optical constants of amorphous silicon carbide have been 
carried out by Mui et al. [9] who studied the optical gap 
and real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of 
amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide prepared by rf 
glow discharge decomposition, Akimoto et al. [lo] who 
measured the optical gap and complex refractive index of, 
nominally, the same material prepared by tetrode rf sput- 
tering and Kalomiros et al. [ 1 l] who studied the variation 
of the dielectric function and optical gap as a function of 
hydrogenation and substrate temperature during growth.

Of those who have calculated the electronic structure of 
silicon carbide, only Hemstreet and Fong [12,13], Herman 
et al. [14], Lubinsky et al. {lS], Gavrilenko et al. 173 and 
Lambrecht et al. [3,4] have gone on to calculate any optical 
properties. They have all presented reflectivity and or 
dielectric constant data for cubic silicon carbide. Lam- 
brecht et al. [3,4] have also calculated the reflectivity of 
2H, 4H, 6H, and 15R crystals. The optical properties of 
amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide have been calcu- 
lated by Mui and Smith [ 161 who used a tetrahedron model 
to evaluate the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric 
function as a function of composition and for different 
types of chemical order. Their model is, in principle, 
applicable to hydrogen free silicon carbide. 
In this work, we present experimental reflectivity data 
for three stoichiometric amorphous silicon carbide thin 
films synthesized by ion implantation and subsequently 
annealed at three different temperatures. The reflectivity 
data yield the dielectric function which is qualitatively 
compared to existing optical data and interpreted in terms 
of various kinds of disorder/amorphousness. 
2. Experimental 
Samples were grown by the implantation of 100 keV 
C,Hz ions into a 100 nm thick crystalline silicon film 
evaporated onto an optically transparent sapphire substrate 
at fluences of 1.4 X 10” ions/cm2. The samples were 
then annealed at three different temperatures, SOOT, 600°C 
and 800°C for one hour. After annealing the specimens 
were of stoichiometric composition and hydrogen free; any 
differences in the optical characteristics are therefore re- 
lated to annealing and hence structure alone. Optical mea- 
surements, specular reflectivity, were carried out in the 
photon energy range 1.1 to 6.2 eV using a Perkin-Elmer 
Lambda2 near IR-VIS-UV spectrophotometer 
with a specular reflectance accessory. equipped 
3. Results 
Raw reflectivity data curves are shown in Fig. 1. 
Oscillatory behaviour is observed in all of the spectra due 
to interference as a consequence of the film thickness, 100 
nm, being of the same order of magnitude as the wave- 
length of the probing radiation, 200 to 1100 nm. When this 
is corrected for [17], the reflectivity curves of Fig. 2 are 
obtained. The specimens annealed at SOOT, 600°C and 
800°C show monotonic increases in reflectivity from 0.3, 
0.265 and 0.28 to 0.375, 0.43 and 0.495 respectively as the 
photon energy is increased. Kramers-Kronig transforma- 
tion of this data yields the real and imaginary parts of the 
dielectric constant, e1 and Ed shown in Fig. 3 for all three 
temperatures. At 5OOT, 600°C and 8OO”C, the E? values 090’ ’ . ’ ’ . ’ ’ 1 2 3 4 5 6

and rise to 9.6, 12.2 and 16.8, the latter two having 
maxima of 12.9 at 5.5 eV and 17.8 at 5.75 eV respectively. 
4. Discussion 
Maximum values for the real part of the dielectric 
constant for non-hydrogenated silicon carbide range from 
11.0 for rf sputtered material [l l] to 15.5 for single 
crystals [5]. These values decrease with hydrogenation 
[l 11, a finding consistent with the results of Mui et al. [9]. 
For the imaginary part, maxima of 12.0 and 17.7 are found 
for the samples mentioned. Our values for the sample 
annealed at 800°C of 15.8 and 17.8 for the real and 
imaginary parts are very close to those for single crystals 
[5] and all lie well above the values of Kalamiros et al. [ 1 l] 
who were unable to explain their low values although they 
went to some trouble to take into account the possible 
presence of overlayers and voids. 
Published values for the energy at which the real part 
of the dielectric function is a maximum range from 2.5 eV 
for a-S&,,&,,, prepared by rf sputtering [l 11 to 6 eV for 
cubic Sic [8,5] and 6.5 eV for 6H-SiC [5] for non-hydro- 
genated samples. For hydrogenated samples, this maxi- 
mum increases [ll] consistent with the work on a- 
S&&c.,,. .H films [9]. Corresponding values for the imag- 
inary part of the dielectric function are 5.3 eV [ 111, 7 eV 
[8,5] and 7.7 eV [5], which decrease with hydrogenation 
[ 111. Our values for the dielectric function lie between 
those of the rf sputtered samples and those of single 
crystals, a little closer to the former. They also increase 
with the temperature at which they were annealed. 
Very little data is available concerning the value of the 
optical gap of non-hydrogenated samples and it is not 
profitable to make comparisons with the measurements of 
hydrogenated samples because incorporation of hydrogen 
increases these values abruptly [ 111. For rf sputtered sam- 
ples, the gap has been measured as 0.8 eV [l l] while for 
stoichiometric samples synthesised by ion implantation, it 
has been shown to increase from 1.4 eV as made, to 1.45 
eV after annealing at 800°C for one hour at which temper- 
ature the presence of C=C double bonds is manifested in 
the Raman spectrum, indicting incipient clustering 1181. 
Much larger variations in both the optical gap, which 
increases to 1.8 eV and the C=C Raman spectrum take 
place in the temperature range 800°C to 1000°C in which 
range crystallisation begins. 
It is known from the absence of CH and SiH stretching 
frequencies in the infrared spectra of similarly heat treated 
samples [18] and can be inferred from the high values of 
dielectric constant which are found to decrease with hydro- 
genation [l l] that the samples under consideration are 
essentially hydrogen free. It is also known that annealing 
at temperatures of 800°C or less, as was the case for our 
specimens, fails to induce crystallisation. The shift in the 
maxima of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric 
function towards higher energy on annealing, particularly the real part, therefore seems to be a good index of 
changes in structure taking place at temperatures below 
which large changes in the optical gap and the infrared and 
Raman spectra take place. This is consistent with the fact 
that the lowest published maximum value for dielectric 
constant [ 111 is found for an rf sputtered sample prepared 
at a substrate temperature of 30°C. The absolute value of 
the dielectric function does not seem to be so important as 
disparate values exist for SC-Sic [8,5] and our values are 
very close to those of both 3C-Sic and 6H-SiC as 
measured by Bartning [5]. 
Mui and Smith [9] proposed a tetrahedron model in 
which they showed that the position of the maximum of 
both parts of the dielectric function shift to higher energy 
on going from specimens without to specimens with chem- 
ical order. In this model, ten different possible tetrahedra 
consisting of five carbon and or silicon atoms exist, each 
with its own optical response, scaled from the experimen- 
tal values of a-SiC:H, so the effect of hydrogenation is 
automatically included. The probability of the presence of 
each type of tetrahedron depends on the type of chemical 
ordering and is finite for each tetrahedron in the absence of 
chemical order but favours increasing numbers of Si-C 
bonds as the order increases. For complete chemical order- 
ing, the component which is in excess for a given stoi- 
chiometry completely surrounds the other component while 
it itself can be surrounded by any combination of atoms, in 
the case of homogeneous dispersion, or only by atoms of 
its own type, in the case of phase separation. The weighted 
sums of the optical responses for each of the three cases 
lead to different predictions for the material as a whole. In 
applying the model to a-SiC:H thin films they also took 
into account the possible presence of amporphous graphitic 
and amorphous polymeric (CH,) parts and of voids. For 
stoichiometric compounds, they estimated a low (- 4%) 
graphitic component and as our samples are hydrogen free, 
there is no polymeric part. The total optical response 
would therefore be governed predominantly be tetrahedra 
of various kinds. The transition from disorder to order is 
accompanied by an increased probability of heteronuclear 
Si-C bonds. 
It thus appears, on the basis of this model, that in the 
part of our specimens occupied by tetrahedra, homonuclear 
bonds are being broken and heteronuclear ones created as 
the temperature is increased, although not over a suffi- 
ciently correlated region of space to allow the formation of 
crystallites and thus of a strong transverse optical phonon 
signal in the infrared spectrum [ 181. In the remaining 
space, the formation of C=C double bonds can take place 
as shown by the Raman spectrum of a stoichiometric 
sample annealed to 800°C [ 181. 
5. Conclusions 
The dielectric function of thin films of stoichiometric 
amorphous silicon carbide synthesised by ion implantation 
AD. Laine et al./Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B 116 (1996) 338-341 341 
has been shown to be a good index of chemical order. The 
results are consistent with existing experimental data on 
silicon carbide and with a tetrahedron model for the dielec- 
tric function in this material, and are also compatible with 
the details of the infrared and Raman spectra.
