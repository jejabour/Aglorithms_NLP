Abstract 
The retention of nitrogen atoms implanted into carbon was measured by means of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry 
(RBS). The samples from commercial graphite as well as carbon layers deposited by rf-sputtering in Ar, Ar + N and N 
plasma were used. The results show that, after room temperature nitrogen ion implantation, the maximum N to C ratio in 
graphite layers was about 0.25. However, in the deposited carbon layers after nitrogen implantation this ratio reaches 0.54. 
1. Introduction 
Recent theoretical calculations performed on the prop- 
erties of new materials indicate that P-C jN, carbon nitride 
could be a very interesting compound for numerous appli- 
cations [l-3]. The main interest in the synthesis of this 
material is its theoretical hardness which is expected to be 
higher than that of diamond. Moreover, the combination of 
high electrical resistivity and good thermal conductivity 
recommends this material as the substrate for integrated 
circuits or power devices. 
The growing interest resulted in numerous attempts to 
synthesize carbon nitride, however, until now a continuous 
layer of the proper compound was not obtained. Physical 
vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) methods were mainly used and allowed to synthe- 
size precipitates of B-C,N, in carbon matrix containing 
nitrogen atoms [4]. Recently it has been reported, that thin 
layers containing carbon nitride were formed by laser 
ablation of graphite in the presence of nitrogen [S]. It 
seems however, that ion implantation may be an alternate 
and promising way to synthesize P-C,N, [6,7] since it 
provides usually high impurity concentration and high 
stress level during process which could enhance the forma- 
tion of covalent bonds. Another advantage of the ion 
implantation technique is its ability for easy modification 
of the process parameters such as dose, dose rate, beam 
current and substrate temperature which play an important 
role in the structure of the formed compound. The princi- 
pal aim of this paper is to study the first step in the

determination of the maximum concentration of nitrogen 
atoms implanted into bulk carbon and thin carbon layers. 
2. Experimental 
In the first part of the experiment the commercial 
graphite samples were used. The samples were implanted 
with 260 keV A?+ ions (projected range R, = 210 nm, 
AR, = 40 nm) up to a dose of 1.5 x lOI atoms /cm* and 
subsequently implanted with increasing doses of molecular 
nitrogen. The objective of argon implantation was to incor- 
porate a heavy marker in the carbon layer below the 
nitrogen implanted layer. Basing on the displacement of 
this marker the sputtering coefficient of carbon by nitrogen 
ions can be determined. The nitrogen implantations were 
performed at room temperature with 100 keV N: ions 
(equivalent to 50 keV Nf ions, i.e. R, = 100 nm, AR, = 
22 nm) up to doses varying from 0.5 X IO” to 10 X IO” 
atomsN/cm’. Typical beam current density was about I 
p,A/cm’. During implantation the samples temperature 
was kept below 70°C. All implantations were performed 
using a Balzers h4PB 202RP ion implanter (IEMT War- 
saw). For comparison some nitrogen implantations were 
also performed into carbon layers deposited by rf sputter- 
ing. The carbon layers were deposited on (100) Si sub- 
strates in pure argon plasma, in 50/50 mixture of Ar and 
N and in pure nitrogen plasma. Typical thickness of de- 
posited layers was about 300 nm. The carbon layers were 
then implanted with 100 keV NT ions up to the dose of 
1 X lo”, 3 X IO” and 8 X 10” atomsN/cm2. The con- 
centration of nitrogen atoms in carbon samples was deter- 
mined by means of the RBS with 2 MeV 4He+ beam 
delivered by the LECH Van de Graaff accelerator from 
Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies. The analyzing dose

deconvolution of experimental spectra 181. 
3. Results and discussion 
A typical experimental spectrum recorded for the bulk 
graphite sample pre-implanted with argon and implanted 
with NT ions to a dose of 3 X IO” atomsN/cm’ is 
shown in Fig. 1. Three distinct regions are clearly distin- 
guished: the Ar peak around channel 310, the nitrogen 
peak which begins at channel 170 and the carbon part of 
the spectrum in the channel number region from 0 to 140. 
The case of nitrogen implantation into carbon is one of the 
rare situations where nitrogen atoms are heavier than the 
substrate atoms and can be analyzed directly by the RBS 
method. After implantation most of the samples showed a 
relatively low oxygen concentration, typically l-2 at.%. 
The first part of the experiment was devoted to the 
study of nitrogen retention after implantation into bulk 
carbon samples. The retention dose versus N-ion implanted 
dose plot is shown in Fig. 2. One can note an almost linear 
increase of the retained dose up to about 3 X 10” 
atoms N/cm* when the implantation dose reached 5 X 10” 
atomsN/cm* followed by the saturation at about 3.5 X 
10” atomsN/cm*. The saturation value, as determined by 
RUMP simulations, corresponds to the N/C ratio of about 
0.25. 
The displacement of the Ar marker was analyzed in the 
dose range from 5 X 10” to 10 X lOI atomsN/cm*, i.e. 
in the saturation dose range. The limitation to the satura- 
tion range was due to the fact that for lower doses the 
incorporation of additional nitrogen atoms results in the 
displacement of Ar signal towards the lower energies 
which may compensate the effect of sputtering of carbon 
atoms from the surface. The measured value of the sputter- 
ing coefficient in saturation dose range equals to 0.6. It

should be pointed out, however, that the loss of carbon 
atoms may also be due to mechanisms different from 
collisional sputtering. Some authors [6,7] have suggested 
the possibility of cyanide type chemical bond formation in 
nitrogen implanted carbon. Consequently the loss of car- 
bon may also be due to the volatilization of CN-like 
molecules (chemical sputtering). 
The results obtained for nitrogen implanted graphite 
were compared with those obtained for nitrogen implanted 
carbon films. A typical experimental spectrum obtained for 
thin carbon layers deposited in pure Ar plasma and im- 
planted to a dose of 8 X 10” atomsN/cm* is shown in 
Fig. 3. The comparison with the results measured for bulk 
carbon samples is shown in Fig. 4 which presents the 
highest N/C ratio obtained. It should be pointed out, that 
for films deposited in pure nitrogen the highest N/C ratio 
was not obtained for the highest implantation dose. In fact 
the highest value of 0.54 was obtained after the implanta- 
tion of 1 X 10” atomsN/cm’, the increase of the implan- 
tation dose has resulted in a decrease of the nitrogen 
content to N/C = 0.28 and 0.25 for 3 X 10” and 8 X 10”

atomsN/cm*, respectively. Most likely the accelerated 
loss of nitrogen occurs during ion implantation into the 
films having the composition exceeding N/C = 0.25. Ap- 
parently the N/C ratio of 0.25 corresponds to the most 
stable composition of nitrogen implanted carbon. 
4. Conclusions 
The nitrogen retention in nitrogen implanted carbon 
samples reveal the saturation value corresponding to N/C 
ratio of 0.25, i.e. a value that is much lower than necessary 
for the P-C,N, compound (1.33) formation. The attempts 
to increase this value by the use of carbon films deposited 
in nitrogen containing plasma discharge were only par- 
tially successful. The N/C ratio was increased to 0.54, 
however the structure obtained was highly unstable and its 
decomposition under a nitrogen beam was observed. The 
final N/C value measured for the highest implantation 
dose used was exactly the same as in the case of bulk 
graphite samples or pure carbon thin films deposited in Ar 
plasma i.e. 0.25. The results obtained confirm the hypothe- sis formulated by Konwerska-Hrabowska et al. [9] suggest- 
ing that in most cases the deposition of C-N films by 
CVD, PVD and very likely ion implantation lead not to the 
formation of P-C,N, but to the formation of a new 
compound that could be called polycyanoimine. The hy- 
pothesis is based on the fact, that the infrared absorption 
measurements performed on C-N layers revealed the pres- 
ence of all types carbon-nitrogen bonds i.e. C-N, C = N 
and C = N bonds [9]. From the physical point of view the 
formation of polycyanoimine instead of P-C,N, may re- 
flect the fact, that the lowest free energy of the C-N 
system does not correspond to the carbon nitride. Conse- 
quently, to increase the probability of P-C,N, formation it 
seems interesting to explore the deposition techniques in 
which the new phase is formed far from equilibrium 
conditions.
