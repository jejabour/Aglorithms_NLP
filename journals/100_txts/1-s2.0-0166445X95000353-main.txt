Abstract 
The formation of DNA adducts was evident after treatment of spawned or resting Mediterra- 
nean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk.) with 0.5%100 ,&l of benzo[a]pyrene for 2 and 3 
days. Reference DNA samples, in vitro radiolabelled with 0.5, 5, .50pM 3H-anti (?)-B[a]P-diol- 
epoxide, were initially used to compare two DNA purification procedures. Following a stand- 
ard four-step extraction starting with phenol, in comparison to a simplified single-step extrac- 
tion without phenol, we obtained lower yields of bound radioactivity in the reference DNA 
samples. After simplified DNA purification and nuclease Pl enhanced 3’P-postlabelling assay 
we detected a reproducible dose-dependent increase of a specific spot in gills of mussels treated 
with B[a]P, although this spot was present in low amounts. Short (2 days) and prolonged (27 
days) pretreatment of mussels with a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture, Aroclor 1254, did not 
increase the levels of B[a]P-related adducts. On the whole, these results indicate the formation 
of detectable amounts of DNA reactive intermediates in gills of mussels treated with B[a]P. 
Although the pathway of formation and the molecular identity of the specific adducts remain 
unclear, their presence suggests that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may cause genetic dam- 
age in marine mussels.

1. Introduction 
Sessile filter-feeding invertebrates of the genus Mytilus are easily found in shallow 
littoral and brackish estuarial waters of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. 
Usually, Mytilus spp. live in the intertidal zone and tolerate a wide range of environ- 
mental conditions (Seed, 1976). According to their ability to accumulate pollutants, 
such mussels have often been chosen for monitoring coastal water pollution (Nation- 
al Research Council, 1978; Nasci and Fossato, 1982; Viarengo and Canesi, 1991; 
Porte and Albaiges, 1993). As a matter of fact, the body burden of the chemical 
contaminants and their consequent biological effects may not simply relate to the 
external concentration of such compounds, depending upon physiological processes 
(i.e. metabolism, feeding activity, gametogenesis, etc.) and behavioral reactions (i.e. 
valve closure) of the mussels, as well as seasonal factors (i.e. temperature), and the 
combined action of several pollutants both in the environment and in the organisms. 
For the above reasons, and also for the procedural differences within the published 
studies, literature data on bioaccumulation and metabolism of common pollutants in 
mussels are variable or even questionable (Lee et al., 1972; Kurelec, 1987; Nasci et al., 
1989; Valerio and D’Ambrosio, 1989; Livingstone, 1991; Michel et al., 1994). In 
particular, it is not adequately understood whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAH), well-known pro-mutagens, may cause genetic damage in Mytilus spp. in labo- 
ratory or field conditions, and which molecular mechanism(s) may explain such detri- 
mental effects in these aquatic invertebrates (Kurelec, 1987; Michel et al., 1994). 
Indeed, mixed function oxygenases (MFO) most likely exist in mussels (Livingstone 
and Farrar, 1984; Stegeman, 1985; Michel et al., 1994), and induction of chromoso- 
ma1 aberrations and micronuclei occurred in gill cells of Mytilus galloprovincialis 
(Lmk.) after treatment with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (Al-Sabti and Kurelec, 1985; 
Scarpato et al., 1990). On the other hand, only very weak evidence for DNA adduct 
induction was obtained after in vitro incubation of digestive gland homogenates with 
B[a]P (Kurelec et al., 1988) and after injection of mussels with 3H-B[a]P (Marsh et al., 
1992). In addition, the inability of mussels to metabolize PAH has often been suggest- 
ed (Lee et al., 1972; Dunn and Stich, 1976; Valerio and D’Ambrosio, 1989). 
In order to ascertain the formation of PAH-DNA adducts we carried out treat- 
ments of Mytilus galloprovincialis with the model PAH compound B[a]P. DNA ad- 
ducts were detected in the gill DNA of treated mussels by means of the nuclease 
Pl-enhanced “P-postlabelling assay (Beach and Gupta, 1992; Segerback and 
Vodicka, 1993).

Treutment of mussels 
Mussels of similar size (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk., shell length: 4.7-5.7 cm) 
were collected from a marine farm and a relatively unpolluted site of the Venice 
lagoon (Italy) in autumn 1993 and late spring 1994, respectively. Mussel treatment 
was performed after a few days of maintenance in standard conditions (almost 35%0 
salinity; 19°C and 17718°C in autumn and spring, respectively, no direct light, PAH- 
free commercial balanced mixture, and Clorella sp. as food). Physical and feeding 
conditions were kept constant during experiments and mussel activities (byssal at- 
tachment, valve reaction to stimulation, degree of valve opening and faeces produc- 
tion) were controlled daily. Treatment of autumnal mussels occurred one day after 
spawning from nearly all individuals (handling of ripe mussels was the probable cause 
of spawning). Mussels collected at the beginning of the resting period (late spring) 
were all in a similar physiological state (empty gonads). 
Spawned mussels were treated by adding a solution of B[a]P in dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMSO) to sea water (1 litre per mussel in glass tanks) at the final concentrations of 
0,0.5, 5, 50, and 100 ,ug B[a]P/1(0.005% v/v DMSO), and by performing a semistatic 
test (renewal of water and B[a]P three times a day). Mussels were dissected after 48 
and 72 h of treatment and gill tissue pools (6 individuals per dose point) were immedi- 
ately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. 
In late spring, treatment with 50 and 100 pg B[a]P/l doses was repeated on resting 
mussels as indicated above, except that 5 individuals per dose point were used. Addi- 
tional groups of resting mussels were subjected, just before the exposure to B[a]P. to 
a short (2 days) and a prolonged (27 days) pretreatment with Aroclor 1254, a poly- 
chlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, at the final concentrations of 138.5 ,ug/l and of 
2 and 20 ,@, respectively. Water and PCB mixture were changed twice a day. 
DNA pur$cation from mussel gill 
Frozen tissue (-1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of 1% SDS/l mM EDTA with a 
Polytron homogenizer (8-l 0 s). 
DNA was isolated as suggested by Johns and Paulus-Thomas (1989) with some 
modifications: in particular, a protein digestion step was included because of the 
thready nature of the gills. Homogenate samples (500 ~1) were incubated with 0.1 mg 
RNAse A (30 min at 37°C). Proteins were digested by proteinase K (50 pg) at 45°C 
for 30 min at least. Samples were then adjusted to 1.5% SDS, heated in a 60°C water 
bath (10 min), and 125 ~1 of 5 M sodium perchlorate were immediately added to 
denaturate and precipitate proteins. DNA was extracted once with Sevag (24: 1 chlo- 
122 P. Venier. S. CanovalAquatic Toxicology 34 (1996) 119-133 
roform:isoamyl alcohol, 1 volume) by gently shaking at room temperature 
for 30 min and centrifuging at 16 000 x g, 4°C for 15 min. DNA was precipitated 
from the aqueous phase by addition of 2 volumes of cold 100% ethanol, storage at 
-20°C (nearly 2 h) and centrifugation (16 000 x g, 10 min, 4°C). DNA pellets were 
resuspended in 400 ~1 of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl/l mM EDTA, pH 7.4), precipi- 
tated with 2.5 M sodium acetate pH 7 (0.1 volume) and cold ethanol (2 volumes) and 
finally stored at -20°C. UV quantification of the aqueous DNA samples (in MilliQ 
water) showed 2601280 ratios 2 1.8 and 2601230 ratios between 2.1 and 2.6. 
A set of samples, derived from spawned mussels treated with B[a]P, was extracted 
in parallel as indicated by Gupta (1984). Briefly, homogenates were digested with 
proteinase K and successively extracted with 1 volume each of phenol, 1: 1 mixture of 
phenol/Sevag and Sevag. After resuspension in TE buffer and RNA digestion, DNA 
was extracted once more with Sevag. 
Reference ‘H-BPDE-DNA samples 
Radioactive B[a]P-DNA adducts were obtained in vitro by reaction between DNA 
(0.5 ,ug/,ul), initially purified from control mussels, and different doses (50, 5 and 
0.5 PM) of 3H-anti (t)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,1O-tetrahydro- 
benzo[a]pyrene (3H-BPDE, specific activity 1581.8 ,&i/pmol). Reactions were per- 
formed in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for 3 h at 37°C. Radiolabelled DNA was precipitat- 
ed by addition of 2.5 M sodium acetate pH 7 (0.1 volume) and cold ethanol (2 
volumes) and resuspended in MilliQ water. After 5-7 additional washing steps to 
remove free 3H-BPDE, the aqueous DNA solutions were UV quantified and counted 
by scintillation. 
Four equal amounts of each radiolabelled DNA sample (0.11 ,ug DNA/p1 1 M 
Tris-HCl pH 7.4) were purified by the above indicated procedures (samples extracted 
once with Sevag were indicated with the letter S, and those extracted by using phenol 
and following Gupta (1984) with the letter P). Radioactivity and UV absorbance of 
the recovered DNA were detected to assess the yield of the purification procedures. 
Another reference DNA sample, purified from human lymphocytes treated with 
0.1 pug/ml ‘H-BPDE for 40 min, was obtained in our laboratory, as a kind gift (Prof. 
L. Celotti). 
32P-postlabelling of mussel DNA 
DNA adducts were detected essentially as described by Reddy and Randerath 
(1986). DNA samples (5 pug) were hydrolysed to deoxyribonucleoside 3’-mono- 
phosphates (dNp) by incubation with micrococcal nuclease (0.28 U) and spleen 
phosphodiesterase (0.015 U) in 100 mM sodium succinate, 50 mM calcium chloride, 
pH 6 (3’/, h at 37°C). Normal dNp were dephosphorylated with 1.9 ,ug of nuclease Pl 
in 0.3 mM ZnCl,, 0.25 M sodium acetate pH 5 (30 min at 37°C). The reaction was 
stopped with 2.5 ~1 of 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 9 (final volume: 10 ~1, 0.5 ,ug DNAIpl). 
Adducted dNp, resistant to nuclease Pl, were labelled for 40 min at 37°C with 
[Y-~~P]ATP (specific activity >5000 Ci/mmol). Each digest (5 ,ug DNA) was added 
with 2.5 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 2 ~1 of [Y-~~P]ATP (-20 @i) in buffer mix 
(100 mM bicine pH 9.5, 100 mM MgCl,, 100 mM dithiothreitol and 10 mM spermid- 
P. Venier, S. Canoval Aquatic Toxicology 34 (1996) 119-133 123 
ine). Free [Y-~~P]ATP was hydrolysed with 0.05 U of potato apyrase (40 min at 37” C). 
The molar excess of [Y-~~P]ATP was ascertained by 1-D chromatography (polyeth- 
ylenimine TLC plate in 0.12 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8) of suitable amounts of 
postlabelled reference DNA (see below), before and after apyrase treatment. 
Each 32P-labelled digest (12.5 ~1) was spotted on polyethylenimine TLC plates. 
After overnight development in Dl buffer (1 M sodium phosphate pH 6.8) chroma- 
tography was performed in the first dimension (opposite to Dl) with D2 solvent 
(5.3 M lithium formate, 8.5 M urea, pH 3.5) and in the second dimension with D3 
solvent (1.2 M lithium chloride, 0.5 M Tris-HCl, 8.5 M urea, pH 8). Final TLC 
cleaning was carried out overnight in D4 buffer (1.7 M sodium phosphate pH 6, same 
direction of D3). TLC plates were dipped and gently shaken for 15 min in deionized 
water after each run (Dl-D4). A wick of Whatman paper was stapled to the top of the 
plates for the Dl and D4 development. 
Adduct spots were detected by autoradiography, cut out from TLC plates and 
quantified by Cerenkov counting also applying background correction. 
Adduct levels were calculated as relative adduct labelling (RAL, i.e. number of 
adducts per number of normal nucleotides) according to: 
RAL = cpm in adduct 
S.A. x total dNp 
cpm in adduct = selected TLC area after subtraction of an equivalent blank area; 
S.A. = specific activity (cpm/pmol) calculated by the 32P decay factor and the specific 
activity of [Y-~~P]ATP at the calibration date; 
total dNp = pmoles of dNp spotted on the TLC. 
Reference mussel or human DNA modified in vitro with 3H-BPDE (see the above 
section) was included in each postlabelling assay as positive control. 
3. Results 
Fig. 1 (A and B) shows the mean levels and standard deviations of a specific DNA 
adduct detected by the nuclease Pl enhanced 32P-postlabelling assay in the gill DNA 
(mildly extracted with Sevag) of spawned mussels treated with 0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 100 
pg/l of B[a]P for 48 h (A) and 72 h (B). Despite the low levels of DNA modification 
(at most 0.2 and 0.4 adducts/lOR nucleotides after 48 and 72 h of treatment, respective- 
ly), the two dose-response relationships were statistically significant (Fig. 2). Further- 
more, the comparison (ANOVA) of the adduct levels at each dose point between the 
two treatment times indicated a statistically significant time-dependent increase of 
DNA adducts at 50 ygll as well as at 100 pg/l of B[a]P (P < 0.005, F = 41.67 and 
P < 0.005, F = 48.19, respectively). 
Fig. 3 (a-f) shows typical autoradiograms. The main (spot 1) and a second mobile 
adduct were detected in reference DNA isolated from 3H-BPDE-treated human lym- 
phocytes (3a). In the same zone, no adducts were evident by testing gill DNA of 
mussels treated with DMSO solvent under simplified DNA purification (3b). Follow- 
ing this purification method, a specific adduct (spot 2, along the diagonal zone but

closer to the origin of TLC) was detected in gill of mussels treated with 50 ,ug B[a]P/l 
(3~); however, the same sample did not show any radioactive spot when subjected to 
four-step extraction of DNA in the presence of phenol (3d). Co-chromatography of 
the DNA obtained from mussels treated with 100 ,ug B[a]P/l together with a suitable 
dilution of reference DNA indicated the presence of two adducts, presumably spots 
2 and 1 (3e, 3f, independent runs). The distances of spot 2 and spot I from the origin 
were reproducible over the same batch of TLC plates (about 2.3 and 3.5 cm, respec- 
tively) and co-chromatography images indicated similar relative positions (spot 2/l 
distance ratios were 0.66 and 0.64, the latter obtained by co-chromatography). Some 
faint spots, unrelated to the exposure of mussels to B[a]P, were occasionally present 
in the upper left and lower right corner of the TLC plate (see 3c and 3f, respectively). 
Since procedural differences in DNA purification might explain contrasting con- 
clusions about the presence and levels of PAH-DNA adducts in mussels, we compar- 
ed the efficiency of the simplified purification with Sevag (S) and the four-step purifi- 
cation in the presence of phenol (P) by using radiolabelled DNA. A suitable amount 
of DNA, originally purified from control mussels, was labelled with different concen- 
trations of 3H-BPDE (50, 5 and 0.5 PM). After several washing steps (5-7) to remove 
unbound radioactivity, the DNA samples were quantified by UV absorbance and 
scintillation counting, split in equal amounts and purified by the S and P procedures.

per cent recoveries and the specific activity of such processed DNA samples. The 
sample labelled with 50 PM 3H-BPDE showed an excess of radioactivity (344 779.5 
cpm and 6367.1 cpm/,ug DNA) in comparison to the quite proportional values of 
samples labelled at lower doses (12 022.5 and 1447.4 cpm and 169.3 and 18.8 cpm/,ug 
DNA with 5 and 0.5 PM 3H-BPDE, respectively) thus suggesting a residual presence 
of unbound 3H-BPDE. Percentages of DNA recovery, independently calculated by 
UV absorbance and scintillation counting, always indicated higher yields when the S 
instead of the P extraction procedure was followed. Moreover, the specific activity 
(cpmlpg) calculated at 5 and 0.5 ,uM 3H-BPDE labelling doses for the S procedure 
indicated levels of bound radioactivity higher or comparable to those obtained by the 
P procedure. 
Very similar results were obtained when drastic removal of the non-covalently 
bound 3H-BPDE was performed on formamide-denatured DNA samples by repeti- 
tive extraction with ethyl acetate (data not shown). On the basis of the above consid- 
erations, we purified all mussel DNA samples by means of the S procedure. 
To confirm the relationship between the spot 2 adduct (see Fig. 3) and the B[a]P 
exposure, we treated naturally resting mussels (collected during late spring) with 50 
and 100 ,L@ of B[a]P. Just before the B[a]P treatment, additional groups of mussels 
were pretreated with Aroclor at the doses of 138.5 pg/l for 2 days as well as 2 and 20 
pgll for 27 days. Fig. 4 shows the mean adduct levels (spot 2) detected by two inde-

induction of a specific adduct in mussels treated with B[a]P, the inconsistent effect of 
the Aroclor pretreatment, and also indicated a decrease of the adduct levels in mussels 
pretreated with 20 ,@l Aroclor. 
On the whole, the mean labelling efficiencies, evaluated in each postlabelling assay 
on reference 3H-BPDE-DNA samples (spot l), were 46% and 49% in the case of 
mussel and human lymphocyte DNA, respectively. The molar excess of [Y-~‘P]ATP in 
the labelling mixture was ascertained by one-dimensional chromatography of an ali- 
quot of the postlabelled reference DNA. The coefficient of variation for samples 
tested in the same or different postlabelling assays was generally below 10% or 33%, 
respectively. 
4. Discussion 
Mussels rapidly close the shell if significantly disturbed by any detrimental external 
stimulus such as an acute pollution event; therefore the assessment of the environ- 
mental exposure level based on chemical determinations and biological responses in 
these organisms may be subjected to great variability. However, there is a widespread 
agreement as to the use of marine bivalves, in particular mussels, for monitoring 
marine pollution (Viarengo and Canesi, 1991; Kramer, 1994). 
It is known that mussels accumulate hydrocarbons from the water column into

their tissues, up to lOOO-fold the external concentration, and rapidly eliminate at least 
part of them with a half-life of 2-3 days (Fossato and Canzonier, 1976), although 
half-lives varying from 8 to 16 days were estimated for the model PAH compound 
B[a]P in Mytilus edulis (Livingstone, 1991). In addition to the filtering activity, the 
release of gametes rich in lipidic energetic stores during the spawning period probably 
represents another way of eliminating organic pollutants (Fossato and Canzonier, 
1976; Porte and Albaiges, 1993), a possibility which induced us to avoid the treatment 
of almost ripe mussels. 
Pollution-related DNA adducts have been only occasionally reported in mussels 
environmentally exposed to oil refinery waste-waters (Kurelec and Gupta, 1993). 
Interestingly, low but significant levels of binding (comparable to 0.123-0.165 ad- 
ducts/lo* nucleotides) were detected in mussel digestive gland DNA, 2 or 5 days after 
injection of 12.5 PCi of3H-B[a]P (Marsh et al., 1992). Nevertheless, only a faint spot 
appeared in the lower right part of the chromatogram (butanol-enhanced 32P-postla- 
belling assay) after incubation of digestive gland homogenates with 23 ,uM B[a]P 
(Kurelec et al., 1988). Furthermore, B[a]P DNA adducts were not detected in cuttle 
fish (Sepia ojjicinalis) injected with 200 mg/kg B[a]P and sacrificed 24 h later (DNA 
from gill, hepatopancreas and other tissues was extracted in the presence of phenol 
and tested by the nuclease Pl enhanced 32P-postlabelling assay) (Lee et al., 1994). The 
rapid elimination of B[a]P covalently bound to hepatopancreas DNA in the spiny 
lobster Palinurus argus has been recently reported, and suggests a balance between 
formation and removal of adducts rather than their complete absence in aquatic 
invertebrates (James et al., 1992). In addition, a well balanced phase I and phase II in 
vivo metabolism of xenobiotics could limit the accumulation of B[a]P reactive meta- 
bolites in Myths (Michel et al., 1995). 
Our aim was to determine whether marine bivalves, such as mussels, are able to 
metabolize PAH to DNA reactive intermediates. To this purpose, we chose treatment 
doses (0.5-100 ,@l of B[a]P) which may lead to PAH and B[a]P values effectively 
detected in Mytilus. Essentially, assuming a normal filtering activity, a negligible 
absorption of PAH to the tank and shell surfaces, and a lOOO-fold accumulation 
factor, the above doses of B[a]P would produce tissue concentrations of 0.5-100 ,uglg 
(wet weight). In the Western Mediterranean 0.19 to 5.49 ,ulg (wet weight) of PAH 
were in fact detected (Porte and Albaiges, 1993), while in the Venice lagoon 0.75-2.25 
,uglg of total PAH and 0.02-0.07 ,ug/g of B[a]P (wet weight) were recently found in 
mussel gill tissue (R. Fanelli and E. Benfenati, personal communication).We deter- 
mined the formation of DNA adducts in gill because this tissue is continuously ex- 
posed to xenobiotics on account of the mussel filtering activity, and because it is 
provided with biochemical components for the B[a]P metabolism, although at levels 
lower than those reported for the digestive gland (Livingstone and Farrar, 1984; 
Stegeman, 1985). 
Preliminary experiments, performed on a set of DNA samples derived from B[a]P- 
treated mussels, induced us to isolate gill DNA with a simplified procedure (S, single 
extraction with Sevag, instead of using P, a common four-step extraction with phenol) 
since we were able to detect a B[a]P-related DNA adduct only following mild ex- 
traction conditions. Furthermore, the comparison of the two DNA purification pro- 
130 P. Venier, S. CanovalAquatic Toxicology 34 (1996) 119-133 
cedures, obtained by processing equal amounts of radiolabelled DNA samples (3H- 
BPDE-DNA), clearly showed higher yields of adducted DNA following the S method 
(see Table 1). While the removal of free 3H-BPDE was probably incomplete at the 50 
,uM 3H-BPDE labelling concentration, the range of radioactivity recovered at the 
lower doses indicated in fact higher yields for the S procedure (73.52-89.25 and 
11.92-14.27% for the S and P procedures, respectively). Since at the labelling dose of 
5 ,uM 3H-BPDE the P procedure allowed different recoveries of the UV detectable 
and radioactive DNA (about 20% and 1 l%, respectively), it seems that some BPDE- 
DNA adducts could get lost either during the multiple cycles of extraction or by 
spreading over phenol. When the DNA modification level was sufficiently low (0.5 
,uM 3H-BPDE labelling concentration) a detrimental effect of multiple extractions 
most likely prevailed, since the recoveries calculated by UV absorbance and scintilla- 
tion counting were similar (about 15.1% and 14.3%, respectively). 
The unexpected low yields of radiolabelled DNA obtained by the P purification 
have to be referred to the applied experimental conditions (purification applied on a 
DNA solution in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4). The lower amounts of DNA obtained under 
P purification on tissue homogenates extracted in parallel (data not shown) supported 
the role of sequential cycles of extraction in the aspecific loss of DNA. In agreement 
with our data, some authors showed that phenol-extraction of B[a]P-DNA adducts 
gave a yield of adducted DNA 40-60 times lower than using high molar salt in the 
absence of phenol, and suggested that adducts, inhomogeneous and rather lipophilic, 
may be extracted and lost in the phenol phase (Skaanild and Clausen, 1992). 
Following the mild DNA purification and the postlabelling procedure described in 
Methods, we detected a specific adduct (spot 2) in the gill DNA of spawned mussels 
treated with B[a]P for 48 and 72 h. We did not identify the chemical nature of this 
adduct; however, its position along the diagonal radioactive zone (typical of aromatic 
bulky adducts) and the co-chromatography autoradiograms suggested a difference 
between the adduct formed in vivo in gill DNA and the main adduct obtained from 
mussel or human lymphocyte DNA in vitro modified with 3H-BPDE. 
Despite the low adduct levels we detected (at most 0.2 and 0.4 adducts/108 nucleo- 
tides in mussels treated with 100 @g/l B[a]P for 48 and 72 h, respectively), the dose- 
response relationships and the time dependent increase of the specific adduct were 
statistically significant. 
After the major peak of spawning, broadly occurring from March to April (Fossa- 
to et al., 1979) the treatment of naturally resting mussels with 50 and lOO,~g/l of B[a]P 
still established the appearance of the spot 2 adduct. 
Pretreatment of naturally resting mussels with Aroclor, a mixture of planar and 
bulky PCB expected to induce the MFO system, did not increase the adduct levels, 
irrespective of the exposure to B[a]P. In particular, neither 2-day pretreatment with 
138.5 ,L@ of Aroclor (about 0.35 PM) nor 27-day pretreatment performed at lower 
doses (2 and 20 ,L@) caused any significant increase of the spot 2 (see Figs. 4, 5). On 
the other hand, the highest PCB doses (138.5 and 20 ,&l), followed by treatment with 
100 ,@l of B[a]P for 72 h, substantially lowered the adduct levels (the evidence of a 
toxic effect after prolonged exposure to 20 &l of Aroclor was supported by reduc- 
tion of the macroscopic mussel activities). The apparent non-inducibility of the spot 
P. Venier, S. Canova I Aquatic Toxicology 34 (I 996) 119-133 131 
2 adduct does not agree with the improvement of the in vitro metabolism of B[a]P and 
with the MFO system induction observed following exposure of mussels to 4,5,4’5’- 
tetrachlorobiphenyl for 48 h (Michel et al., 1993) and to Na-phenobarbital for 24 h 
(Galli et al., 1988) respectively. 
Since the detection of such low amounts of radioactivity (spot 2) was dependent on 
the mild conditions used to isolate gill DNA, we suggest that spot 2 may represent an 
unstable DNA adduct. As matter of fact, it has been demonstrated that a consistent 
fraction of B[a]P-DNA adducts (8 1% depurination products and 19% stable adducts 
are formed by in vitro metabolism) is understimated by the standard 32P-postlabelling 
assay (Devanesan et al., 1992; Segerback and Vodicka, 1993). The instability of 1,6-, 
3,6-, 6,12-B[a]P quinones, abundantly produced by in vitro as well as in vivo metabo- 
lism in mussels (55, 65% or 47% of the total B[a]P metabolites, respectively) (Stege- 
man, 1985; Michel et al., 1992,1995), has recently been suggested on the basis of a low 
recovery of radioactive B[a]P quinone-dG adducts in comparison to BPDE-dG ad- 
ducts (Shou et al., 1993). Redox cycling of PAH o-quinones with molecular oxygen 
may result in the production of superoxide anion and semiquinone radicals and, 
consequently, covalent DNA binding, oxidative base damage (e.g. 8-hydroxyguanos- 
ine) and strand scission may occur (Penning, 1993). Interestingly, the appearance of 
low levels of aralkyl-DNA adducts detected under newly developed chromatographic 
conditions in the 32P-postlabelling assay has been recently related to the in vivo for- 
mation of benzylic electrophilic ester of B[a]P (Stansbury et al., 1994). 
Our data indicate the formation of low adduct levels in B[a]P-treated mussels, and 
suggest that PAH intermediates can cause DNA damage in Mytilus. The fate of these 
lesions in mussels is not clear and probably does not simply relate to tumour induc- 
tion (Dunn, 1991); nevertheless, the genotoxic effect of such widespread pollutants in 
aquatic invertebrates may have a great importance at the individual, population and 
ecological levels, according to the definition of ‘genotoxic disease syndrome’ (Kure- 
let, 1993).
