Abstract 
The analytical formulae describing the time evolution as well as the final values of the splat thickness and radius and the 
rates of their variation in the process of flattening of droplets during thermal spraying are obtained. They take into account 
the solidification of the splat and mass loss of an impinging droplet. The theoretical results obtained agree well with the 
experimental data and can be used for the prediction of splat flattening parameters.

1. Introduction 
Flattening of thermally sprayed powder particles 
significantly influences the coating structure and 
quality [l-3]. Usually the characteristic time of flat- 
tening t, during thermal spraying is considered to be 
much smaller than that of splat solidification t, and 
the latter process is neglected when flattening is 
studied [1,2]. In general this is not quite correct. 
Even if t, -=c tc, solidification of the lower part of the 
splat in the vicinity of the substrate-coating interface 
is possible, This process influences markedly the 
kinetics of flattening and the splat form [2,4]. 
The influence of solidification on splat flattening 
becomes more pronounced with increase of splat 
solidification velocity. It occurs when the thermal

thermal resistance at the substrate-coating interface 
decreases [3,5]. Then the spreading and cooling of 
the molten droplet cannot be considered indepen- 
dently [3]. This means that both these processes 
should be taken into account when splat flattening is 
studied. Also droplet mass loss due to splashing and 
the formation of craters in the surface of the imping- 
ing droplet should be accounted for. 
Engineering practice needs rather simple formulae 
which permit one to estimate these processes. Al- 
though these formulae are approximate they should 
reflect all the main features of flattening and make it 
possible to obtain the necessary estimates which do 
not differ markedly from the results of mathematical 
simulation and the experimental data which demand 
essentially more effort to be established. 
This paper is devoted to obtaining such formulae 
which agree well with the experimental data [3,6].

2. Transient characteristics of flattening 
We shall assume that a droplet of radius R, 
impinges normally on to the surface of a smooth 
substrate or previously deposited coating layer and 
forms a cylindrical splat (disc) of radius R and 
thickness b which vary with time during flattening 
(Fig. I>. 
Immediately after a droplet impinges flattening 
and cooling start. The main cooling is caused by heat 
removal from the lower part of the splat due to the 
heat accumulative capacity of the substrate whose 
mass is infinitely greater than that of the splat. This 
heat removal depends significantly on the thermo- 
physical properties of the substrate and splat as well 
as the contact thermal resistance at the splat-sub- 
strate (or previously deposited coating layer) inter- 
face. It considerably exceeds the heat removal from 
the upper surface of the splat [5,7]. 
We shall consider the solidification front moving 
from the mentioned interface with a velocity V, 
inside the splat. The values of V, depend on the 
substrate and splat thermophysical properties, contact 
thermal resistance at the interface as well as the 
initial temperatures of the splat and the substrate. 
These values can be determined based on the meth- 
ods described elsewhere [5,7]. Another possibility is 
to find the velocity V, from Stefan’s “square root 
law” which while giving similar results does not 
reduce the mathematical complexity and is applied 
only in the case of solidification of the pure sub- 
stances [2,8]. 
Droplet impact takes place during the time inter- 
val t, = R,U-‘, where U is the velocity of droplet 
impingement. The characteristic time of solidifica- 
tion of the splat is t, = R,,y,-‘. The ratio p = I, t;’ 
can be written as follows: 
p = v,v-‘. (1) 
During thermal spraying l3 -K I [9]. The flattening

[3,10]. For the flattening process the most important 
aspect is the solidification of the lower part of the 
splat with thickness 6. Then t, = SVym’ and the ratio 
t, t,: ’ has the form 
q= V,R,(US)-‘. (2) 
When 6 = R, from (2) we obtain (I). In the case 
of plasma spraying of a metallic powder on to an 
aluminium alloy or copper substrate when R, = 20 
pm, V, = 5 m SC’, 6- 1 Frn and U= 100 m SC’ 
from (2) we have rl = 1. This means that the solidifi- 
cation of the splat must be taken into account when 
splat flattening is analyzed. 
If during solidification a crystalline structure is 
formed, this process starts when nucleation takes 
place. The ratio N of the nucleation time to the 
impact time for the case of homogeneous nucleation 
was estimated to be rather high for thermal spray 
applications [I 11. But homogeneous nucleation hardly 
ever occurs during thermal spraying due to the pres- 
ence of different inclusions (oxides, carbides, etc.) in 
an impinging droplet as well as due to the possible 
partial solidification of the droplet before impinge- 
ment [12,13]. We assume that the parameter N is 
markedly smaller than unity and delays in nucleation 
practically do not influence the solidification of the 
lower part of the splat during flattening. 
Droplet impingement is often accompanied by 
splashing of the droplet liquid phase [2]. We assume 
that some part of the mass of the impinging droplet 
is lost due to the splashing and also due to the 
formation of craters in the surface where flattening 
occurs 12,141. This loss can be characterized by the 
ratio x of the droplet mass which remains after these 
events to the initial mass of the impinging droplet. 
From the mass conservation condition it follows that 
4R&/3 = R’( b - k’,t). (3) 
For thermal spraying the most interesting case is 
the situation when the Reynolds number Re = 
2 R,lJpkm ’ B 1. Here p and@ are the density and 
dynamic viscosity respectively of the droplet mate- 
rial 
We shall use the dimensionless variables: 
V.V. Soboleu, J.M. Guilemany/Materials Letters 28 (1996) 71-75 73 
Using the method and correlations given in Ref. [6], 
we obtain the following analytical expressions for 5 
and 5 when Re >> 1 and yt -=c 1 (y = t, ’ ): 
ccop’ (1 - wf30), 0 = exp(0.40) (5) 
5 = l.l55x”*W”~( 1 + oswpe) . (6) 
From (5) and (6) we obtain the following rate char- 
acteristics of the flattening process: 
dc/d0 = -0.4w-‘( 1 + 2.5w@), (7) 
dt/d0 = 0.231x”*w”*( 1 + 2.5wl3 + 1.5@3). 
(8) 
From (5)-(8) it is seen that splat solidification causes 
a decrease of the splat thickness, increase of the splat 
radius and its rate of growth as well as an increase of 
the absolute value of the rate of decrease of 5. The 
mass loss leads to the decrease of 5 and de/do. In 
the absence of solidification (l3 = 0) and mass loss 
(x = 1) from (5)-(g) we have the formulae obtained 
in Ref. [6]. At the initial moments of time when 
8 < 1 we obtain from (5)-(g) the following: 
5 = 1 - 0.48( 1 + 2.5p), (9) 
E = l.l55x”2[ 1 + 0.20( 1 + 2.5P)] ) (10) 
dc/d0 = - 0.4( 1 - 0.48 + 2.5p), (11) 
d.$/dO = 0.231~“*[ 1 + 0.20( 1 + 15p) + 2.5p]. 
(12) 
The analytical results obtained are valid up to t < t, 
where [6] 
t, = 1.25R,U-’ ln(1 +0.3Re). (13) 
The value of t. exceeds the characteristic time of 
flattening and the formulae obtained (5)-(g) are 
valid in the whole interval of droplet flattening while 
Eqs. (9)-(12) can be used when t -=z R,U-’ [6]. 
3. Final characteristics of flattening 
Let us find the values of 5, 5, dc/dt3 and dt/d0 
at t=t,. Using (5)-(g) and (13) we have the fol- 
lowing when Re >> 1: 
[ = 1.826Re-‘/2[ 1 - 0.68PRe’/2 ln(0.3Re)], 
( 14) 6 = 0.8546x1/2Re’/4[ 1 + 0.34PRe’/* ln(0.3Re)], 
(15) 
dc/dO = -0.73ReCl/*(1 + 1.37PRe’/*), (16) 
ds/dO = 0.171~1~2Re1~4[1 + 1.3713Re’j2 
+ 1.0313Re1/* ln(0.3Re)l. (17) 
In the absence of splat solidification (p = 0) and 
mass loss (x = I), from (14)-(17) we obtain the 
formulae established in Ref. [6]. Expressions (14)- 
(17) show that solidification causes a decrease of the 
splat thickness, increase of the splat radius as well as 
an increase of the rate parameter dCJdt3 and the 
absolute value of d</d0. The mass loss leads to the 
decrease of 5 and dE/d0. 
From the above analysis it follows that the influ- 
ence of splat solidification on flattening characteris- 
tics is equivalent to the influence of an effective 
velocity U, of droplet impingement. This means that 
the flattening process for a droplet impinging with 
velocity U, , without taking into account splat solidi- 
fication, is the same as when the velocity of the 
droplet impingement is U and splat solidification is 
accounted for. 
Using the analytical expressions (14) and (151, 
this effective velocity, with an accuracy up to the 
terms of the order O(p*), can be represented as 
follows: 
U, = U[ 1 + 0.34PRe’12 ln(0.3Re)14. (18) 
Then expressions (14) and (15) can be written in the 
form: 
5 = l.826Re;i/2, Re, = 2R,U,pp-‘, (19) 
5 = 0.8546x’/2Re’,/4. (20) 
These formulae are valid when p -=K 1 and this situa- 
tion corresponds to thermal spraying. 
The variations of the splat thickness 5 and the 
splat radius 5 with respect to the Reynolds number 
according to the analytical expressions (14) and (15) 
respectively are shown in Fig. 2. The splat thickness 
diminishes with Re and decreases when splat solidi- 
fication takes place. The difference between the val- 
ues of 5 corresponding to the cases p = 0 and 
p = 0.002 increases with increase of the Reynolds

number. The splat radius enhances with Re. It also 
increases when splat solidification occurs and de- 
creases in the case of droplet mass loss. 
The absolute value of the rate of the splat thick- 
ness variation increases with the Reynolds number 
according to (16) and splat solidification does not 
change it markedly (Fig. 3). It can be seen from Fig. 
3 that the rate of splat radius variation increases with 
Re according to (17). This parameter significantly 
enhances when splat solidification takes place and 
decreases in the case of droplet mass loss.

In Ref. [3] the dynamics of the splat flattening and 
solidification during plasma spraying of zirconia par- 
ticles on a smooth steel substrate was studied experi- 
mentally. We estimated that in this case the solidifi- 
cation velocity can be approximately determined as 
follows: 
v, = cY,7&)-‘, (21) 
where (Y, is the contact thermal heat transfer coeffi- 
cient at the substrate-coating interface, Tr is the 
temperature of the impinging droplet (particle), and 
K and p respectively are the latent heat of fusion and 
the density of zirconia. The average particle tempera- 
ture T, was found to be about 3660 K [3]. For 
zirconia K = 0.71 X lo6 J kg- ’ and p = 5400 kg 
m -j. Taking these values and (Y, = 3.8 X lo5 WmP2 
K-’ we obtain from (21) that v, = 0.366 m s-‘. If 
we assume that the impact velocity U = 150 m sP ’ 
[3] we have that p = 0.00244. 
Using this value of l3 and assuming that there is 
no droplet mass loss (x = 1) because the substrate is 
heated and its surface is smooth [3], we obtain from 
(15) the variation of the final radius of the splat 
(flattening degree) 5 with the Reynolds number 
shown in Fig. 4 together with the experimental data 
and their correlation. 
The theoretical values of 5 are not very sensitive 
to the particle velocity U which varies according to 
the particle size distribution. For example, when 
U= 100 m ss’ and CT= 200 m s-‘, the maximum 
relative variations of 5 do not exceed about 3% and 
9% correspondingly with respect to the case when 
U = 150 m SC’.

The theoretical values of 5 are more sensitive to 
the contact heat transfer coefficient ay,. When ay, 
varies from 3.3 X lo5 to 5 X lo5 W m-’ K-’ [3], 
the maximum deviations of 5 are between about 
13% and 32% with respect to the case when o_, = 
3.8 X lo5 W m-* K-l. 
The theoretical values of 5 are seen to agree well 
with the experimental results. 
5. Conclusions 
(1) The approximate formulae describing the time 
evolution of the thermally sprayed splat thickness 
and radius as well as the rates of their variation with 
time during the flattening process are established 
taking into account splat solidification and mass loss 
due to the splashing and the formation of craters in 
the surface where flattening occurs. 
(2) Realistic correlations between the final values 
of the splat thickness, radius and the rates of their 
variations and the Reynolds number are introduced. 
(3) The theoretical results obtained agree well 
with the experimental data and can be used for 
prediction purposes.
