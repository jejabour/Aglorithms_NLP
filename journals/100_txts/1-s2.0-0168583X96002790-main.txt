Abstract 
Bi,SrzCa,Cu,Os+a and YBa,Cu,O,_ a thin films were irradiated by 23 MeV C,, and 24 MeV Au, cluster ions from a 
tandem accelerator. The defect production of the C,, cluster ions in Bi,Sr,Ca,Cu,Os+ a exceeds that of 238U ions with an 
energy of 2.7 GeV. The analysis of the mechanism underlying the defect production leads to different conclusions: (i) for 
C,, clusters we find independence of nuclear and electronic contributions to the defect production as in the case of atomic 
projectiles, (ii) for Au, cluster ions this independence has lost it’s validity. A possible interpretation of the Au, results is 
that nuclear defects are annealed by the electronic energy loss. The size of the effective damage radii obtained for the 
Bi,Sr2Ca,Cu20s+s film may indicate that continuous tracks are formed in this film via the C,, and Au, irradiation. 
1. Introduction 
Fast atomic ions penetrating through high c supercon- 
ductor (HTSC) films are able to create latent tracks along 
the ion trajectory. The tracks consist of an amorphous core 
surrounded by a region left under strain [l-3]. The core 
radius or effective damage radius R,, increases with 
increasing energy deposited by the ion. A strict correlation 
is observed between R,, and the track morphology. Large 
R,, values (R,, > 3 nm) are related to columnar defects, 
i.e. continuous amorphous cylinders surrounding the ion 
trajectory [4]. These columnar defects are of particular 
interest for HTSC’s because they can act as pinning cen- 
ters for flux lines in the mixed state. 
To obtain large latent track radii very heavy (m > 
100 u) and very fast projectiles are required which are only 
available at the big heavy ion facilities. In this short note it 
is shown that C,, and Au, cluster ions with energies 
typical for a tandem accelerator are able to damage HTSC’s 
in a similar way. prepared on MgO (Bi-film) and SrTiO, by means of 
pulsed laser deposition [5,6]. The film thickness was deter- 
mined to be 230 A. The film parameters were investigated 
prior to the irradiation. The T,-values for the Bi and the 
123~films were 87 and 90 K, respectively. Samples with 
Cpole geometry were used to allow measurements of the 
electrical resistivity during the irradiation. 
The samples were irradiated at room temperature paral- 
lel to the c-axis with 23 MeV C,, and 24 MeV Au, 
cluster ions from the Orsay tandem accelerator [7]. The 
cluster fluence qbt was monitored in two different ways: 
(i) in case of the C,, beam secondary electrons emitted 
from the sample were continuously recorded with a chan- 
nel plate detector (the ratio between cluster and electron 
rates were known) and (ii) in case of the Au, beam a 
Faraday cup was periodically (every 10 min) inserted into 
the beam. The film resistivity was also periodically mea- 
sured with c$t increments of 0.5 X 10” cm-‘. 
3. Results and discussion 
2. Experimental 
High quality thin films of Bi,Sr,Ca,Cu,Os+, (called 
Bi-film in the following) and YBa,Cu,O,_, films (called 
123-film) were used for the investigations. The films were

exception of the a3*U data were obtained for warm samples (300 
K). The 238U data were measured at 125 K, one data point (at 
$t = 10” cm-‘) exists for the temperature T= 300 K. The 
atomic data are from Ref. [S]. 
It should be noted that the 2.7 GeV 238U data were 
obtained from a cold (125 K) sample, and that the number 
of defects is smaller at elevated temperatures as demon- 
strated in Fig. 1 for the 23*U data point with the highest 
fluence. This data point was obtained after annealing of the 
125 K irradiation damage. The 300 K curve for 2.7 GeV 
238U should approximately coincide with the p/p0 versus 
+r curve measured for the 24 MeV Au, cluster. This 
demonstrates that the defect production of both cluster ions 
exceeds or equals, respectively, the maximum defect pro- 
duction obtainable with an atomic ion (the maximum of 
the energy loss curve for 238U occurs roughly at 2.7 GeV).

comparable with that of a 865 MeV *08Pb beam (see Fig. 
21. 
It is interesting to examine the energy losses of the 
various projectiles of Figs. 1 and 2 with respect to the 
defect production of these ions (see Table 1). The energy 
loss values were obtained from the code TRIM (Version 
95.4) which is based on original work of Biersack et al. 
[9]. In case of the C,, and Au, clusters it was assumed 
that the cluster energy loss is the sum of the energy losses 
of the cluster constituents moving with the cluster velocity. 
This assumption seems to be justified according to the 
results obtained in [ 10,111. 
The electronic energy loss S, of the 23 MeV C,, 
cluster in the Bi-film is similar to the &-values of 2.7 GeV 
238U and 865 MeV *‘* Pb ions. Inspite of this similarity we 
observed the largest defect production for the C,, cluster. 
The nuclear energy losses S, for all three projectiles in the 
Bi-film are negligible compared to S, even though one has

Fig. 3. Nuclear defect indicator I’, deduced from the irradiation 
of Bi,Sr,CaCu,O,+ 6 films with atomic and cluster projectiles as 
a function of the nuclear energy losses S,. The hatched area 
represents the so called “nuclear band” [12]. Atomic ions with 
S,,-values which represent a major fraction of the total energy loss 
are characterized by open squares. For details see text. 
to note that S, for C,, is roughly one order of magnitude 
larger than in the case of the heavy atomic projectiles. 
The electronic energy loss of the 24 MeV Au, cluster 
in both HTSC-films is smaller than the S, values of all 
atomic ions listed in Table 1. The S, values of Au, are, on 
the other hand, not negligible compared to S,. In fact, both 
values are almost identical. Au, cluster ions and the 
atomic ions of Table 1 yield a similar defect production in 
spite of different partititions of the total energy loss. 
It is not obvious, a priori, how the energy losses of the 
cluster projectiles are related to the magnitude of the 
observed defect production. One could argue that only the 
electronic energy loss is responsible in case of the C,, 
clusters, whereas both S, and S, contribute if the projectile 
is Au,. Kraus et al. have demonstrated that nuclear and 
electronic contributions to the defect production overlay 
additively in case of 123-films [12] and Bi-films [13,14], 
i.e. that both contributions are independent in a first ap- 
proximation if the films are irradiated with atomic projec- 
tiles. This can be shown quantitatively by means of the 
defect indicator r, which is defined as 
r2 for the Bi-film is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the 
average nuclear energy loss of a number of atomic ions [8]. 
Protons and heavy ions with &,-values which represent a 
considerable portion of the total energy loss (open squares 
in Fig. 3) scale with S,, i.e. their r,-values form the 
“nuclear band” of the figure. These projectiles create 
defects mainly via nuclear collision cascades. This result could indicate that electronic and nuclear 
contributions to the defect production are not independent 
as in the case of atomic projectiles [ 13,141 if the Bi-film is 
irradiated with Au, cluster ions. Instead, multiplying ef- 
fects [ 151 may play a role: the electronic energy loss could 
for instance anneal the nuclear defects as observed already 
in case of crystalline metals [16]. Another explanation 
could be related to the fact that the electronic energy 
density E along the ion trajectory is much higher for Au, 
cluster ions than for the atomic projectiles. This is because 
the slow constituents of the cluster transfer a much smaller 
amount of energy onto secondary electrons than high 
energetic heavy ions. The amount of transferred energy 
determines, on the other hand, the range R, of the sec- 
ondary electrons which in turn determines the extension of 
the electronically excited region along the ion trajectory. 
Thus, similar S, values of cluster and atomic ions result in 
much larger E-values for cluster projectiles. In fact, an 
estimation for R, based on the formula given in [ 171 shows 
that R, for Au, is roughly 3 orders of magnitude smaller 
than for 2.7 GeV 238U resulting in a much higher E value 
for Au,. 
r,-values above the nuclear band (see Fig. 3) are Fig. 4 shows r, values for atomic projectiles [8,12-141 
observed for other atomic ions with energy losses which and 24 MeV Au, cluster ions as a function of S,. The 
are dominated by S, [f&13,14]. The deviations from the nuclear band is established up to S,, = 10’ keV/nm 1121. nuclear band are interpreted to be indications for an elec- 
tronic contribution to the defect production. This electronic 
contribution is characterized by means of the electronic 
defect indicator r,,e [12]. 
As demonstrated elsewhere [12] a threshold for the 
electronic defect production can be deduced from a plot of 
r,,e versus S,. The threshold value for the Bi-film is 
roughly S, = 2.3 keV/nm as obtained from atomic data; 
the r2,e-values increase linearly with S, above S, = 10 
keV/nm [8,13,14]. This is interpreted to be due to the fact 
that the defect morphology remains the same for S, > 10 
keV/nm and that only the size of the defects increases 
with increasing S, [ 121. 
Fig. 3 also exhibits the defect indicators of the cluster 
projectiles. It should be noted in this context that the data 
for the atomic projectiles are cold sample (125 K) data and 
that the defect production at low temperatures increases 
more steeply with increasing fluence than at the elevated 
temperatures of the present investigation. This means that 
the cluster indicators should be shifted to slightly higher 
values in Fig. 3. 
The r, value for Au, coincides with the nuclear band 
of Fig. 3. This would mean that the total defect production 
is due to nuclear processes provided that the concept used 
for atomic ions is applicable. Due to the relatively large 
electronic energy loss of Au, (see Table 1) one would 
expect, however, a considerable electronic contribution to 
the defect production i.e. that the Au, data point would be 
above the nuclear band. Even a temperature correction 
could not rise the measured Au, value to the expected 
value. 
Ch. Tomaschko et al. / Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B I1 7 (1996) 90-94 93 
The r, value for Au, is below the straight continuation of 
this band. This could be an indication for a peculiar 
behaviour of the Au, cluster or for the fact, that the 
nuclear band changes its slope above S, = 10’ keV/nm 
(dashed lines in Fig. 4). There are strong indications from 
recent measurements with atomic data [ 13,141 that the 
latter might be the case (see the additional atomic data 
labelled with triangles in Fig. 4). In this case the Au, data 
would fit onto the nuclear band. The r,,e indicator is 
much smaller than expected from the magnitude of S, (see 
Table 1 and Fig. 5), provided that nuclear and electronic 
contributions are independent as in the case of atomic 
projectiles. 
The result obtained for the Bi-film irradiated with 23 
MeV C,, projectiles differs significantly from the Au, 
result: the defect indicator r, exceeds the values of the 
nuclear band (see Fig. 3), the electronic contribution has 
almost ‘the value expected for the electronic energy loss of 
C, according to irradiation experiments with atomic ions. 
The result seems to indicate that C,, projectiles behave 
like atomic ions and that nuclear and electronic processes 
contribute independently to the defect production. The 
greatly differing results for C,, and Au, lead, of course, to 
the question whether and why different mechanisms are 
effective for the defect production induced by cluster ions. 
To clarify this question further experiments with cluster 
ions of various SJS, ratios are desirable. 
From the measured p/p, versus q5t curves (Figs. 1 
and 2) the area A of the amorphous cores produced by the 
cluster irradiation were determined. One can easily show 
[ 181 that the connection between p/pc, r$t and A is given 
by the expression 
p/p0 = e2A+’

provided that the defect producing ions hit the sample in a 
totally random way and that the damaged volume can be 
packed into a cylinder along the ion path having the cross 
section A = vrR& where R,, is the effective damage 
radius introduced above. The R,, values obtained for C, 
and Au, are given in Table 1 together with R,, and R,,, 
values for atomic projectiles (R,, is the defect radius 
obtained from a high resolution TBM analysis). In case of 
the Bi-film one obtains R, values from cluster ions 
which belong to the range V in the classification scheme 
of Meftah et al. [3]. The different ranges (II-V) of this 
scheme characterize different defect morphologies. In range 
V the defects are long cylinders of amorphous material 
(continues tracks), in range IV the defects represent over- 
lapping cylinders (discontinous tracks). Range V covers 
effective damage radii R,, > 3 nm. With respect to this 
classification one expects discontinues tracks for the irradi- 
ation of the 123~film with 24 MeV Au, and continues 
tracks for the Bi-film irradiated both with Au, and 23 
MeV C,,. 
The actual defect morphology can only be safely deter- 
mined, of course, by means of high resolution transmission 
electron microscopy (HRTBM). With the aid of HRTBM 
micrographs it has been shown recently [ 191 that 18 MeV 
C,, ions are able to produce continues tracks in metallic 
samples. Thus, it is not unreasonable to speculate that 
similar tracks result from the irradiation of Bi-films with 
23 MeV C,, cluster ions.

4. Conclusion 
As result of the present investigations we find that the 
defect production in Bi,Sr,Ca,Cu,O,+ a and YBa,Cu,- 
O,_, thin films induced by the irradiation with 23 MeV 
C,, and 24 MeV Au, cluster ions is comparable or even 
larger than the defect production of heavy and very ener- 
getic atomic ions. The analysis of the damage mechanism 
in terms of a model developed for the irradiation of HTSC 
films with atomic projectiles leads to two different results: 
6) the C,, cluster ions seem to behave like atomic ions 
and (ii) the Au, ions behave differently and give reason to 
conjecture that the independence of nuclear and electronic 
contributions to the defect production, which holds in the 
case of atomic projectiles, is not valid in this case. It could 
be that nuclear defects are annealed by the electronic 
energy deposition in case of the Au, irradiation similar to 
observations made for crystalline metals. 
The large defect radii deduced for the Bi,Sr,Ca,Cu,- 
0 s+ 6 film irradiated both with Au, and C,, clusters may 
indicate that continues tracks are formed in this film.
