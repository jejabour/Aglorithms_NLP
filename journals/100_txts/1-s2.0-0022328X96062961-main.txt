Abstract 
Oxometal complexes of molybdenum and tungsten in high oxidation states form stable adducts with 1,3-dimethylimidazoline-2-ylidene 
(L) 1. The first "carbene' complexes of molybdenum(VI) [MoO2CI(L)3]CI (3a) and tungsten(VI) WO2CI2(L) 2 (4b) are reported. 
Key~twrds: Molybdenum(V1); Tungsten(Vl); lmidazol;ne-2-ylidene; Heterocyclic carbenes 
1. Introduction 
N-Heterocyclic carbenes derived from imidazolium 
and pyrazolium salts by deprotonation ate well-estab- 
lished ligands in organometailic chemistry, and they 
particularly cover the chemistry of low oxidation-state 
transition metal complexes [2,3]. The N-heterocyclic 
carbene L ~ 1.3-dimethylimidazoline-2-ylidet, e (1) 
seems to reveal universal ligand properties in metal 
coordination chemistt~ [I o~4]. In addition to pronounced 
tr-donor properties (as for example seen in the complex 
[CIBeLa]C! [5]), this ligand is normally stable against 
oxidation when coordinated in oxometal complexes [6]. 
To extend the chemistry of oxomolybdenum and oxo- 
tungsten complexes, which are known as excellent 
epoxidation catalysts, we now report the synthesis of 
the first stable molybdenum(Vl) and tungsten(Vl) car- 
bene derivatives. 
2. Results and discussion 
MoO2Cl2(thf) 2 (2a) and WO2Cl2(thf) 2 (2b) are 
formed as intermediates by dissolving MoO2CI 2,

Pll S0022-328X(96)06296- I MoO2Cl2(dmf) 2 and WO2Cl 2 in thf at -20 °C. The 
new carbene 'adducts' 3a and 4b are prepared by 
adding three equivalents of free carbene I (dissolved in 
thf) at -20 °C to thf solutions of 2a and 2b respec- 
tively. 
After stirring for 2 h, purple (molybdenum) 3a and 
green (tungsten) 4b solids precipitate (Scheme !). The 
proposed structures of 3a and 4b are shown in Fig. I; 
they tire in accord with the analytical data derived front 
NMR, IR, elemental analysis and mass spectroscopy. 
The tH and especially the ':~C NMR spectra prove that 
the complexation of the ligand l is to the metal center 
of the molybdenum and the tungsten derivatives. The 
signal of the carbene-C nucleus is shifted ca. 40 ppm to 
higher field, upon complexation of the ligand to the 
metal: 8--177 ppm (3a, 3b) and at 187 ppm (4b) 
compared with 8 - 215 ppm of the free ligand I. Two 
signal groups of the carbene ligano can be observed for 
3a. In contrast to 3a, only one signal group of the 
carbene ligand is detected for 4b. 
Three different signal groups are also found for 
another molybdenum complex Mo(CO)3L3 (three car- 
bene ligands not chemically equivalent). Interestingly, 
the t3C NMR carbene-C signals of 3a, 3b, and 4b are 
shifted to lower field in comparison with known low- 
oxidation state complexes (190-210 ppm) [7]. This 
observation is in accord with the chemical shift of the 
rhenium(Vll)-'carbene' complex CH3ReOaL2, 
8C(carbene) = 1", 6.1 ppm (CDCI3, 20 °C). Elemental 
analyses and the NMR data (Table l) of the isolated 
complexes 3a, 4b prove that 3a, represents a triscarbene

Scheme 2. Protonation and decomposition of 3a (!--1,3- 
dimethylimidazolin-2-ylidene). Further hydrolysis of the intermediate 
$a leads to molybdate(IV). 
The resulting cationic complex is quite rare a feature for 
molybdenum(Vl) species [8]. In the electroneutral tung- 
sten complex 4a, the carbene ligands are also in the 
plane of the cis-dioxotungsten core. 
Decomposition of 3a can be followed by 13C NMR 
spectroscopy. An additional different signal group is 
detected at 8 = 177.0, 123.2 and 36.4 ppm after 1 h in 
ordinary CDCI 3 and DMSO-d 6, proving the presence of 
the complex MoO2CIaL 2 3b, which then decomposes 
by treatment with the acidic solvent CDCI 3 to the 
imidazolium salt, as seen in the NMR spectra (Table 1). 
The initial step of this degradation reaction is the proto- 
nation of the oxygen atom of 3a, enhancing the Lewis 
acidity of the metal center which is then easily attacked 
by water (Scheme 2). After protonation, rapid hydroly- 
sis takes place to yield molybdate(Vl). 
3. Conclusion 
complex while 4b exhibits only two of these ligands. 
(In the case of the tungsten complex 4b, the elemental 
analysis indicates impurities of an oxotungsten species). 
In the IR spectra the stretching bands of the cis.di- 
oxomolybdenum and the cis-dioxotungsten fragment 
arc found, each with two absorptions of ca. 910 cm-i 
(3a) and ca. 940 cm ° m (4). The characteristic absorp- 
tions of the carbene ligand are also present. Complex 3a 
should exhibit the two equivalent carbene ligands in the 
plane, of the cis-dioxygen molybdenum core. The third 
carbene ligand is then located trans to the chloro ligand. Our results show that the N-heterocyclic carl~ne 1 is 
so flexible in its electronic structure that it tolerates 
even strongly Lewis acidic metals in high oxidation 
states. However, hydrolysis is a prevalent feature here, 
so catalytic applications in the presence of water (e.g. 
olefin epoxidation with H20 2) are outside the scope of 
application [9]. A comparison with known dioxometal 
halides containing u-donor molecules shows that 
cationic molybdenyl complexes of type [MoO2CIL~] + 
CI- are not known for ligands other than the present 
heterocyclic carbene, while electroneutral derivatives

4. Experimental part 
All experiments have been carried out by using 
standard Schlenk techniques and completely dry sol- 
vents (water content: less than 1 ppm; Karl-Fischer 
titrations). The starting material MoO2C! 2, MoO2CI 2- 
(dmf) 2 and WO2CI 2 are prepared as described in the 
literature [13-15]. 'nae quality of these extremely air- 
and moisture-sensitive starting materials, that contain 
normally hydrolytic by-products, governs the success of 
the described synthesis. They thus must be purified 
several times before use. 
The NMR spectra were recorded on an FF-Jeol 
GX-400 instrument. NMR solvents were 'freeze- 
pump-thaw' degassed and stored over molecular sieves 
before use. Elemental analyses were performed in the 
Microanalytical Laboratory of our institute. ~i-values 
(NMR) are given in ppm. 
4.1. Purification of the precursor complexes MoO z Cl 2 , 
MoO,Clz(dmf) 2 , WO,,CI 2 
MoO2C! 2 can be purified by sublimation. MoO2CI 2 
was triply sublimed in order to remove the decomposi- 
tion products (as 'molybdenum blue'). The dimethylfor- 
mamide adduct of the MoO2CI 2 was prepared as de- 
scribed in Ref. [14]. but washed five times with dry 
acetone, thus obtaining a put~ material in low yield but 
as an acid-free product. In the case of the tungsten 
precursor the only way to purify WO2C! 2 is subliming 
WOCI4 because sublimation at the WO2C! 2 step ;.~ not 
possible.

-20 °C. A purple precipitate forms within 2 h. After 
filtration the product was washed twice with diethyl 
ether and was then dried for 2 days in an oil-pump 
vacuum. Yield: 0.,,°,2 g (37%) of 3a. Anal. Found: C,
