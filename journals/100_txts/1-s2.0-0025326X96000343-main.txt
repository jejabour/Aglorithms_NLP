The distribution and origin of non-aromatic hydrocarbons 
(NAH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAIl) 
were investigated in surface sediments from the lagoons of 
'Grand Cul-de-Sac Matin' and 'Petit Cul-de-Sac Matin' 
in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe (61°30'W, 16°N). 
Both are surrounded by a mangrove ecosystem. Hydro- 
carbons extracted from sediments were fractioned by 
chromatography adsorption and analysed by gas chroma- 
tography. NAIl concentrations ranged from 28.2-4104.4 
lag g-1 of dry sediment and from 103-1656.5 ng g-t for 
PAIl. We founded that naturally occurring hydrocarbons 
predominated along the coastline. The harbour zone's 
sediment is polluted by petroleum hydrocarbons. PAHs in 
sediments are medium and high molecular weight residues 
with a pyrolytic origin. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier

The Caribbean island of Guadeloupe (61°30"W, 16°N) 
is a rapidly developing society with strong industrial 
and agricultural sectors. Two lagoons, the 'Grand 
Cul-de-Sac Marin' (GCSM) in the north and the 'Petit 
Cul-de-Sac Marin' (PCSM) in the South (Fig. 1), lie on 
both sides of the island's major urban centre, Pointe-/L- 
Pitre, where half of the population of the island lives. 
Both lagoons are connected by a narrow channel 
running south-north: the 'Rivirre Salre'. To assess the 
anthropogenic influence on coastal zones, concentra- 
tions of aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAH and NAH, respectively) from n-Cl0 to n-C35 
were measured in sediments from these lagoons. The 
PCSM primarily receives sewage and wastewater from 
local industries and shipping traffic. The GCSM receives 
freshwater from an intensively cultivated agricultural 
zone drained by the 'Grande Rivirre ~ Goyaves' 
(GRG). The sediment samples were collected in both 
lagoons: six in the mouth of the GRG river (west side 
of the GCSM), three in the east side of the GCSM, 
and four in the PCSM 0aarbour zone) as indicated in 
Fig. 1. Materials and Methods 
Thirteen surface samples were collected by divers 
using a PVC hand-held corer (10 cm internal diameter, 
70 cm length) during two sampling periods in February 
and December 1993. Within hours, the cores were 
extruded and the top part (down to 3-5 cm) frozen until 
analysis. After freeze-drying, the sediments were forced 
through a 200 ~m sieve to discard organic detritus. For 
basic classification purposes, the texture and organic 
carbon content (%OC) of the sediments were deter- 
mined by wet sieving (AFNOR, 1983) and wet 
sulphochromic oxidization (AFNOR, 1985). 
Hydrocarbons were extracted in a soxhlet apparatus 
with a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane (1:1 v/v). 
Aliquots of about 20 g were treated once with 200 ml of 
solvent. A known amount of n-Cls:l was spiked as an 
internal standard before soxhlet extraction. This 
procedure typically gives recoveries of the hydrocarbons 
in the range of 70-100% (Bernard, 1994). NAH and 
PAH fractions were isolated by adsorption chromato- 
graphy on Silica and Alumina. Organic solvents, 
sodium sulphate, Silica (Silica gel 60) and Alumina 
(Aluminium Oxide 90) were from MERCK (quality 'for 
residue analysis'). Both fractions were analysed by gas 
chromatography. Chromatograms were obtained with a 
Hewlett Packard 5890A Gas Chromatograph including 
a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and a on-column 
injector. The fused capillary column was 25 m long, 0.32 
mm internal diameter, coated with methyl silicone, 0.52 
~tm thick. The temperature rose from 60 to 105°C at a 
rate of 15°C rain -1 and from 105 to 295°C at a rate of 
4°C min- 1. The injector and detector temperatures were 
respectively set at 280 and 300°C. Helium was used as a 
carrier gas. Hydrocarbons were identified and quanti- 
fied by comparison of their retention times with those of 
known standards injected under the same conditions. 
The analytical standards for PAH and NAH were 
provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
A few samples were also analysed by mass spectrometry 
(electron impact ionization at 70 eV) using similar GC 
conditions, to confirm the identification of doubtful

peaks. A control solution was run to check for solvent 
purity and possible contamination from the adsorption 
column. Although no peak was higher than 3% of the 
corresponding ones obtained with the sample extracts, 
each sample was blank corrected before conversion to 
concentration units. For the unresolved components, 
the methods described by Burns & Villeneuve (1983) 
were applied. Individual PAHs were confirmed on the 
basis of retention time and mass spectra. 
Results and discussion 
Sediment characterization 
Results of the granulometric analysis are given in 
Table 1. Sediment characteristics varied over a wide 
range depending on the sampling site, confirming the 
diversity (complexity) of the environment in the GCSM 
(river discharge, coral reef, mangrove and seagrasses). 
This analysis revealed: 
• an asymmetric distribution of the grain from coarse 
to fine; 
• a large dispersion due to a wrong classification. 
In the GCSM, sediments (Stations 1--6) from the west 
side near the mouth of the river 'C-rande Rivi~re Goyaves' were generally brown-black sandy terrigenous 
mud with an average of 1.82% organic carbon (%OC). 
They were from ferralitic soils. These sandy deposits 
were also characterized by high vegetal detritus (leaves, 
branches). This is typical of estuarine areas, especially in 
a mangrove environment (Snedaker, 1978). Surface 
sediments from the east side of the GCSM (Stations 7 
and 8) consisted of gray calcareous silty mud. The 
percentage of organic carbon was close to 4%; these 
calcareous sediments were near seagrasses. Therefore 
leaves of Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium fili- 
forme, two species of seagrasses, were found in these 
samples. 
Surface sediments from the PCSM (Stations 10-13) 
consisted of sandy or muddy particles with levels of 
organic carbon ranging widely from 0.52 to 10% 
considering Stations 10 and 12 (Table 2). Deposits 
were terrigenous (10 and 11) or calcareous (12 and 13). 
Non-aromatic hydrocarbons (NAH) 
Concentration of main hydrocarbon series and 
diagnostic criteria characteristics are given in Table 2. 
The total concentration (I-IT) of the hydrocarbons in 
the area studied varied from 25.4 ttg g-1 (marine zone)

to 4104.4 I~g g-' (harbour zone). The value of the 
different ratios are also presented: 
• HT/CO (HT/%OC.104) generally less than 70 for 
unpolluted sediments (Philippi, 1965; Farrington & 
Tripp, 1977; Marchand & Roucache, 1981). This ratio 
varied from 8.7 to 1327.4. 
• The ratio U/R, U was the unresolved signal 
quantified by use of an average response factor over 
the elution range indicated, R was the resolved signal. 
This ratio varied from 0.2 to 1247. 
• The carbon preference index (CPI) of n-alkanes, 
changed from 0.3 to 16.2, calculated in the carbon range 
23-33. 
In the GCSM, the values show: 
• For the calcareous sediments, hexanic extracts were 
characterized by a distribution of n-alkanes from n-Cla 
to n-C34 with a maximum (Cmax), n-C29_31. NAH 
accounted for 86.5% to 99% of total hydrocarbon; the 
fraction U only accounted for 13%. Isoprenoid 
hydrocarbons, Pristane (Pr) and Phytane (Ph) were 
generally found on calcareous sediment. Their concen- 
trations varied from 0.3 to 3602 ng g-l. 
• For the terrigenous sediments, concentrations of 
hydrocarbons varied from 25.4 to 1242.5 I~g g-l. 
• All samples contained only small amounts of the 
lower alkanes. 
For samples collected in the PCSM, the results of 
concentrations show fluctuating levels between 18.6 
I~g g-1 and 4104.4 ~tg g-l. In the marine zone (Stations 12 and 13) we found a small amount of hydrocarbons 
(<29.4 lag g-l) while in the harbour zone more than 
1000 ~tg g-1 of hydrocarbons were adsorbed on the 
sandy or muddy particles (Stations 10 and 11). The 
highest concentration of hydrocarbons were found for 
Station 10 (Table 2). Analyses of the different fractions 
have revealed the existence of several species of organic 
compounds such as n-alkanes, isoprenoids as well as 
polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons. No matter the 
station, the fraction U accounted for 89.7% of the 
HT. All the terrigenous samples contained small 
amounts of the lower alkanes except in the harbour 
zones. Therefore the chromatographic profile obtained 
for the sediments of the two lagoons was very complex. 
The hydrocarbons were from a mixture of different 
sources; four groups stand out: 
The first group (Stations, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8) included 
calcareous and terrigenous sediments, characterized by 
HT/CO < 50 and U/R < 5. For the patterns, similar 
trends, such as the predominance of high molecular 
weight in the range of n-C23-34, were found. These 
sediments were influenced by terrestrial inputs such as 
mangroves detritus (Stations 2, 4 and 6) or by tropical 
seagrasses (Stations 7 and 8). Identical shapes of our 
chromatographic resultswere found in mangrove soils 
(Scherrer, 1988; Oudot & Dutrieux, 1989). The strong 
evidence of mangrove detritus incorporation into 
surface sediments was the shift in the maximum 
alkane carbon from predominantly 29 or 31. We also 
736 

Volume 32/Number 10/October 1996 
founded the same profiles in suspended matter in the 
river water column or in the dissolved and particulate 
phase of seawater (Bernard et aL, 1995). These 
foundings have confirmed the contribution of mangrove 
detritus to adjacent nearshore areas. We also noted 
another contribution due to the dead leaves of Thalassia 
testudinum and Syringodium filiforme, two seagrasses, 
broadly distributed in the two lagoons. Seagrasses are 
also known as sources of organic carbon (Newell et al., 
1986). Large amounts of fresh leaf material were 
frequently detached from the plants and deposited on 
the sediment. Such deposits were exposed to leaching or 
burying into the soils. They had probably conditioned 
the distribution of hydrocarbons on the sediments of the 
Stations 7 and 8. 
-- The second group (Stations 1 and 3) was also made 
up of sediments from coasts near the mangrove forest. 
These sediments were characterized by a HT/CO ratio 
> 100, an important fraction U (respectively 214.5 and 
152.54 lag g-~). The U/R ratio was < 3.6 and the CPI 
was < 5.9. The U fraction was probably due to a high 
rate of subsurface bacterial activity. Process in 
mangrove included rapid deposition of organic matter 
followed by a rapid bacterial degradation (Alongi et al., 
1993). 
-- The third group included surface sediment from the 
PCSM (Stations 12 and 13), and consisted of sandy 
particles with levels of organic carbon < 1.35%. The 
values of the CPI were equal to 5.3 and 0.3 respectively. 
The level of HT was < 30 lag g- ~, the HT/CO ratio was 
< 50, the ratio U/R was > 20. The values of the U/R 
ratio indicated that there had been a total degradation 
of hydrocarbons--these sediments were not polluted. 
For these three groups the concentration of Pr and Ph 
were less than 261.5 ng g-l. We did not find these 
compounds in the terrigenous sediments except for 
Station 3. The minor amount of isoprenoids suggested 
little or no zooplankton contribution in sediments near 
the mouth of the GRG. However there was a possibility 
that some preferential degradation or evaporation of 
the lower hydrocarbons (isoprenoids and n-alkanes) was 
occuring. Suspended particles' waters were also char- 
acterized by small contributions of lower hydrocarbons 
(Bernard et al., 1995). Concentrations founded on 
calcareous sediments confirm the marine input through 
different isoprenoids' precursors like zooplankton, 
marine animals and plants, photosynthetic and non- 
photosynthetic bacterial metabolism. -- The fourth group (Stations 10 and 11) included 
Stations from the Harbour zone and from the .narrow 
channel the 'Rivirre Salre', (Station 9), exhibits all the 
characteristics of polluted sediments likewise the over- 
laying seawater (Bernard et al., 1995). There was a 
significant accumulation of light hydrocarbons, coming 
from petroleum hydrocarbons, in the muddy sediments 
of Station 10 (Fig. 2). We found high levels of 
hydrocarbons (> 1000 lag g- 1) and isoprenoids, U/R 
ratio > 5, HT/CO ratio > 70. Pollution input caused by 
hydrocarbons mostly used in shipping was noted. These 
suggested a high input of anthropogenic hydrocarbons 
in the harbour zone of the PCSM and in the GCSM 
across the 'Rivirre Salre'. 
Aromatic hydrocarbons 
The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydro- 
carbons (PAH) varied in the range 103-1656.5 ng g- i in 
the sediment samples of the two lagoons (Table 3). No 
PAH was found on the calcareous sediments (Stations 
7, 8, 12, 13) and on terrigenous sediments of Stations 6 
and 10. Seven out of nine terrigenous sediment samples 
were contaminated by PAH (Table 3). They usually 
contained PAH with six different aromatic structures. 
Phenanthrene (178), fluoranthene and pyrene (202), 
chrysene (228), benzo(e)pyrene and perylene (252) 
indeno(1,2,3,-cd)pyrene and Benzo(ghi)perylene, (276), 
were the most abundant congeners (Table 3). These 
isomers are linear and their presence in such propor- 
tions was usually taken as an indication of anthro- 
pogenic and/or combustion products (Laflamme & 
Hires, 1978). PAHs such as acenaphtene, acenaphtylene 
and 2, 3, 6 trimethyl naphtalene were only marginally 
detected (Station 9). 
The sediment samples contained PAHs at concentra- 
tions within the range founded in other mangrove 
environments (Kleskowski et al., 1994; Smith et al., 
1985), in Bermuda harbours (Burns et al., 1990) or in 
the Rhone Delta and Western Mediterranean (Lipiatou 
& Saliot, 1991). The sediments showed a predominance 
of compounds with mass 202 and 252. This profile was 
the most commonly observed in marine particulate and 
shelf sediment (Hites et al., 1980; Bates et al., 1984; 
Lipiatou & Saliot, 1991). Global concentrations of these 
compounds were higher at Stations 3 and 9. Station 3 
received freshwater from the GRG whereas Station 9 
received marine water from the Pointe-fi-Pitre harbour. 
Perylene and benzo(e)pyrene were the most abundant

congeners in these two Stations. Diagenetic production 
of perylene has been demonstrated in anoxic sediment 
(Venkatesan, 1988). Mangrove environments were 
characterized by exchanges between the litter forest 
and the coastal water (Snedaker, 1978). Dissolved and 
particulate matters are exported tidally. These contribu- 
tions affect the soil redox potential level. It evolves 
towards reducing conditions. Anoxic conditions and 
high levels of organic carbon are preferential for uptake 
and conservation of such compounds. 
Sediments in both harbours predominantly retained 
the heavier PAHs (mass 252 and 276). These are likely 
to be formed in fires from forests or the nearby rubbish 
dump (Fig. 1; Bernard, 1994). The pattern founded in 
Station 9 (Fig, 3) illustrated this hypothesis well. 
Combustion inputs were transported by air or by run- 
off (land particles) and deposited into the lagoon. Then 
they were concentrated in sediment along the tropical 
coastline like decayed mangrove detritus. 
Conclusions 
Hydrocarbons on terrigenous and calcareous sedi- 
ments of the two lagoons, 'Grand Cul-de-Sac Matin' 
and 'Petit Cul-de-Sac Matin' have been investigated. 
These sediments contained high levels of organic 
carbons and hydrocarbons. The results suggest that 
the compounds in the surface sediments of the two 
lagoons are mainly n-alkanes. Sediments in the PCSM 
are polluted by petroleum hydrocarbons. In the GCSM, 
the linear fraction is dominated by higher plants' or 
seagrasses' n-alkanes whereas the PAHs fraction is the 
result of combustion relicts. Atmospheric transports 
and river discharge contribute to the relatively high 
proportion of PAHs for this pristine area. Chemical 
conditions in coastal mangrove environments (anoxic 
conditions, high primary production and peat deposits) 
are suitable for the preservation of anthropogenic 
inputs.
