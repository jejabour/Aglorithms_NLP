Abstract 
This study reports U-Th disequilibrium data obtained by mass spectrometry for basaltic glasses collected along the 
Azores platform portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (37”30’-40”30’N), a region characterized by both a geochemical and 
bathymetric gradient. High Th and U concentrations, as well as Th/U ratios, document an enriched geochemical signature. 
cz3’Th/ 238U) activity ratios range from 1.20 to 1.35 and are thus systematically larger than most EPR MORBs reported in 
the literature. (2WTh/ 232Th) activity ratios show remarkable homogeneity for multiple samples taken from single dredge 
hauls. Additionally, samples with the highest Th concentrations (2.4 ppm) have among the highest Th isotope ratios. Taken 
together, these observations rule out assimilation of *?h-rich sediment as an explanation for the 230Th-238U systematics. 
The relatively large 230Th excesses in the erupted lavas may be related to the influence of the enriched Azores mantle plume 
source. The lack of observed correlations between 230 Tb excess and trace element and isotopic indices of source enrichment, 
however, rules out source composition as an explanation for the variations in (230Th/ 238U). 
Excess ~3’ Th is correlated with the axial depth of the ridge in the study area, with the shallowest portions showing the 
largest extents of disequilibrium. This may reflect more melting in the presence of garnet for the shallow segments, and 
suggests that melting begins well within the garnet peridotite stability field (- 35 kbar) in the mantle beneath the Azores 
segment of the MAR. 
At the ridge segment scale, 230Th excesses tend to be smaller near segment boundaries. This could reflect differences in 
the melting process or less frequent magmatism in these zones. These results demonstrate the potential for U-Th systematics 
to constrain the depth and degree of melting as well as the rate of mantle upwelling, even in the presence of source chemical 
heterogeneity.

plume. The extent of the geochemical anomaly pro- 
vides an indication of the scale and nature of ridge- 
hotspot interaction. In this paper, we report the first 
study of ridge-hotspot interaction using U-Th dise- 
quilibria. 
Unlike most other isotope systems, U-Th disequi- 
librium is not simply related to source geochemistry. 
Instead, the extent of U-Th disequilibrium is primar- 
ily a function of the melting process [1,2]. The time 
dependence of U-lb disequilibrium can also provide 
constraints on the rate of melt generation [2,3]. We 
have thus measured U-Th systematics in a series of 
young MORB samples collected along the Mid- 
Atlantic Ridge near the Azores during the cruise 
AII-129 of the RV Aflunris II (FAZAR expedition). 
The region we have selected for this study is the 
northern limb of a geochemical gradient on the 
Azores plateau over a distance of approximately 300 
km. We examine this data in conjunction with major 
and trace elements to investigate melt generation and 
its relationship to source variations, ridge-plume 
interaction and ridge segmentation. 
2. Evidence for ridge-hotspot interaction on the 
Azores plateau 
Numerous geophysical studies have documented 
anomalies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) near 
the Azores. This region of the North Atlantic is 
characterized by a funnel-shaped bathymetric swell. 
The lateral extent of this swell is widest at the 
MAR-Azores intersection. The ridge axis itself also 
shows a long-wavelength bathymetric high between 
37”N and 41”N. Seismic refraction [4] studies as well 
as detailed modelling of the gravity field [51 have 
shown that crustal thickness in this region could be 
60% greater than normal. The morphology of the 
ridge axis is itself anomalous in the region where the 
bathymetty is shallowest; the axial valley is less 
marked and the segments are swollen. This is analo- 
gous to the Reykjanes Ridge where segments closer 
to Iceland have no rift valley [6,7]. Similar anomalies 
are visible on large-scale gravity maps [8] with resid- 
ual gravity anomalies as great as - 30 mgal on the 
Azores platform. Modelling of these features has 
shown that they can be explained by a large mass of 
anomalously hot mantle (AT - 75°C) located at a depth of a few hundred kilometers [8]. This hot 
upper mantle may be related to thermal (or chemical) 
anomalies in the mantle beneath the Azores platform. 
The geophysical anomalies have also been modeled 
by Sleep [9], who estimated a buoyancy flux of 1.1 
Mg . se1 for the Azores plume. 
Evidence for the interaction of plume-derived ma- 
terial with the MAR plumbing system derives from 
geochemical studies. Long-wavelength sampling ( > 
1000 km) has shown that variations in La/Sm and 
other trace element and isotopic parameters along the 
MAR near the Azores reflect the interaction of nor- 
mal-ridge source material with plume-derived en- 
riched material [lo]. This enriched mantle is charac- 
terized by radiogenic Pb and Sr isotope ratios, and 
low 3He/4He [lo-181. The origin of this enrich- 
ment has variously been attributed to recycled oceanic 
crust, sediments, and/or mantle metasomatism 
[11,16,17,19]. Major elements were also shown to be 
anomalous in MORB from the Azores platform [20], 
the trace element enrichment in the Azores mantle 
source being associated with an apparent depletion in 
Fe. This major element anomaly affects the crystal- 
lization path for the Azores E-MORB, leading to the 
earlier appearance of clinopyroxene than for N- 
MORB [11,13]. 
3. Description of the sampling area 
We present data for five ridge segments located 
on the Azores platform between 37”30’N and 
40”30’N (Fig. 1). The morphology, bathymetry and 
gravity anomalies for this region have been de- 
scribed by Needham et al. [21]. One segment located 
north of the region mapped by Needham et al. [Zll 
was also sampled and its bathymetry was established 
by SEABEAM during the FAZAR cruise 1221 (Fig. 
2). 
The northern boundary of the study region is the 
Kurchatov fracture zone at 40”30’N. The ridge shal- 
lows rapidly to the south, and the rift valley gradu- 
ally diminishes. At the summit of the Azores plat- 
form, there is no marked rift valley and little change 
in axial depth along the ridge segment. More pro- 
nounced bathymetry variation at segment boundaries 
occur around the southernmost segments (KP-4 and 
KP-5, Fig. 2). 
3. Bourdan et al. /Earrh and Planetary Science L.etters I42 (1996117St89 177 
Large mantle Bouguer anomalies (MBA) found in 
this region [8] could reflect both mantle temperature 
and crustal thickness variations. On a gravity profile, 
the largest calculated crustal thicknesses are found in 
segment KP-2 and KP-3 where the crust could be 
3-4 km thicker. The variations in MBA and 
bathymetry near segment boundaries have been in- terpreted as thinner crust resulting from focused 
upwelling at segment midpoints [5,23]. 
4. Sample collection and preparation 
Samples were collected both by dredging and by 
rock coring using a technique described in [22,24].

were selected for U-Th analysis.

U-series studies require collection of ‘zero age’ sam- 
ples, which was made possible by a high resolution 
SIMRAD map [21], made available to us by D. 
Needham at IFREMER, and by the use of GPS and 
SEABEAM during the rock sampling. A mislocation 
of about 1 km represents 100,000 yr, on a slow- 
spreading ridge (half-rate 10 mm . yr - ’ ), which is 
very significant compared to the half-life of 230Th 
(- 75,000 yr). A much younger age for the samples 
is, however, indicated by the absence of sediment 
occurring with the glass in the rock core samples. 
(Studies in the EPR have shown that samples of 
crust as young as 20,000 yr old return sediments in 
the rock core samples.) Furthermore, in the study 
region, the ridge axis is well defined and narrow and 
shipboard estimates of the distance between sample 
locations and the ridge axis are less than a few 
hundred meters, consistent with the absence of sedi- 
ment. Almost no visible alteration is present on the 
glass chips used in this study. However, there could 
some tens of thousands of years uncertainty in the 
postulated age; the effect of this on the data distribu- 
tion is discussed later. Dredge and rock core loca- 
tions are given in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 2. 
Glass fragments were broken off pillow lavas and 
then chipped in a steel mortar to make small frag- 
ments that were washed in an ultrasonic bath with 
ethanol. Glass chips (< 750 pm) were carefully 
picked under the microscope, avoiding all oxides or 
alteration coatings and then ground by hand in an 
agate mortar. For U-Th disequilibrium mass spec- 
trometric measurements, 50-100 mg of glass was 
leached in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and 2.5 N 
HCl for 10 min at room temperature. This technique 
efficiently dissolves Mn-oxides without significantly 
leaching U and Th out of the glass [25]. The dissolu- 
tion and chemical extraction of U and Th is de- 
scribed in [25]. The samples were analyzed on the 
Lamont Isolab 54 by SIMS (Th) and TIMS @I> [251. 
The accuracy of (230Th/238U) measurements is 
about 1% (2 u). Two or three samples from six 
dredges were analyzed to test for within-dredge het- 
erogeneity. Because of the relatively small amount of 
glass available in rock cores, only one sample from 
each was analyzed. 
Major and trace elements were analyzed on board 
by direct current plasma emission spectrometty on 
50 mg aliquots of hand picked and ultrasonically cleaned glass. The uncertainty on Ba and Sr concen- 
trations is 5 ppm. Major elements were re-analyzed 
at Lamont by electron microprobe. 
5. Results 
5.1. Regional variations in major and trace elements 
Table 1 reports major element concentrations for 
the samples that were collected during the FAZAR 
cruise. Na,., and Fe,,, as defined by Klein and 
Langmuir [26] have been plotted as a function of 
latitude on Fig. 2. Both curves are characterized by 
extreme values around 38”30’N. However, Fe and 
Na cannot be interpreted directly in terms of pressure 
and degree of melting, as in 126,271, because it has 
been shown that Na and Fe along the MAR are 
significantly affected by the Azores mantle plume 
[ 11,131. High Ba/TiO, ratios near the Azores docu- 
ment the maximum extent of plume-ridge interac-

U-Th data for FAZAR glasses are reported in 
Table 2. Th concentrations range between 0.14 and 
2.4 ppm. This is a remarkably large range for a 
single sample suite. All of the samples are enriched 
relative to normal EPR MORB (Th - 0.1 ppm) and 
the highest concentrations are comparable to some 
OIB. The U concentrations are also relatively high, 
ranging from 0.04 to 0.78 ppm. Th/U ratios are 
fairly constant (3.09-3.55) and, as a whole, are 
substantially higher than most N-MORB (2-2.7) and 
slightly higher than FAMOUS MORB [28]. Th/U 
ratios in FAZAR glasses do not correlate simply 
with Ba/TiO, ratios or Th concentrations. 
cz3’Th/ 232Th) ratios reported in Table 2 show 
that the samples contain large 230Th excesses ranging 
from N 20% to 35% (Fig. 5). These values are 
broadly similar to the FAMOUS data of Condomines 
et al. [28], and to basalts from Faial, Azores [29].

s stematic relationship between 230Th excess and 
Y 2 4U excess, and we consider that the deviations of 
(234U/ 238U) from unity are probably not significant. 
Seawater alteration of the glasses is not considered, 
therefore, to have perturbed the Th-U systematics. 
6. Discussion 
6.1. The case against assimilation of Z30Th-rich sedi- 
ment as a cause of 230Th excesses at ridges 
Deep-sea sediments and Mn-oxides contain large 
excesses of 230Th that could contaminate MORB 
magmas as they make their way to the surface [30]. 
Recent mass spectrometric measurements of EPR 
MORBs by Goldstein et al. [3 l-331 have shown that 
the process creating the U-Th disequilibrium in 
MORJ3s is happening at the ridge axis because the 
excesses are, in general, not present in basalts 
dredged far off-axis. The 230Th excesses could, in 
theory, however, result from assimilation of Mn- 
oxides by the magma on its way to the surface 
through a kilometer thick pile of altered pillows, or 
through incorporation of sediment into the flow dur- 2.00 ~_. _,.--l .~_ 1 T

ing eruption. This contamination would have to be a 
shallow process because Th is not efficiently carried 
by hydrothermal solutions, unless they are fluoride- 
rich, and the precipitation of Mn oxides, which 
scavenge 230Th from seawater, occurs only at low 
temperature, in a more oxidizing environment. 
There are several tests that can be applied to 
determine whether contamination is a plausible ex- 
planation for the data. First, the curves in Fig. 6

amount of assimilation, the low U concentration 
samples would exhibit larger 230Th excesses. Such a 
trend is not shown by the FAZAR data (Fig. 6). The 
amount of assimilation required to explain the dise- 
quilibrium in the enriched samples would also be 
unreasonably large (> 2%). The within-dredge ho- 
mogeneity of (230Th/232Th) also argues strongly 
against random locally variable assimilation during 
eruption. Finally, (230Th/ 23*U) correlates with axial 
depth (see Fig. 7), and there is no reason why this 
should occur if all of the disequilibrium were to be 
explained by assimilation of Mn-rich sediments. 
Therefore, there is no evidence that assimilation of 
230Th-rich material has influenced the Th-U system- 
atics in the glass samples that we analyzed. 
6.2. Source heterogeneity and U-Th disequilibrium 
230Th and 238 
U are presumed to be in secular 
equilibrium in the mantle source prior to melting. 
During melting, the extent of disequilibrium will 
depend only on D,/D, in the residue. However, 
the modal mineralogy, volatile content, or fertility of 
the source could affect the bulk U-Th partition 
coefficient and, hence, the U-Th systematics in the 
melt [3,34,35]. An enriched source with more abun- 
dant garnet would, for example, have higher 
D”/D,ll. 
Along-axis surveys of the MAR by Schilling et al. 
[ 111 have shown that trace elements document source 
heterogeneities that correlate with axial depth in the 
Azores region. Thus, the relationship between 
(230Th/ 238U) and source chemical and isotopic vari- 
ations needs to be carefully examined. Bourdon et al. 
[36] have shown that there is a general global corre- 
lation between (230Th/ 238U) and Th/U. The 
FAZAR samples occupy the shallow end of this 
array and also have high Th/U relative to other 
MORBs and, thus, we need to consider whether the 
higher than average (230 Th/ 238U) ratios for these 
samples may be explained as a source effect. 
Measured (230Th/ 238U) ratios for the FAZAR 
region, however, do not correlate with trace element 
ratios such as Ba/Th or Ba/TiO,, which are good 
indicators of plume involvement in the source. Simi- 
larly, simple relationships between (230Th/ 23*U) and 
*‘Sr/ 86 Sr, ‘43Nd/ ‘44Nd and ‘06Pb/ 204Pb are not 
observed (L. Dosso, pers. commun.). For example, samples RC46 and RC98, which come from the 
shallowest ridge segment studied (KP-5), have rela- 
tively depleted geochemical signatures (low Ba/Th 
and relatively low Ba/TiO,), but high 
(230Th/ 238U), similar to nearby geochemically en- 
riched samples (e.g., DR17). 
Due to the influence of the Azores plume on the 
MAR in the FAZAR region, systematic relationships 
between melting depth, melting process, and source 
heterogeneity are to be expected. Therefore, some 
degree of correlation between 230Th excess and 
source composition would be expected, even if there 
were no direct causal link between these parameters. 
No such relationship, however, is evident in our 
data. We conclude, therefore, that while it is con- 
ceivable that source enrichment may contribute to 
the generally large excesses of 230Th which charac- 
terize the FAZAR samples, local variations in 
(230Th/ 238U), at the scale of this study, are not 
related to source heterogeneity. 
6.3. The relationship between 230Th-23RU disequilib- 
rium and melting processes 
Since neither assimilation nor source heterogene- 
ity can account for the internal FAZAR 230Th-238U 
systematics, the observed variations are likely to be 
caused by melting processes. In this section, we 
qualitatively evaluate melting parameters, including 
the degree of melting, upwelling velocity, matrix 
porosity and pressure of melting, that may affect 
(230Th/ 238U). In this context, a key observation is 
the correlation between the axial de th of the ridge, a 
geophysical observable, and the P 2 oTh/238U ratios 
(Fig. 7). 
In general, larger degrees of melting, whether 
batch or fractional, will lead to smaller fractionations 
between 230n and 238 
U. As a shallower ridge axis 
should be indicative of hotter mantle and higher 
degrees of melting, one might predict a positive 
correlation of 230 Th excess and axial ridge depth. 
This is the opposite of what we observe at FAZAR 
and, therefore, the degree of melting does not seem 
to exert a primary influence on the degree of Th-U 
disequilibria. 
As shown by McKenzie [2] and others [3,37], 
slow upwelling of source material beneath the ridge 
can lead to large excesses of 230Th, provided that the

Fig. 8. (a) Model curve for (z30Th/23aU) as a function matrix 
upwelling velocity. Increased buoyancy near the hotspot should 
increase the matrix upwelling velocity. Decrease in upwelling near 
segment boundaries could explain the local systematics. In this 
calculation, the initial depth of melting is constant at - 25 kbar, 
and the mantle porosity is 0.3%. (b) Model curve for (“‘Th/ 23sU) 
as a function of solidus depth. The matrix upwelling velocity is 
0.02 m/yr and the porosity is again 0.3%. A - 30-40 km 
variation in solidus depth can possibly explain along-axis varia- 
tions in (230Th/ 23aU) For both model curves, the melting rate is 
- l%/kbar. Bulk partition coefficients for U and Th are 1.9X 
lo-’ and 5.3X 1O-4 for garnet lheaolite, and are taken to 
1 X 10e5 for U and Th in the spine1 lherzolite field to simulate 
melt depletion. The garnet-spine1 lherzolite transition is fixed at 
20 kbar. 
melr velocity is sufficiently rapid. Thus, hotter, more 
active ridge segments would be expected to exhibit 
the smallest (230Th/238U) ratios (see Fig. 8a and 
[2,3,37]) if the magma upwelling rate was indeed a 
controlling factor at FAZAR. This is again the re- 
verse of what we observe and, hence, we may dis- 
count upwelling velocity as being a major factor in 
determining 230Th excesses at FAZAR. 
Another important parameter which arises in vari- ous melting models is the matrix porosity. High 
mantle porosity should be associated with hot re- 
gions characterized by shallow ridge depth and higher 
rates of crustal production. Higher porosity, how- 
ever, would tend to decrease (230Th/ 238U) in the 
melt, which again is the opposite of what we ob- 
serve. Hence, porosity is unlikely to be the main 
controlling factor for (230Th/ 238U) at FAZAR. 
Finally, we need to consider the effect of the 
pressure of intersection of the solidus. When the 
solidus is intersected at greater pressure, the up- 
welling material will begin to melt deeper in the 
mantle. Deeper initiation of melting within the garnet 
peridotite stability field (P > 20 kbar), leads to the 
availability of more time for in-growth of 230Th, 
while 238U is retained relative to Th in the garnet- 
bearing residue 1371. These conditions should also 
ultimately lead to greater melt production, thicker 
crust, shallower ridge depth, and larger extents of 
Th-U disequilibrium. This prediction is consistent 
with the FAZAR data and, thus, provides a qualita- 
tive explanation for correlation between 
(230Th/ 238U) and axial depth. 
Variation in the solidus pressure could also ex- 
plain the U-Th data for Faial and the 30”N MAR 
basalts (Fig. 7), which may be considered as end- 
members for the melting process. Beneath the center 
of the Azores hotspot (Faial), the pressure of inter- 
section of the solidus may be very high, leading to a 
longer residence time in the garnet field, and thus 
producing even larger 230Th excesses than at the 
shallowest ridge (depending on the variation in up- 
welling rates between the hotspot and the ridge). The 
mantle at Faial is overlain by a N 40 km thick 
lithospheric lid, and melt transport through this re- 
gion would have to be fast enough to preserve the 
U-Th disequilibrium. At 30”N, the axial depth is of 
the order of 3000-4000 m and, accordingly, the 
mantle temperature is cooler, and upwelling mantle 
reaches the solidus at a relatively shallow depth. In 
the solidus-pressure model, this should lead to low 
230Th excess and, in fact, this is what we observe 
(Fig. 7). One sample, D12-9 (29”N), even contains 
excess 238U, indicating that melting could have 
started above the garnet/spine1 transition where 
clinopyroxene is the main phase controlling U-Th 
fractionation [38,39]. In this case, D,, > DY and 
melting should lead to excess 238U relative to 3oTh. 
8. Bourdon et af. / Earth and Pfanetmy Science Letters I42 (19%) I75-189 185 
This observation strongly supports the solidus-pres- 
sure model, as no other melting parameter can in- 
duce a reversal in U-Th fractionation. 
In summary, the correlation of U-Th disequilib- 
rium and axial depth at FAZAR is best explained by 
a variation in the solidus pressure along the MAR. 
This variation could be related to an anomalously 
high volatile content of the Azores plume material 
[ 11,40,41], hotter mantle temperature, or a combina- 
tion of the two. An increased presence of fertile 
eclogite in the plume source material could also 
simultaneously increase the solidus depth and the 
interval over which garnet is on the liquidus. In this 
case, however, the eclogite cannot be the main car- 
rier of the plume geochemical signature, because of 
the absence of observed correlations between 
(230Th/ 238U) and other trace element and isotopic 
indices of enrichment. Furthermore, the low Fe con- 
tent of the MORB from near the Azores has been 
used to argue against a more fertile source in this 
region in terms of major elements. Our data does not 
discriminate well between these hypotheses because 
U-Th disequilibrium only reflects the depth at which 
melting begins. We consider it likely that mantle 
temperature and increased volatile content are impor- 
tant and that an enhanced presence of mafic material 
in the source might also reflect, in principle, the 
Th-U data. 
6.4. Quantitative investigation of the model for U-Th 
disequilibrium 
The plausibility of the model proposed above was 
tested by calculating (230Th/238U) as a function of 
the pressure of intersection of the solidus. To do so, 
we used a two-stage, one-dimensional transport 
model [37]. The first stage is in the garnet lherzolite 
field (Dr,,/D,, = 0.28), and the second stage is in 
the spine1 lherzolite field (D,, and D, are both 
small because of melt depletion of the solid). In this 
calculation, the only variable is PO, and all the other 
parameters are held constant (see caption of Fig. 8). 
The matrix porosity is essentially a free parameter, 
and a value of 0.3% gives a range in (230Th/ 238U) 
that closely matches the range obtained for the 
FAZAR samples. The increase in solidus pressure 
necessary to obtain the observed range in 
(230Th/238U) is about 10 kbar, which places the highest pressure for the onset of melting at - 30-35 
kbar (Fig. 8b). This would correspond to an increase 
in temperature, relative to the ambient mantle, of 
about - 100°C. The mantle temperature derived from 
our model is in reasonable agreement with the esti- 
mate based on gravity data (75”C, Cochran and 
Talwani [8]) and is also consistent with the range of 
regional depth of 1500 m for the Azores, if the total 
range in ridge axial depth (o-5000 m) reflects a 
250°C change in mantle temperature. This estimate is 
lower than the estimate (AT = 200°C) given by 
Schilling [42], which would lead to a crustal thick- 
ness greatly in excess of that deduced from seismic 
observations ( - 11 km). 
Assuming, then, a melt productivity of = 
l%/kbar, the axial depth of the ridge can be mod- 
elled for different pressures of intersection of the 
solidus. We have used the isostatic model of Klein 
and Langmuir [26] with a compensation depth of 200 
km. The crustal thicknesses obtained with this model 
are consistent with the maximum crustal thickness 
determined seismically for the Azores plateau. The 
curve shown in Fig. 7 is the result of this parameteri- 
zation of axial depth and (230Th/ 238U) as a function 
of P,,, and is consistent with the trend shown by the 
data. 
There is, however, a discrepancy in detail be- 
tween the crustal thickness estimated by Detrick et 
al. [5] and that inferred from the Th-U disequihb- 
rium data. The interpretation of gravity data suggests 
that the crust is thicker beneath segment KP-2 and 
KP-3, while Th-U would be consistent with thicker 
crust at segment KP-5. There might be several rea- 
sons for this discrepancy. Segments KP-4 and KP-5 
are more inflated and may be in a constructional 
phase. The U-series data reflects the instantaneous 
state of the melting region, while gravity is averaged 
over a long length scale. The determination of crustal 
thickness by gravity tacitly assumes that the mantle 
densities are constant. As mentioned earlier, the 
Azores region is characterized by an iron depletion. 
As shown in Fig. 2, segments KP-2 and KP-3 have 
lower Fe,, content than adjacent segments. If these 
segments were truly characterized by thicker crust, 
one would expect them to have a higher mean 
pressure of melting and, hence, higher Fe,.,. This 
apparent contradiction can be resolved if these seg- 
ments are depleted in Fe, which would produce a 
186 3. Bourdon et al. /Earth and Planetary Science Letters 142 (1996) 175- I89 
lower density in the underlying mantle. This would 
result in an overestimation of the crustal thickness 
using the gravity method and may help explain the 
discrepancy between the U-Th disequilibria and the 
gravity data modelling. 
6.5. Segment-scale systematics 
There is a significant dispersion in the 230Th 
excess versus axial depth correlation (Fig. 7). 
(230Th/23*U) and axial depth are shown as a func- 
tion of latitude in Fig. 9. Here it can be seen that 
230Th excesses diminish at segment boundaries, 
where the bathymetry is also deeper. We consider 
four possible explanations for this observation: 
(1) Samples recovered from segment boundaries 
were not as fresh as those collected within segments. 
It has been suggested, based on the morphology and 
tectonics of slow-spreading ridges, that the magma 
supply near segment boundaries is less robust. Thus, 
a simple explanation for the lower (230Th/ 238U) 
ratios near segment boundaries is that samples are

Vertical lines represent segment boundaries. on average older by about 20 kyr, as a consequence 
of the lower frequency of magma injections. 
(2) It has been proposed that the central regions of 
segments are characterized by more buoyant up- 
welling and hotter mantle temperatures [23,43]. This 
would lead to a higher pressure of intersection of the 
solidus within segments than at segment boundaries. 
This is possible only if significant horizontal thermal 
gradients ( > 7”K/ 10 km) can be maintained during 
upwelling of the mantle, which may be difficult due 
to relatively high rates of thermal diffusion. A greater 
volatile content that would lead to deeper initiation 
of melting is another possibility for explaining the 
within segment variability. 
(3) Upwelling velocity may vary near segment 
offsets (20-50 km) as a consequence of near-surface 
cooling due to adjacent older plates [23,43-47) The 
model of Sparks et al. [45] predicts, for example, 
variations in upwelling rates of up to 60% near a 
transform zone. A reduction in matrix velocity can 
produce either larger or smaller 230Th excesses de- 
pending on the absolute value of the matrix velocity 
(Fig. 8a) [37]. If th e matrix upwelling velocity were 
less than 0.01 m/yr, then a further reduction of 
30-40% could explain the variations in excess 230Th 
observed at segment boundaries. This hypothesis is 
consistent with diapiric models for slow spreading 
ridge segments [23,43,47]. 
(4) Melt at segment boundaries may have a longer 
residence time in the shallow upper mantle; transport 
through the lithosphere could also be slower. In this ^ 
case, decay of “‘Th would

7. Summary and conclusions 
U-Th data for basaltic glasses from 40”30’N to 
37”30’N are characterized by large (230Th/238U) 
ratios (1.20- 1.35) that cannot be attributed to assimi- 
lation of sediment or Mn-oxide coated surfaces. 
Major elements, trace elements and Sr, Nd and Pb 
isotopes suggest large variations in mantle source 
composition for this portion of the Mid-Atlantic 
Ridge. While from this data set alone we cannot rule 
out the possibility the high mean level of 230Th 
excess may be responding to more garnet in the 
mantle source of this region, the internal variations 

3. Bourdon et al./ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 142 (19%) 175-189 187 
for this sample suite seem independent of these 
compositional variations. 
(230Th/ 238U) ratios in FAZAR glasses correlate 
with the axial depth of the ridge, with the greatest 
excesses of 230Th observed at the shallowest ridge 
segments. These data can be explained qualitatively 
and quantitatively by variations in solidus pressure 
resulting from hotter mantle temperatures and/or 
higher source volatile content near the Azores plume. 
Our model-dependent estimate for the variation in 
solidus pressure is - 10 kbar over about 300 km of 
ridge. This would place the initial pressure of melt- 
ing beneath the shallowest portion of ridge at 30-35 
kbar, consistent with an inferred crustal thickness of 
10-11 km. 
The solidus-pressure model is consistent with the 
association of thick crust with lighter (hotter) mantle 
and bathymetric highs, as has been proposed based 
on major element systematics along normal ridge 
segments [27]. We note, however, that, in the context 
of the major element approach, the Azores region is 
considered to be anomalous because of the evidence 
for major and trace element heterogeneity. The Th-U 
disequilibrium approach, however, is less sensitive to 
major element source heterogeneity, and thus permits 
an investigation of melting systematics even in this 
anomalous region. 
In the FAZAR region, 230Th excesses are rela- 
tively smaller at segment ends. A reduction in mantle 
upwelling velocity or slow melt transport near the 
boundaries may account for these observations. Al- 
ternatively, the smaller (230Th/ 238U) could reflect 
an older age of the lavas at segment boundaries. 
More data will be needed to confirm the frame- 
work for interpretation that our data provides. Exten- 
sion of U-Th studies to other ridges, where spread- 
ing rates, degrees of melting, and axia1 depths are 
different, will help us to understand more clearly the 
relationship between variation in melting parameters 
and 230Th excesses.
