Abstract 
A series of primary amido gallium alkyl complexes that includes a base free dimer, [‘Bu,Ga( CL-N(H)‘Bu)], (1). Lewis base stabilized 
monomeric complexes, “BuzGa(N(H)‘Bu)(THF) (2) and “Bu,Ga[NH(2,6-Me&H&y (3) and an anionic complex, “Bu,GdNH(2,6- 
Me,C,H,)],[Li(Et,O)] (4) is reported. Complex 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group f-l (a = 10.265(5) A, b = 1X752(6) A, 
c = 8.932(4) A, (Y - 90.32(3)“, p = 105.61(3)“, y= 88.24(4)“) with two molecules, each residing on an inversion center, in the 
asymmetric unit. Structural analysis revealed a planar Ga,N, core with both the bridging N and the Ga centers in distorted tetrahedral 
environments (Ga-C distances 2.052(3)-2.065(3) A and Ga-N distances 2&o(3)-2.069(3) A). The use of excess amido ligand allowed 
the isolation ant crystallization of 4. Complex 4 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/n (a = 8.666(2) A, b = 22.305(3) A, 
c = 15.570(3) A, p = 103.4$2)) with Z = 4. Th e

2.006(7) A), and two “Bu ligands (Ga-Cl7 - 2.002(9) A, Ga-C21 = 1.985(12) A). A bridging 
interaction of the lithium cation with the lone pair of electrons on each of amide nitrogen atoms generates a molecular core which is made 
up of a planar Ga-Nl-Li-N2 distorted square (Nl-Gal-N2 94.4”, Gal-N2-Lil 86.2”. Nl-Lil-N2 92.2”, Gal-Nl-Lil 87.1”).

1. Introduction 
The motivation for preparation of compounds con- 
taining gallium and indium in combination with Group 
15 elements (N, P, As) stems largely from the appear- 
ance of these elements in a variety of electronic materi- 
als. For example, the current method for preparation of 
GaN films, a potentially important wide band-gap semi- 
conductor, relies on the reaction of trialkyl gallium with 
ammonia to eliminate three equivalents of alkane and 
form the solid film [l-3]. In addition, primary amido 
complexes of aluminum and gallium have received 
recent attention as potential sources of imido alanes and 
gallanes via elimination of alkanes [4-l l]. The ten- 
dency of Group 13 amido complexes to oligomerize and 
thus increase the coordination of both the metal and the 
nitrogen has been observed for both aluminum and 
gallium and is expected to also manifest itself for imido 
complexes of these metals. The aggregation of these 
??Corresponding author. species may divulge useful information about the mech- 
anism and formation of GaN from molecular precursors. 
With these facts in mind, we have focused on the 
preparation of alkyl gallium amido compounds bearing 
primary amido groups. Since steric effects are likely to 
play an important role in the level of aggregation of 
these species, we have chosen both alkyl groups (“Bu 
and ‘Bu) and amido groups (‘BuNH and [2,6- 
Me,C,H,]NH) of intermediate steric bulk. We report 
the synthesis and characterization of a series of primary 
amido gallium alkyl complexes that includes a base free 
dimer, [‘Bu,Ga( E.L-N(H)‘Bu)], (11, Lewis base stabi- 
lized monomeric complexes, ” Bu ,Ga(N(H)‘Bu)(THF) 
(2) and “Bu,Ga[NH(2,6-Me,C,H,)lpy (3), and an an- 
ionic complex, “Bu,Ga(NH(2,6-Me,C,HJ]JLi(Et,O)] 
(4). 
In an effort to control the product distribution, our 
synthetic strategy is based on the metathetical reaction 
of R,GaCl precursors with the lithium salt of primary 
amines rather than the direct reaction of gallium alkyls 
with amines [3-91. Thus, the reaction of ‘Bu,GaCl [12] 
and LiN(H)‘Bu resulted in the isolation of 1 as colorless

and it confirmed the dimeric nature of this primary 
amido-bridged complex: [ ‘Bu,Ga( E.L-N(H)’ Bu)], (Fig. 
1). The complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group 
P-l with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and no 
anomolously short intermolecular contacts. Selected 
bond distances and angles for the two molecules are 
presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The structural 
analysis revealed a planar Ga,N, core, with each of the 
molecules residing on an inversion center. The angles 
within this core are quite strained. For example, the 
angle Nl-Gal-NlA is 81.7” and that for Gal-Nl- 
GalA is 98.3” (the sum of the internal angles for both 
molecules is 360”). Both the bridging N and the Ga’ 
centers are in distorted tetrahedral environments with a 
range of bond angles. The structural paraOmeters includ- 
ing Ga-C (range = 2.052(3t-2.065(3) A) and Ga-N 
(range = 2.060(3)-2.069(3) A) distances are in accord

with those observed for similar compounds in the litera-

A similar reaction of “Bu,GaCl [13] and LiN(H)‘Bu 
gave an oily, non-crystalline solid. This material could 
be crystallized as colorless crystals in approximately 
40% overall yield through the addition of coordinating 
species, such as THF, to yield a monomeric primary 
amido dialkyl species, “Bu,Ga(N(H)‘Bu)(THF) (2) 
(Scheme 1). Spectral features, including ‘H and 13C 
NMR spectra, and elemental analysis confirmed the

formulation of 2. Complex 2 can be sublimed under oil 
pump vacuum at 90 “C. 
Similarly, attempts to make a Lewis base-free com- 
plex from the reaction of “Bu,GaCl and Li[N(H)(2,6- 
C,H,Me,)] were unsuccessful, yielding only oily in- 
tractable materials. Addition of pyridine did not facili- 
tate the crystallization of this material but did allow the 
isolation of an oil that was confirmed by spectroscopic 
characterization and microanalysis to be *Bu,Ga 
[NH(2,6-C,H,Me,)]py (3) (Scheme 1). Preliminary at- 
tempts to prepare {‘Bu2Ga[NH(2,6-Me,C,H,)]}, have 
been unsuccessful, even with the addition of coordinat- 
ing ligands such as THF and pyridine. 
The use of excess anionic ligands also allowed the 
isolation and crystallization of alkyl amido complexes 
from the oily materials produced from the 1: 1 reaction 
of “Bu,GaCl and lithium amide. For example, the 
interaction of {“Bu,Ga[NH(2,6-Me,C,H,)]], with an 
additional equivalent of LiN(H)(2,6-C,H s Me, > pro- 
duced “Bu,Ga[NH(2,6-Me,C,H,)1,[Li(Et,O)] (4) 
(Scheme 1). Structural characterization by single crystal 
X-ray diffraction confirmed the molecular connectivity 
of this complex [15]. Complex 4 crystallized in the 
monoclinic space group P21/n with 2 = 4. As shown 
in Fig. 2, the structure consists of a gallium center in a 
pseudotetrahedral coordination sphere composed of two amido ligands (Ga-Nl = 2.011(8) A, Ga-N2 = 
2.006(7) A), and two “Bu ligands (Ga-Cl7 = 2.002(g) 
A, Ga-C21 = 1.985(12) A>. A bridging interaction of 
the lithium cation with the lone pair of electrons on 
each of amido nitrogen atoms generates a molecular 
core which is made up of a planar Ga-NI-Li-N2 
distorted square (Nl-Gal-N2 94.4”, Gal-N2-Lil 
86.2”, Nl-Lil-N2 92.2”, Gal-Nl-Lil 87.1). Addi- 
tional selected bond distances and angles for 4 are given 
in Tables 1 and 2. Consistent with the spectroscopic 
data is the presence of one diethyl ether ligand complet- 
ing the unusual, distorted trigonal planar coordination of 
the Li cation. 
We have reported the synthesis of four new dialkyl 
primary amido complexes of gallium. Two of these 
compounds, a dimeric species (1) and a monomeric 
dialkyl diamido gallate complex (41, have been struc- 
turally characterized. Thermal studies of these and anal- 
ogous complexes are currently underway.

2.8. X-Ray crystallography 
Acknowledgments 
Intensity data were collected on a Rigaku diffrac- 
tometer at - 110 “C using the w-2 8 scan technique to a 
maximum 26 value of 49.8” (complex 1) and 50” 
(complex 2) for crystals mounted on glass fibers. Cell 
constants and orientation matrices were obtained from 
the least-squares refinement of 24 or 25 carefully cen- 
tered high-angle reflections. Redundant reflections were 
removed from the data set. The intensities of three 
representative reflections were measured after every 150 
reflections to monitor the crystal and instrument stabil- 
ity. Data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization 
effects but not for absorption. The structures were solved 
by direct methods. The non-hydrogen atoms were re- 
fined anisotropically. Hydrogen atom positions were 
located in the difference Fourier maps and refined 
isotropically in the case of favorable observation/ 
parameter ratio. The final cycle of full-matrix least 
squares refinement was based on the number of ob- 
served reflections with (I > 2.5a(I)). In the case of 
complex 2 there was disorder for one of the n-butyl 
chains bound to gallium. The chain was disordered over 
two positions. Anomalous dispersion effects were in- 
cluded in the Fcalc. All calculations were performed 
using the NRCVAX package. Details of the data collec- 
tion, refinement and final atomic coordinates are re- 
ported in the Supplementary Materials. This work was supported by the Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
