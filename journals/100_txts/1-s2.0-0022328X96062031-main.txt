Abstract 
Two related sodium amide complexes derived from secondary amines with bulky organic substituents have been synthesised and 
crystallographically characterised. Both [(‘Pr),NNa(TMEDA)12 and [Cy(‘Pr)NNa(TMEDA)], adopt dimeric crystal structures with a 
central, planar (nitrogen-metal), azametallocycle, a now familiar feature in both lithium amide and sodium amide chemistry. TMEDA 
ligands chelate in their usual bidentate manner making the Na+ cations four-coordinate with a distorted tetrahedral geometry. In the latter 
complex, the amido substituents are disposed in a trans conformation with respect to the (NNa), ring plane. The deprotonating ability of 
the former complex has been tested against that of the parent amide [(‘Pr),NNal, and the lithium congener [(‘Pr),NLi], (LDA) in a series 
of simple organic reactions: selective enolate formation from 2-octanone and 2-methylcyclohexanone; synthesis of diphenylacetic acid via 
diphenylmethane. In general, the performance of the sodium reagents compares favourably with that of the lithium reagent.

1. Introduction 
During the past 15 years there has been quite a 
significant growth in the structural characterisation of 
crystalline lithium amides. This reflects their extensive 
use as synthetic reagents and also the importance of 
understanding their structures as a guide to explaining 
their reactivity and selectivity [l]. 
Hindered lithium amides [RR’NLi(L),], can have 
certain advantages over the more conventional alkyl- 
lithium reagents such as BuLi or MeLi when utilised in 
proton abstraction reactions. They can react in a highly 
regio- and stereospecific manner and their high basicity 
and low nucleophilicity make them particularly useful 
in reactions with organic substrates containing carbonyl 
or other such unsaturated functional groups [2]. The 
most widely utilised reagent in this respect is lithium

sive, a good deal of information now exists on both its 
solution [3] and solid state structures [4]. When not 
complexed by Lewis base donor molecules it exists in 
the solid state as a helical polymer [5], although it has 
previously been described in solution as being in the 
form of various cyclic oligomers. On complexation with 
TMEDA (N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine) it 
crystallises as the polymer {[(iPr),NLi],(TMEDA)X, [6], 
and with THF as the dimer [(‘Pr>,NLi(THF)], [7]. LDA 
has also been characterised in the solid state within 
mixed-anion species, e.g. {[(‘Pr>,NLi],LiCl(TMEDA),)

In this paper, we report the first crystal structure of a 
sodium diisopropylamide (NDA) complex, [( ‘Pr),NNa- 
(TMEDA)], 1, along with the closely related structure 
of the isopropylcyclohexylamide [Cy( i Pr)NNa(TM- 
EDA)], 2. Such heavier alkali metal amides potentially 
offer enhanced reactivity over their lithium counterparts 
in proton abstraction applications, though this may be 
achieved with a loss in selectivity. In order to explore

this possibility we have performed studies measuring 
the relative performance of lithium and sodium diiso- 
propylamides in simple reactions reported by Corey and 
Gross [9] and Brandsma [IO] involving selective enolate 
formation, and also in the metallation of diphenylamine. 
2. Sodium amide complexes 1 and 2 
2.1. Results and discussion 
The two methods which we utilised in the synthesis 
of the sodium amides are represented schematically in 
Eqs. (11, (2) and (3): 
“BuLi + NaO’Bu * “BuNa 1 + LiO’Bu (1) 
i = hexane 
ii = 0°C + 25”C, 7 h 
“BuNa + RR’NH i, [RR’NNa(L),] n (2) 
i = hydrocarbon solvent, e.g. pentane, hexane, cyclo- 
hexane, heptane 
ii = Lewis base(s), (L) 
Reaction temperature variable 
RR’NH + Na( disp) s [RR’NNa(L) k] n (3) 
i = toluene or octane 
ii = Lewis base(s), (L) 
iii = 25°C 
The first method involved the reaction of the pre-dried 
amine with freshly prepared “BuNa in hexane or cyclo- 
hexane followed by the addition of a stoichiometric 
amount of an appropriate Lewis base (Eq. (2)). The 
“BuNa was prepared beforehand from the transmetalla- 
tion reaction of commercially available “BuLi with 
NaO’Bu in hexane (Eq. (1)). The resultant powder, 
which is highly pyrophoric when dry, was isolated, 
washed with hexane and stored under argon in a glove 
box. Unfortunately, ” BuNa metallates toluene easily and 
is insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents, however, it is 
reactive enough to deprotonate most secondary or pri- 
mary amines in a hexane medium, quickly if the amine 
is in solution and more slowly if it is a solid. As is 
found for many sodium amide complexes, a non-polar 
hydrocarbon solvent was sufficient, with gentle heating, 
to ensure complete dissolution of complexes 1 and 2. 
When this is not the case, then further amounts of polar 
solvents, e.g. THF, have to be added but, owing to the 
high reactivity of “BuNa, it is advisable that this is done 
only after metallation of the amine has occurred. The 
second procedure uses elemental sodium in the metalla- 
tion of the amine (Eq. (3)), as reported in an earlier 
communication [ 111. Under normal circumstances this 
reaction is very slow or ineffective. However, in the 
presence of one equivalent of an electron carrier such as isoprene the reaction proceeds efficiently, with or with- 
out the presence of a Lewis base. We found the opti- 
mum Na dispersion : amine : isoprene ratio to be 1 : 1 : 0.5 
and also that the electron carriers styrene, biphenyl and 
naphthalene were less effective in the preparation of 1. 
Both procedures have proved to be highly effective in 
the synthesis and isolation of microcrystalline or crys- 
talline products in high yield. 
Crystals of both 1 and 2 were grown from hexane 
solutions at ambient temperature (approximately 21”(Z), 
1 as pale red needles and 2 as pale pink blocks. The 
first batch yield of 1 is relatively low at only 31%; this 
is not the result of it being a minor solution product nor 
is it representative of a high degree of solubility, since 
the microcrystalline product can be extracted at ambient 
temperature in high yield, usually in the region of 80%. 
The difficulty therefore was in maintaining the complex 
in solution long enough so that crystals suitable for 
X-ray analysis could be grown. NDA will also dissolve 
in other Lewis bases such as PMDETA (N,N,N’,N’,N”- 
pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), TEEDA (N,N,N’,N’-te- 
traethylethylenediamine) and DMPU (1,3-dimethyl- 
3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2( 1 H)-pyrimidinone), but attempts at 
crystallisation have thus far been unsuccessful. A high 
yield of crystalline 2 can be obtained by cooling the 
solution slowly in a water bath from a temperature of 
55°C. 
Both complexes are, as expected, highly sensitive to 
air and moisture. However, importantly, they are non- 
pyrophoric and are stable if stored under argon gas for 
periods of at least six months. Unlike 2, which has a 
sharp melting point of 96-97”C, the crystals of 1 melt 
over the range 88-94°C. 
The crystal structures, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, reveal 
that 1 and 2 adopt a structural conformation which has 
been commonly observed not only with lithium amides 
but also, more recently, among sodium amides. Most 
sodium amides structurally characterised to date contain 
the core features adopted by 2 of a central planar 
four-membered (amid0 N-Na), ring with the organic 
substituents extending out from the ring in a transoid

conformation. This structural arrangement clearly re- 
duces any steric interactions between R groups and thus 
aids in the overall stabilisation of the complex. Being 
derived from a homoleptic amine, 1 differs in the fact 
that its R groups are all equivalent (‘Pr). However, the 
central feature remains the planar four-membered ring, 
and it is noticeable from the crystal structure that as a 
means to reduce steric interactions the methyl groups on 
the ‘Pr units stagger themselves in relation to one 
another. Although these details may seem pedantic, the 
one significant departure from this conformational ar- 
rangement, the unusual structure of [PhCH ,(Me)NNa- 
(TMEDA)I, 1121, reminds us that everything is not 
always so simple. Here the organic substituents adopt a 
cis arrangement with an associated buckling of the 
central ring into a butterfly shape (Fig. 3). From MO 
geometrical optimisation calculations at the 6.31 G level 
on the limited model dimer [Me(H)NNa], we have 
found the cisoid form, which shows the accompanying 
ring buckling, to be a less stable structure than that 
represented by 1 and 2 by a mere 0.03 kcal mol- ’

[12b]. Therefore, the structural preference could easily 
be strongly influenced by crystal packing forces. 
The bond lengths and bond angles for 1 and 2 are 
presented in full in Tables 1 and 2 respectively, while 
the bond lengths within the amido N-Na rings them- 
selves are shown for comparative purposes alongside 
those of other characterised sodium amides in Table 3. 
In both 1 and 2 the planar rings are almost symmetrical. 
The raage of amido N-Na bondolengths in 1 is only 
0.012 A, and in 2 only 0.005 A. Also, the sodium 
88 P.C. Andrew et ul. /Journul of Organomrtullic Chemistry 518 (1996) 85-95 
cations in both complexes are four-coordinate, bonding 
with the two N donor atoms offered by the bidentate 
TMEDA ligand as well as the two amido Ns. Although 
four is the most commonly found numerical coordina- 
tion environment for Li+ (generally with a distorted 
tetrahedral geometry), it normally only occurs with 
sodium in the absence of sufficient coordinating Lewis 
base(s) or where there is no opportunity for the metal to 
form internal secondary bonds, i.e. additional in- 
tramolecular interactions with the ligand. It is recog- 
nised, however, that these highly ionic centres will seek 
to associate electrostatically with other dimeric units or 
with donor molecules unless this is precluded by steric 
effects. In general, alkali metal amides tend to associate 
laterally as ladders and many examples can be found for 
lithium amides [23]. Such ladder motifs are also known 
to exist in potassium chemistry [24]. Despite the close 
similarity between lithium and sodium structures, there 
is only one documented case of a sodium amide ladder, 
that of the polymeric 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1 -sodiopyrrole 
[25], excluding the intermetallic ladder [(LiNa[N(CH,- 
Ph),],(OEt),),] [26] which is a special case containing 
a mixture of Lit and Na+ cations. Some of the most 
salient examples of electrostatic association in sodium 
amide chemistry are the extended aggregated structures 
of [(Me,N),,Na,o(TMEDA),], [(Me,N),,Na,,- 
CT’MEDAL,I and [(Me,N),,Na,,(TMEDA),-(CH,C,H,- 
Me),] [22], which unexpectedly contain stacking of 
(NNa), ring units. In alkali metal structural chemistry 
‘ring stacking’ is defined as the face-to-face association 
of (MN), rings, while ‘ring laddering’ is edge-to-edge 
association. It is obviously the relatively small size of 
the Me,N moieties (the smallest diorgano amido group 
possible) which allows the dimeric units to aggregate to 
such a high degree, and it is that coupled with the 
increase in metal ion size in going from Li+ to Na+ 
which causes the mode of association to switch from 
laddering (as in the Li+ case> to stacking. For 1 and 2, 
therefore, we can only assume that with the Na+ held in 
a relatively low coordinate environment further associa- 
tion is sterically prohibited. Increasing the amount of 
TMEDA available for chelation in the solution had no 
effect on the solid state structure formed. Sodium, as a 
result of the size of its larger ionic radius, does, how- 
ever, have a greater tendency in comparison with lithium 
to form complexes in which it is five- or six-coordinate 
if there is opportunity for it to do so. Coupled with 
increased coordination at the metal centre is the increas- 
ing amido N-Na bond lengths, as quite clearly seen 
from Table 3. 
The four-coordination state in 1 and 2 forces the 
local geometry at Na+ to be distorted tetrahedral with 
angles far from the ideal value of 109.5”. The amido N 
atoms are also approximately tetrahedral, the largest 
distortion being in the small Na-N-Na angles. Very 
similar geometries are found in both structures. Indeed, the two molecules are essentially identical except for 
the replacement of the two ‘Pr groups in 1 by two 
cyclohexyl groups in 2, even to the extent of the 
orientations of the substituent groups. 
If we now look at the chelate bonding it can be seen 
that the array of Na-TMEDA bond distances in 1 and 
2, shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively, is not unusual 
(cf. that in [Me(2-Pyr>NNa(TMEDA>1,, 2.5 11 and 2.5 10 
4, and in [(PhCH,),NNa(TMEDA)], , 2.496 and 2.5 11 
A). What is unusual, however, and this at first might 
seem surprising, is the manner in which the TMEDA 
bonds with the metal centres, particularly in the case of 
NDA. The literature contains many examples of ‘nor- 
mal’ bidentate TMEDA -+ M’ bonding, that is with the 
two N atoms donating to a single metal centre, and it 
would not be an unreasonable assumption to view this 
as a universal trend. However, an examination of the 
solution and solid state structural behaviour of the 
TMEDA complexes of LDA reveals that the chelation 
here is not the norm. Firstly, the helical polymer of

crystalline solvent-free LDA is grown from a solution 
mixture in which two equivalents of TMEDA are avail- 
able to each metal centre. That no measurable coordina- 
tion of the Lif by TMEDA occurs is unexpected and 
unusual. However, an LDA complex with TMEDA, 
grown under different conditions, has been structurally 
characterised and is also shown to be a polymer, on this 
occasion though the TMEDA bridges two metal centres 
in a stretched monodentate manner to give an infinite 
chain-like structure of linked dimers [6]. This work has 
also suggested that in solution, in the presence of a 
relatively high concentration of TMEDA, a dimeric 
structure can be formed, but is only facile at tempera- 
tures below -90°C. However, this dimeric structure is 
not one which resembles complex 1, but in fact is one 
in which Li+ is three-coordinate and only bonding with 
one of the two N donor atoms in each TMEDA molecule. 
A possible explanation for the differences centres upon 
the relative size of Na+ in comparison with Lif. The 
larger sodium cation can allow for full incorporation of 
the TMEDA molecule into the dimeric system, while 
the smaller size of the lithium cation probably exacer- 
bates steric repulsions between the ‘Pr groups and the 
Me groups on the TMEDA molecule. To alleviate steric 
stress Li+ relinquishes a possible four-coordination en- 
vironment by only bonding with one of the N donor 
atoms, the other remaining essentially free. 
The reluctance with which LDA bonds with TMEDA 
is also reflected in the solution behaviour of NDA. An 
examination of the chemical shifts of the protons within 
TMEDA reveals that in benzene-d, at room temperature 
NDA is desolvated, the ethylene protons of TMEDA appearing at a higher frequency (6 2.13) than the 
methyl protons (6 2.08). When TMEDA remains com- 
plexed this situation is reversed, as is the case for 2 
(4 X Me at 6 2.06, 2 X CH, at 6 2.01) even in the 
presence of THF which might be expected to aid desol- 
vation of the amide by TMEDA. Presently, the exact 
nature of the solution state species of 1 is unknown, but 
it is most likely that the NDA is partially complexed, 
although we have as yet no spectroscopic evidence for 
this, or that cyclic or laddered oligomers are formed. It 
was also noted from the solution NMR studies that the 
crystal lattices of the two complexes sometimes trapped 
an amount of unreacted or excess amine. The amount 
trapped was variable and inconsistent: for 1 this aver- 
aged about 12% (highest 50%) and for 2 the highest 
found was 20%, though these molecules were not seen 
in the X-ray diffraction studies. Comparing the chemi- 
cal shifts of the trapped diisopropylamine (DPA) in the 
NDA complex with that in the lattice of LDA a signifi- 
cant difference is apparent. Free DPA has the signals 
for Me at 6 0.96 and CH at 6 2.85. The DPA 
entrained in the LDA lattice is consistent with this (6 
0.94 and 2.85 respectively). However, in the NDA case 
the methyne signal is shifted slightly to 6 2.76 (Me at 6 
0.95). Also, the broad NH resonance, which in free 
DPA comes at 6 0.62, moves significantly to the higher 
frequency value of 6 1.41. These observations could 
suggest that the DPA is not truly ‘free’ in the 
NDA/TMEDA solution, but that it interacts with the 
Na+ cation. One clear example of this is the crystal 
structure of the lithium imide, [Li(cyclohexanone 
phenylimine). diisopropylamine], , in which ci Pr), NH

acts as Lewis base, donating into the metal centre [27]. 
Also, mixed complexes where the alkali metal is ligated 
by both the anion and its protonated counterpart have 
been structurally characterised, e.g. a lithium piperi- 
dide/piperidine composition [28] and a sodium ke- 
timide/ketimine composition [29]. Therefore, it is not 
unreasonable to assume that a mixed NDA/DPA com- 
plex is forming in solution here. 
3. Reactivity of NDA 
As noted in the Introduction, LDA is an important 
reagent for organic synthesis, notably as a strong but 
only weakly nucleophilic base. It is commonly prepared 
by the reaction of “BuLi with diisopropylamine, often 
in a medium containing THF, and used in situ. How- 
ever, it cleaves THF fairly rapidly, though methods 
have been devised for preparing and storing it in hydro- 
carbon-THF mixtures, in which it is more stable. NDA 
might differ from LDA in its reactivity, and even if its 
reactivity were similar, it could be an attractive altema- 
tive reagent. We have therefore carried out some experi- 
ments designed to compare LDA and NDA. Like LDA, 
NDA cleaves THF fairly rapidly. Its decomposition in 
THF-d, was monitored by NMR, giving a rough esti- 
mate of the half-life of ca. 0.9 M NDA in THF-d, at the 
probe temperature as ca. 11 h, and in a THF-d,-hexane 
mixture as ca. 3.5 days. Alternatively, solid, unsolvated 
NDA is readily prepared [ 1 I], and appeared to be 
thermally stable. Our experiments were therefore also 
designed to test whether the reagent could be stored for 
long periods. 
3.1. Metallation of diphenylmethane 
The metallation of diphenylmethane was easily moni- 
tored by reaction of the deprotonated species with car- 
bon dioxide to give diphenylacetate, which on acidifica- 
tion gives crystalline diphenylacetic acid:

The results of these studies are summarised in Table 4. 
Note that in this case the comparison could be extended 
to include butyllithium. 
Clearly, the performance of NDA is better than that 
of LDA over this two-step process, and comparable Table 4

with that achieved by butyllithium. Moreover, the solid 
NDA shows only a slow loss of reactivity on storage for 
over a month. NDA(TMEDA) is even more reactive 
than NDA, and also loses reactivity only slowly on 
storage. Similar experiments with other sodium amides 
(sodium dicyclohexylamide and sodium 2,2,6,6-tetra- 
methylpiperidide) indicated that they too were signifi- 
cantly more reactive than LDA, though slightly less 
reactive than NDA or NDA(TMEDA) [30]. 
3.2. Selective enolate formation 
Probably the most important use of LDA is in the 
formation of enolates from carbonyl compounds. It can 
be used at low temperatures, which helps to minimise 
complicating side reactions, and also favours the forma- 
tion of the kinetic product where alternative sites for 
deprotonation are available. To compare NDA with 
LDA we have used methods in which the enolate is 
trapped by chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) as the silyl 
enol ether (SEE). For our experiments using Z-octanone, 
represented by Eq. (51, we used the two-step method of 
House et al. [31] rather than the ‘internal quench’ 
method of Corey and Gross [9], in which the ketone 
reacts with the base in the presence of TMSCl:

The results for the reactions of 2-octanone and 2- 
methylcyclohexanone are set out in Tables 5 and 6. 
The most noteworthy feature of the reactions with 
2-octanone (Table 5) is the high conversion and selec- 
tivity achieved with NDA and NDACTMEDA), even 
with the two-step procedure. With this procedure, House 
et al. [31] obtained high selectivity with LDA, but only 
at ca. 50% conversion; as shown in entry 1 of Table 5, 
high conversion is obtainable, but only at the expense of

selectivity. It should be noted, however, that we have 
confirmed Corey and Gross’s [9] observation that by the 
internal quench procedure both high conversion and 
selectivity are obtainable. The retention of the reactivity 
of NDA on storage was also again demonstrated. The 
reactions with 2-methylcyclohexanone (Table 6) again 
demonstrate that NDA has reactivity and selectivity at 
least as good as that of LDA. 
One possible conclusion that can be drawn from 
these results is that the degree of steric interference 
between the ‘Pr groups and the larger organic groups of 
the ketone is not reduced by the use of a larger metal 
and hence longer M-N bond. Given a transition state of 
the type depicted in Fig. 4 for 2-octanone, we would 
predict that a loss in selectivity would only occur from a 
decrease in steric bulk in the organic portion of the 
metallating species. Thus, [(Me), NNa(L)], would most 
likely have lower selectivity but so also would 
[(Me),NLi(L)],, though probably to a lesser degree 
given the different sizes of the metal cations and M-N 
bonds. 
4. Conclusions 
In reactions where a high degree of reactivity is 
required of the deprotonating/metallating reagent, then 
the use of heavier alkali metal organyls or amides can 
be advantageous. Where the mechanism is kinetically or 
thermodynamically controlled, a loss of selectivity will 
not always necessarily accompany the use of sodium 
rather than lithium complexes. However, it would be a 
mistake to assume that the nature of the metal is not 
important when utilising these reagents; clearly in the 
selective enolate formation at the heart of the discrep- 
ancy between the results for NDA and LDA in the 
two-step reactions must lie the metallic cation. There- 
fore, it would be prudent to isolate and characterise not 
only the metallating reagent itself, for all the reasons 
given in the Introduction, but also the metallated precur- 
sor. That most sodium amides are easily synthesised, 
relatively easy to manipulate and soluble in hydrocar- 
bon solvents in the presence of sufficient coordinating 
donor molecules (normally a stoichiometric amount) 
should allow for further development not only in their

isolation and characterisation but also now in their role 
as important organometallic reagents. A role compara- 
ble perhaps with that now occupied by the commercial 
lithium reagents “BuLi and LDA. 
5. Experimental 
Prior to their usage all solvents and reagents were 
dried. The amines and Lewis bases were distilled and 
stored over 4A molecular sieves. Hexane, cyclohexane 
and THF were dried by reflux over Na wire and de- 
gassed immediately before use. Standard inert atmo- 
sphere and Schlenk techniques were utilised throughout. 
“BuNa was prepared from the reaction of “BuLi and 
Na’BuO ( 1 : 1) in hexane, dried in vacua and stored and 
handled in an argon atmosphere glove box. All NMR 
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX400 and the 
chemical shifts internally referenced and quoted relative 
to 6 0.00 for SiMe,. 
5.1. Synthesis and characterisation of I, [(‘Pr), NNa-

(i) Diisopropylamine (1.31 ml, 10 mmol) was added 
dropwise to a stirred, chilled suspension of “BuNa (0.80 
g, 10 mmol) in 10 ml of hexane. After 10 min stirring 
the reaction was complete and a white precipitate 
formed. Addition of TMEDA (3.02 ml, 20 mmol) fol- 
lowed by gentle heating ensured complete dissolution. 
The pale orange solution was filtered and allowed to 
stand at ambient temperature for 24 h before yielding a 
crop of pale red crystals. The crystals were isolated by 
filtration, washed with hexane and dried in vacua. Yield 
31%. 
(ii) To sodium metal dispersed in toluene or octane 
(74 mmol, 30% w/w) was added, under argon, diiso- 
propylamine ( 105 mmol, 13.8 ml), isoprene ( 105 mmol, 
10.5 ml) and TMEDA (75 mmol, 11.3 ml) in hexane 
(35 ml). The exothermic reaction gradually produced a 
red solution as the sodium metal disappeared. After 
filtration, red crystals were grown at 4°C. Yield 75%.

‘/e4 is defined as one third of the trace of the orthogonalized U,, 
tensor. = 1248, T = 240 K. Measurements were made as for 1 
(20 = 25-40”) for cell refinement, crystal size 0.71 X 
0.63 X 0.27 mm3. The structure was determined and 
refined as above from 3041 independent reflections 
(28,,, = 130”, 4024 reflections measured, Rint = 
0.0858), with weighting parameters a = 0.0907, b = 
2.0114. The molecule lies on a two-fold rotation axis 
passing through both sodium atoms. Extinction parame- 
ter x = 0.00045( 14). R,. = 0.17 15 for all reflections, 
conventional R = 0.0529 for F values of 2073 reflec- 
tions with F,’ > 2~( Fo2); goodness of fit 1.040 for 180 
parameters. All features in a fina: difference synthesis 
lie between +0.35 and -0.25 e Am3. 
For both structures, tables of anisotropic displace- 
ment parameters and hydrogen atom coordinates have 
been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data 
Centre. Non-hydrogen atom coordinates and equivalent 
isotropic displacement parameters for 1 and 2 are given 
in Tables 7 and 8 respectively. 
5.4. Metallation of diphenylmethane 
At room temperature diphenylmethane (3 mmol) was 
added to a solution of the metallating agent (3.3 mmol) 
in cyclohexane (5 ml) and THF (2 ml) (or other solvent 
systems as listed in Table 4). The resulting solution was 
then stirred for 30 min before it was poured onto solid 
CO,, which was then allowed to slowly evaporate. A 
solution of 1 M NaOH was then added, followed by 
Et,O, and the aqueous layer separated and acidified to 
94 P.C. Andrews et al./Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 518 (1996) 85-95 
pH 1. The resulting product was extracted into Et,O, 
dried and concentrated in vacua. The product was 
diphenylacetic acid which was dried and weighed until 
constant weight and melting point. (Literature melting 
point, 148°C). 
5.5. Enolate formation from 2-octanone 
To a solution of the metallating agent (3 mmol) in 
THF (15 ml) at - 78°C was added 2-octanone (2.7 
mmol) and the resulting solution was stirred at this 
temperature for 10 min. TMSCl (3 mmol) was added 
and the solution allowed to warm to room temperature 
and stirred for a further 90 min before being quenched 
with aqueous NaHCO,. It was then extracted with 
hexane and the extract dried over MgSO, and concen- 
trated in vacua. The residue was analysed by GC/MS. 
5.6. Enolate formation from 2-methylcyclohexanone 
2-Methylcyclohexanone (0.98 mmol) was added at 
- 78°C to a THF (10 ml) solution of the metallating 
agent (1 .l mmol). The mixture was then allowed to 
warm slowly to - 50°C at which point TMSCl (1.3 
mmol) was added and the resulting solution again al- 
lowed to warm up slowly until it was at room tempera- 
ture. Diethylamine (0.4 mmol) was added and after 15 
min stirring the reaction mixture was poured into ice 
water and the product extracted into hexane (3 X 15 
ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with 
saturated ammonium chloride solution and dried with 
MgSO,. The silyl enol ether products were concentrated 
in vacua and subsequently analysed by GC/MS. 
5.7. GC/MS details 
A Finnigan ion trap detector interfaced to a Carlo- 
Erba 5300 gas chromatograph was employed to analyse 
all organic products. The following GC/MS conditions 
were used. Column: 30 m PTES 0.32 i.d. capillary 
column. Carrier gas: helium. Oven: 40°C 1 min + 20°C 
min-’ to 250°C hold. Injection: 0.1 ~1 cold on column 
with CH,Cl, as solvent. Retention times: Reaction 5.5, 
2-octanone 287 s, kinetic product 370 s, thermodynamic 
product (Z isomer) 374 s, thermodynamic product (E 
isomer) 383 s; Reaction 5.6, 2-methylcyclohexanone 
254 s, kinetic product 340 s, thermodynamic product 
357 s.
