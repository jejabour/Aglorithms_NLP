Abstract 
By reaction of the hydrazones of mono- and 1,1'-diacetylferrocene with mono- and diketones a series of ferrocenylazines has been 
prepared. The crystal structures of the monobridged ferrocenophane [4](1)(1,4-dimethyl-2,3-diazabuta-1,3-dien) ferrocenophane (II) and 
of the dibridged ferrocenophane [42 ](1, l')bis-(1,4-dimethyl-2,3-diazabuta-1,3-dien) ferrocenophane (VII) have been determined. II exists 
as a centrosymmetric molecule with eclipsed cyclopentadienyl rings and a planar MeC=NN=CMe bridge whereas VII has staggered 
cyclopentadienyl rings and non-planar bridges. In II and VII the bridges are in the E,E configuration. The electrochemical results show 
that the ferrocenium ions of the acetylferrocene and the azines are stable in solution whereas those of the hydrazones are unstable. In 
agreement with a slightly increasing electronic communication between the two ferrocene units, II undergoes two almost overlapping 
one-electron oxidations (AE °' = 0.09 V) whereas VII displays two more widely separated one-electron oxidations (AE °' = 0.12 V). 
Keywords: Iron; Ferrocenyl azines; Ferrocenophane; Crystal structure; Electrochemistry 
1. Introduction 
Ferrocene compounds have aroused much interest 
recently as redox-active entities with potential applica- 
tions in areas such as materials for molecular electronics 
[1] and as biologically active compounds [2]. In these 
contexts there has been considerable interest shown in 
ferrocenylamines and imines as ligands to transition 
metals. As a continuation of our studies on the chem- 
istry of main group element derivatives of ferrocene [3a] 
and their redox behaviour [3b] we have commenced a 
study of some ferrocenylazines. 
We now report high-yielding methods for the synthe- 
sis of the hydrazones of acetyl and 1,1'-diacetylferro- 
cene, the condensation reactions of these hydrazones

phane and [4 2 ](1, l')bis(1,4-dimethyl-2,3-diazabuta- 1,3- 
dien) ferrocenophane, and electrochemical studies of the 
compounds. Very few electrochemical studies have been 
reported for azine-substituted ferrocenes [4,5]. In partic- 
ular, the oxidation process of complexes IV and VII 
unexpectedly displayed ill-shaped responses [6]. 
2. Experimental details 
2.1. General 
All preparations were carried out by standard Schlenk 
techniques [7]. All solvents were freshly distilled, dried 
and degassed before use and all reactions were per- 
formed under purified nitrogen.

Elemental analysis was performed by Butterworth 
Laboratories Ltd., Teddington, Middlesex, UK. ~H and 
13C{IH} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 
AM250 spectrometer operating at 250.13 and 62.90 
MHz respectively. 
Mass spectra were recorded on a Kratos Profile HV3 
instrument. Infrared spectra were recorded on a 
Perkin-Elmer 881 spectrometer. Materials and appara- 
tus for electrochemistry have been previously described

e 7 I - [8]. Potential values are referred to the saturated calomel 
electrode (SCE). 
2.2. Acetylferrocenehydrazone (I) 
A solution of acetylferrocene (1 g, 4.38 mmol) and 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.05 cm 3) in ethanol 
(20 cm 3) was added slowly to hydrazine hydrate (10 
cm 3, 210 mmol) in refluxing ethanol (10 cm3). After 2 
h at reflux the ethanol was evaporated under reduced 
pressure and the product extracted from excess hydra- 
zine with dichloromethane (2 × 30 cm3). Evaporation of 
the dichloromethane at 85°C under reduced pressure 
followed by a crystallisation of the residual solid from 
diethyl ether produced yellow needles (0.99 g, 93%, 
m.p. 115-117°C. Ref. [9] 110-115.5°C). Anal. Found:

2.3. [4](1)(1,4-Dimethyl-2,3-diazabuta-l,3-dien) ferro- 
cenophane (H) 
Concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.075 cm 3) was 
added dropwise to a stirred solution of acetylferrocene 
(4.45 g, 200 mmol) and hydrazine hydrate (20 cm 3) in 
ethanol (100 cm3). The solution was heated under reflux 
for 3 h and then allowed to stand for 2 days. The 
solvent was evaporated at 85°C under reduced pressure 
and the solid residue was washed with pentane (3 x 30 
cm 3) and methanol (25 cm3). A recrystallisation from 
dichloromethane produced red-carmine needles (2.12 g, 
47%, m.p. 216-217°C. Ref. [10] 218-220°C). Anal.

Acetylferrocenehydrazone (0.25 g, 0.1 mmol) in ace- 
tone (15 cm 3) was stirred for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid ex- 
tracted with hexane (2 X 60 cm3). The solvent was 
reduced in volume to approximately 40 cm 3 and the 
product allowed to crystallise as orange-red needles 
(0.22 g, 75%, m.p. 118-120°C). Anal. Found: C, 63.77;

To a solution of 1,1'-diacetylferrocene (0.5 g, 1.89 
retool) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.05 cm 3) in 
ethanol (30 cm 3) at 80°C, hydrazine hydrate (5 cm 3) in 
ethanol (10 cm 3) was added slowly. After 12 h under 
reflux the solvent was evaporated and the solid ex- 
tracted from unreacted hydrazine with dichloromethane 
(2 × 20 era3). The solvent was evaporated under re- 
duced pressure and the product dried in vacuum as an 
orange-red powder (0.43 g, 76%, m.p. 150-152°C).

Concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.15 cm 3) was added 
to a stirred solution of freshly prepared 1,1'-diacetylfer- 
rocenedihydrazone (0.2 g, 0.67 mmol) in ethanol (20 
cm 3) at 80°C. This solution was stirred for 5 rain, the 
solvent was reduced to approximately 15 cm 3 and the 
solution was allowed to stand overnight at room temper- 
ature. A precipitate was separated, washed with ethanol 
(2 cm 3) and then recrystallised from ethanol-hexane to 
produce carmine-red crystals (0.06 g, 17%, m.p. 250- 
253°C). Anal. Found: C, 62.31; H, 5.08; N, 10.00.

2. ~. X-ray structure determinations 
Crystals of compounds II and VII suitable for X-ray 
work were grown from dichloromethane and ethanol- 
hexane respectively. Crystallographic measurements 
were made at 293(2) K on a Delft Instruments FAST 
TV area detector diffractometer positioned at the win- 
dow of a rotating anode generator using Mo K a radia- 
tion (1=-0.71069 A) by following procedures de- 
scribed elsewhere [11]. The structures were solved by 
direct methods (SHELXS86) [12] and difference syntheses, 
and refined by full-matrix least-squares (SnELXL93) [13] 
using all unique Fo 2 data corrected for Lorentz and 
polarisation factors, and also for absorption effects (DIF- 
AUS) [14]. In both cases, the non-hydrogen atoms were 
refined anisotropically; the hydrogen atoms were in- 
cluded in calculated positions (riding model) with Uis o 
refined freely. Compound VII was found to be a racemic 
twin (69/31%); the model presented in the paper repre- 
sents the major component in the crystal as indicated by 
the refinement of the Flack's absolute structure parame- 
ter [15] to 0.31(4). The source of scattering factors was 
Ref. [131. The diagrams were drawn with SNOOPI [161. 
The calculations were done on a 486DX2/66 personal 
computer. The crystal data and details of data collection 
and structure refinement are presented in Table 1. The 
atomic co-ordinates and selected bond lengths and an- 
gles are given in Tables 2-5. Anisotropic displacement 
coefficients, hydrogen atom parameters, and full tables 
of bond lengths and angles, have been deposited at the 
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. 
3. Results and discussion 
Acetylferrocene and 1,1'-diacetylferrocene react with 
hydrazine hydrate in acidified ethanol to produce in 
good yields acetylferrocenehydrazone (I) and 1,1'-di- 
acetylferrocenedihydrazone (IV) respectively. Both compounds are unstable to moisture and slowly decom- 
pose in solution. To convert them to potentially more 
useful materials as ligands they were both subjected to 
condensation reactions with carbonyl compounds. The 
monohydrazone was reacted with acetylferrocene and 
with acetone to produce the azines (II) and (III) respec- 
tively. Compound (II) can also be formed by the direct 
reaction of acetylfen'ocene with hydrazine hydrate. The 
dihydrazone reacted smoothly with the diketones 2,3- 
butanedione and 2,4-pentanedione to form compounds 
(V) and (VI) respectively. No evidence was observed of 
the reactions proceeding further to form ferroceno- 
phanes. Heating the dihydrazone (IV) in ethanol led to 
the formation of the novel ferrocenophane (VII) but in a 
lower yield than when metal salts were employed [6]. 
All the azines are air-stable crystalline solids, they 
exhibit a molecular ion in the mass spectrometer and 
show characteristic C=N vibrations in the infrared. The 
IH and 13C NMR data (Table 6) were consistent with 
the proposed structures. 
To fully characterise the materials, to establish the 
configurations of the bridges, and to enable compm'- 
isons to be made with the structures of related Schiff 
base derivatives of acetylferrocenes, the crystal struc- 
tures were determined of the two ferrocenophanes (II) 
and (VII). After completion of this work we discovered 
that the structure of VlI had been reported [6]. Our cell 
dimensions and space group are the same as those 
reported but our work has identified the fact that the 
crystals are racemic twin. When allowance was made 
for this, the R value obtained was 0.0396 for all unique 
data. In the earlier paper the R value was reported as 
0.067 for data with F o > 4o'(Fo). We suggest that the 
crystal used then was also a racemic twin but it was not 
noted at the time. In view of this we consider it relevant 
to report our work in full. 
The molecular structures of II and VII together with 
the crystallographic atom numbering schemes used are 
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively. Molecules of II are 
strictly centrosymmetric with a pair of (cp)(CsHa)Fe 
moieties bridged by a -C(Me)NN(Me)C- unit. In 
molecules of VII, which are dimeric, two (CsH4)Fe(C 5- 
H a) moieties are bridged by two -C(Me)NN(Me)C- 
units and related by an approximate two-fold axis of 
symmetry. The present study also shows that compound 
VII crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group 
P2~ with molecules of one hand alternating with 
molecules of the other hand in the ratio of 69 : 31. 
The Fe-C distances in both compounds (2.036(4)- 
2.047(4), average 2.040(4) ,~ in II, 2.021(7)-2.072(7), 
average 2.044(7) A in VII) are similar and fall within 
the range commonly found for ferrocene compounds 
[17]. The dimensions of the cyclopentadienyl rings are 
also very similar in the two compounds (C-C distances 
and C-C-C angles: 1.392(7)-1.432(5), average 
1.411(7) ,~ and 107.0(3)-109.1(4), average 108.0(4) °

106.2(5)-109.6(6), average 108.0(6) ° (VII)]. It is inter- 
esting to note that the cyclopentadienyl rings in II are 
eclipsed, whilst in VII they are staggered which is quite 
uncommon in ferrocene compounds. These arrange- 
ments are better illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. 
The cyclopentadienyl rings in both compounds are each 
planar within experimental error; those bonded to the 
same Fe atom are also parallel as indicated by the 
dihedral angles between them 1.3(3) ° (II) and 0.7(5), 
0.9(5) ° (VII). In II, the bridging -CNNC- unit is 
accurately planar with the methyl carbons also lying on 
the plane (within only 0.007(4) A,). In VII, however, 
these units are significantly non-planar with large dis- 
placements of atoms (-0.063 to +0.063(7) A) from

contacts in the molecules. In both compounds, the 
molecules are held together in the crystal by van der 
Waals' forces only. 
Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the cyclic voltammetric 
responses of acetylferrocenehydrazone (I) with the re- 
lated species, acetylferrocene, acetylbenzenehydrazone, 
and the related azine (liD. It can be seen that the 
stability of the ferrocenium forms of acetylferrocene 
and of (lid are considerably greater than that of the 
hydrazone (I) (peaks A,D). We can confidently assign 
peaks B and E to the redox processes of the pendant 
hydrazone group. 
An analysis [18] of the oxidation of acetylfen'ocene 
and of (Ill), with scan rate varying from 0.02 to 10.2 
V s-~ is diagnostic of an essentially electrochemically 
reversible one-electron process (ipc/ipa always unity; 
ipa V-I~2 constant; AEp=75 mV at 0.2 V s-l). In 
contrast to this the first anodic step of (I) is complicated 
by the ensuing chemical reactions in that ipJiva < 1 at 
low scan rates, e.g. 0.4 at 0.2 V s -l, and progressively 
increases with scan rate to reach unity at 10.2 V s -l. 
Assuming a first order chemical reaction results in a 
value of tl/2 = 1 s for the [(I)] + monocation. Similar 
contrasting behaviour is observed for 1,1'-diacetylfer- 
rocene, the dihydrazone (IV) and the azines (V) and 
(VI). The presence of chemical reactions following the 
anodic oxidation of IV has been previously pointed out 
[6], even though the use of a glassy carbon working 
electrode in tetrahydrofuran solution afforded ill-shaped 
responses. In Table 7 the formal redox potentials are 
collected, together with a summary of the results from 
the controlled-potential macroelectrolysis experiments.

by cyclic voltammetric measurements performed on the 
exhaustively oxidised solutions. 
It is readily seen that in the mono- and disubstituted 
ferrocenes, the hydrazone and the azine grouping render 
the oxidation easier than that of the precursor acetyl 
ferrocenes, hence indicating that the electron attracting 
power of the nitrogen-based groups are significantly 
less than that of the acetyl group. In addition it can be 
supposed that for the two acetylferrocenes the normal 
assumption holds that the electron removed on oxida- 
tion is derived from an iron-based HOMO orbital, 
whereas for the other compounds the colour of the 
ferrocenium indicates that the nitrogen-based sub- 
stituents make a significant contribution to the character 
of the orbital. 
In Fig. 6 are shown the cyclic voltammetric re- 
sponses of the two diferrocene complexes (II) and (VII) 
in the anodic region. The monobridged compound (II) 
gives rise to two almost overlapping one-electron oxida- 
tions, whereas (VII) generates two more widely-sep- 
arated one-electron steps. This means that the electronic 
communication between the two ferrocene sub-units is 
rather small in the singly-bridged compound (II) but is 
increased with the addition of the second bridge in 
(VII). Nevertheless, based on the conproportionation 
constant calculated on the basis of the separation be- 
tween the formal electrode potentials (Table 8) of the 
two oxidation processes [19], both cations [II] + (Kco,= 
33) and [VIII + (gco n ~ 100), should belong to the 
'slightly delocalised', class II mixed-valence species, of 
the classification by Robin and Day [20]. Also, in the 
case of complex VII the previously used experimental 
conditions prevented an accurate interpretation of its 
oxidation process [6].
