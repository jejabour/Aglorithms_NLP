Abstract 
Alspach has conjectured that any 2k-regular connected Cayley graph cay(A,S) on a finite 
abelian group A can be decomposed into k hamiltonian cycles. In this paper we generalize 
a result by Kotzig that the Cartesian product of any two cycles can be decomposed into two 
hamiltonian cycles and show that any pseudo-Cartesian product of two cycles can be decom- 
posed into two hamiltonian cycles. By applying that result we first give an alternative proof for 
the main result in (Bermond et al., 1989) including the missing cases, and then we show that the 
conjecture is true for most 6-regular connected Cayley graphs on abelian groups of odd order 
and for some 6-regular connected Cayley graphs on abelian groups of even order. 
1. Introduction 
Let (A, +) be a finite group and S be a subset of A such that O$S and s E S implies 
- s&S. The Cayley graph cay(A,S) is defined to be the graph G with V(G) = A and 
E(G) = {xyIx,y~A, x -yes or y - XES}. We say the edge xy in cay(A,S) is 
generated by SES if x - y = s or y - x = s and the subgraph Q of cay(A,S) is 
generated by s if all edges of Q are generated by s. 
Remark 1.1. From the definition, it is clear that any element of S with order 
2 generates a l-factor of cay(A,S) while any element of S with order at least 
3 generates a 2-factor of cay(A, S). Furthermore, cay(A, S) is connected if and only if 
S generates A. 
It is known that any connected Cayley graph on a finite abelian group is hamil- 
tonian [lo]. In 1984, Alspach [l] conjectured that any 2k-regular connected Cayley

graph on a finite abelian group has a hamiltonian decomposition. Bermond et al. [4] 
proved that every 4-regular connected Cayley graph cay(A,S) on a finite abelian 
group A with 1 Sj = 2 can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. Liu [S] showed 
that the conjecture is true provided that either cay(A,S) is 2m-regular and 
S = {Si,SZ, . . . ,sk} is a generating set of A such that gcd(ord(s;), ord(sj)) = 1 for i # j 
orS = {s1,sz,s3} is a minimal generating set of A with 1 A 1 odd. In [9], Liu has proved 
that cay(A, S) can be decomposed into k hamiltonian cycles if S = {si, s2, . . . , sk} is 
a minimal generating set of an abelian group A of odd order. Here we first show that 
the pseudo-Cartesian product of two cycles can be decomposed into two hamiltonian 
cycles in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we focus on 6-regular connected Cayley graphs 
and extend the conjecture to cay(A, S), where either (i) A is an abelian group of odd 
order and S = {si, s2, sj} is a generating set of A with ord(s,) 3 ord(s,) > ord(s,) or 
(ii) A is a finite abelian group and S = {sr ,s2,s3} is a generating set of A such that 
S has an element si of odd order and for J = (si), A, = A/J has at least nine elements 
and ord(gj) 3 3 for j # i, where ?j is a coset of J: Fj = sj + J. In addition, we also give 
an alternative proof in Section 3 for the main result in [4], including the missing cases. 
By convention, terminology and notation not mentioned here are referred to 
as in [S, 71. 
2. Pseudo-Cartesian product of cycles 
First, we recall some definitions. 
Definition 2.1. The cartesian product G = G1 x G2 has vertex set V(G) = V(G,) x 
V(G,) and edge set E(G) = (( u1,u2)(u1~02)(u1 = u1 and u2u2eE(G2) or u2 = u2 and 
~1~1 WGi)}. 
From now on, we let Ci = u1u2 ... anal and C2 = bl b2 ... b,bl be two cycles. By 
convention, the subscripts of a are expressed modulo II and the subscripts of b are 
expressed modulo m. 
The following definition was introduced in [8]. 
Definition 2.2. For 0 < r < m - 1, the r-pseudo-Cartesian product of Ci and C2, 
denoted by Ci x, C2, is the graph which is obtained from C1 x C2 by replacing the 
edge set {(al, bi) (u,, bi) 11 d i 6 WI> by the edge set {(al, bi+l) (a,, bi) I 1 6 i < m}. 
From the definition, it is easy to see that Cr x0 C2 = Cr x C2 = Ci x, C2. For 
convenience, we call the edges with the same first component vertical edges and the 
others horizontal-type edges in an r-pseudo-Cartesian product. Also, we call the vertex 
set {(ai, bj) 1 1 d i < VI} the bj-row and the vertex set {(ai, bj) I 1 < j < m] the ui-column. 
C. Fan et al. I Discrete Mathematics 158 (1996) 49-62 51 
Remark 2.3. If gcd(r, m) = t in an r-pseudo-Cartesian product Ci x V C2, then the 
horizontal-type edges form a 2-factor H which consists oft cycles of length (mn)/t and 
any consecutive t rows of Ci x,.CZ are on t different cycles of H. 
In 1973, Kotzig proved that the Cartesian product of any two cycles can be 
decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles (see [6] for a short proof). Here, we 
generalize this result to any pseudo-Cartesian product of two cycles. 
We first give three simple facts. 
Fact 2.4. If uluZ~E(Q1) and v~~;~E E(Q2) where Q1 and Q2 are two disjoint cycles, 
then (QIuQ2 - (u~u~,v~u~~)u~u~u~.u~~~, \ is a cycle. 
Fact 2.5. Given a cycle C, let ulu2 and vlv2 be edges of C which are separated by 
at least two edges. Then (C - (u1u~,v1v2})u~uIv1, u2c2J is a 2-factor containing at 
most two cycles. 
Fact 2.6. Given a cycle C, let uluz and v1v2 be edges of C which are separated by at 
least two edges. If the four vertices appear on C in the order u1,u2,v1,v2. then 
(C - ju1u2,cIv2})u{u1v1,u2v~~ is a cycle. 
For the following discussions, we color all horizontal-type edges by one color, say 
blue, and all vertical edges by another color, say red, in C, x ,. C2. 
Definition 2.7. A color switching in C, x,C2 means that for some 1 6 i 6 n - 1 and 
some 1 d s d m we interchange the colors between the edge sets {(q, b,)(ai, b,, 1), 
(ai+l,bs)(ai+l,bs+l)3 and ((ai,b,)(ai+l,b,), (ai,bs+l)(a;+l,bs+l)), and we call it the 
{Ui. ai+ 1, b,, b,Y+ i}-color switching. 
The next proposition is Lemma 3.13 in [8] which can be seen easily from 
Remark 2.3 and Fact 2.4. 
Proposition 2.8. If gcd(r,m) = 2t + 1 3 3, then, by making the color switchings 
1,2, . . ,2t in C, x r C, shown in Fig. 1, we obtain a blue hamiltonian cycle and connect 
three red cycles in the aj-columns for j = 1,2,3 to a single red cycle. 
Note that if we give a direction to the blue hamiltonian cycle H in Fig. 1 so that it 
becomes a directed cycle, then all blue arcs in the same row have the same direction, 
the blue arcs in the b,i+ i-row and the blue arcs in the bzi-row have opposite direction 
for each 0 < i d t. Moreover, all the blue arcs in the bi-row and b2,+2-row have the 
same direction as these two rows are in the same blue cycle before the color 
switchings. Thus, it follows that the blue arcs in the b,,+ i-row and b2t+2-row have the 
same direction. By Fact 2.6, any additional color switching between these two rows 
will still yield a blue hamiltonian cycle. This leads to the next lemma.

Lemma 2.9. If gcd(r,m) = 2t + 1 2 3, then, by making the color switchings shown in 
Fig. 1 with x = 0 and the color switching X = (as, a4, b,,, 1, b21+2}, we obtain a blue 
hamiltonian cycle and connect four red cycles in the aj-columns for j < 4 to a single red cycle. 
Similarly, Remark 2.3 and Fact 2.4 imply the next lemma. 
Lemma 2.10. If gcd(r,m) = 2t 3 4 and n > 4, then, by making the color switchings 
1,2, . . ,2t - 1 in C1 x, C2 shown in Fig. 2, we obtain a blue hamiltonian cycle and 
connect the jirst four columns to a single red cycle.

Suppose that X1,X2, . . . , Xk (with k > 3) are edge-disjoint color switchings in 
C1 x ,. Cz. We say Xk_ 1 and Xk form a good pair if no switching Xi for i < k - 3 is to 
the right of Xke2,Xk- 1 is to the right of XkPZ,Xk is to the right of Xk-l, and there is 
a positive integer J’ such that Xk_ 2 and Xk are between the h,-row and h,, 1-row while 
Xk-, is either between the h,_ 1-row and /JV-row or between the b,+I-row and 
h p+ 2-row. 
Lemma 2.11. Suppose that X1, Xz, . . . , Xk (with k 2 3) are edge-disjoint color switch- 
ings in C1 x ,. Cz such that Xk_ ,, Xk form a good pair. If, by making the color sGtchings 
X1 ,X2, . . . , Xke2, we have a blue hamiltonian cycle, then Mae still have a hlue hamil- 
tonian cycle after making the two additional color sM+tchings X,_ , and XL. 
Proof. Suppose, by making the color switchings X1, X,, . . . , Xk _ 2, we have a blue 
hamiltonian cycle H. We first make the color switching Xk. If follows from Fact 2.5 
that H is separated into two blue cycles with one contained within the h,-row and 
h ,.+ ]-row. Then it follows from Fact 2.4 that by completing the color switching Xk _ 1 
these two blue cycles are connected to a blue hamiltonian cycle again. 0 
Lemma 2.12. If gcd(r, m) = 1 or 2, then C1 x * C2 has a hamiltonian decomposition. 
Proof. We first make the color switching X = jaI,a2,hI, h,) and claim that this 
switching results in a blue hamiltonian cycle. In fact, if gcd(r,m) = 2, then the claim 
follows directly from Remark 2.3 and Fact 2.4. For gcd(r,m) = 1, it follows from 
Remark 2.3 that the horizontal-type edges (i.e., the blue edges) of C, x,C2 already 
form a hamiltonian cycle H before the switching X. Furthermore, if we give a direction 
to H so that H becomes a directed cycle, then the directions on all subpaths 
Pi = (aI, hi),(az, hi), . . , (a,,, hi) for 1 < i < m are the same, say from (al, bi) to (a,, hi) 
(i.e., from the left to the right). Thus, the claim follows from Fact 2.6. Now, let 
d = L (n - 2)/2 1. Define the color switchings X1,X2, . . . , XZd such that Xzi_ 1 = 
(azi.a2i+lvh,,h3j and X2i = (azi+l,azi+z,hl, h,}. By making these color switchings 
intheorderX,,X,, . . . , XZd with one pair X,i- l and Xzi at each time, it follows from 
Lemma 2.11 that we end up with a blue hamiltonian cycle H. By Fact 2.4, we also have 
a red cycle Q consists of the vertices in the ai-columns for i < 2d + 2. Thus, when n is 
even, we have a hamiltonian decomposition already. When n is odd, we have a red 
2-factor consists of two cycles: Q and the one in the a,-column. Let Y, be the 
{a,~_ 1, a,, b,,h,)-color switching and let YZ switch the colors of two edge sets 
((al.hl+,)(a,,h,), (a,,b,+,)(a,,b,)I and j(al,bI+,)(aI.hz+,), (a,,bl)(u,,hz)i. Then 
X and Y2 are edge-disjoint since r # 0 and m. By the same argument as in the proof of 
Lemma 2.11, we conclude that we still have a blue hamiltonian cycle after making the 
two color switchings Y 1 and Y2. To see we also end up with a red hamiltonian cycle, 
we first make the switching Y 1 to obtain a red hamiltonian cycle Q’. Note that if we 
give a direction to Q’ so that Q’ becomes a directed cycle, then all red arcs in the same 
column have the same direction and the red arcs in the ai-column and the red arcs in 
54 C. Fan et al. /Discrete Mathematics 158 (1996) 49-62 
theai+r -column have opposite direction for each 1 < i d n - 1. Since n is odd, the red 
arcs in the al-column and a,-column have the same direction. Thus, by Fact 2.6, the 
switching Y2 still keeps a red hamiltonian cycle and we obtain a hamiltonian 
decomposition in Cr x * C2. 0 
Lemma 2.13. If gcd(r, m) = 2t > 4, then, C1 X, C2 has a hamiltonian decomposition. 
Proof. For n = 3, we make the color switchings 1,2, . ,2t - 2 in C1 x, C2 shown in 
Fig. 2 and the color switching X that switches the colors of the edge sets {(a,, b,,_ 1 +,.) 
b,h-I), (a~,b2t+r)(~3,bd} and {(al,b2t-l+*)(al,bzt+~), h,b-d(a~,b2,)}. Then 
it follows from Remark 2.3 and Fact 2.4 that we have a blue hamiltonian cycle. Also, it 
is easy to see that the red edges form a hamiltonian cycle. Thus, we assume that n 3 4. 
By applying Lemma 2.10 to Cr x ,. Cz, we obtain a blue hamiltonian cycle and connect 
the aj-columns for j < 4 to a single red cycle. The rest of this proof is similar to the 
proof of Lemma 2.12 if we use the bj-rows for j = 2t - 1,2t,2t + 1 instead of 
j = 1,2,3. 0 
Lemma 2.14. Zf gcd(r,m) = 2t + 1 2 3, then, C1 x, C2 has a hamiltonian de- 
composition. 
Proof. We first apply Proposition 2.8 if n is odd or Lemma 2.9 if n is even to C1 x * C2 
to obtain a blue hamiltonian cycle H and connect the aj-columns for 1 < j d h to a red 
cycle, where h = 3 if n is odd, and 4 otherwise. Now, we have n - h + 1 red cycles. 
Since n and h have the same parity, n - h = 212~ for some nonnegative integer nl . Let 
y = 2 if n is odd, and 2t + 1 otherwise. For tiI > 0, we define the color switchings 
Xl,XZ, ... 9 X2,,, such that Xzi + 1 = (a h+2i,ah+2i+l,by-l,by} andXzi.2 = {ah+2i+l, 
a,,+z+&vby+d. Th en it follows from Fact 2.4 that making the color switchings 
XI,XZ, ... ,X2,,, connects n - h + 1 = 2nl + 1 red cycles to a red hamiltonian cycle. 
Also, we end up with a blue hamiltonian cycle by applying Lemma 2.11 nl times. 0 
Combining Lemmas 2.12, 2.13, and 2.14, we have derived the following result. 
Theorem 2.15. Any pseudo-Cartesian product C1 x, C2 can be decomposed into two 
hamiltonian cycles. 
3. Main results 
We begin this section by introducing the graphs Dk which were defined in [S]. 
Recall that Cr = a, a2 ... ana1 and C2 = bI b2 ... b,bI are two cycles of order n and m, 
respectively. 
C. Fan et al. /Discrete Mathematics 158 (1996) 49-E 55 
Definition 3.1. For k > 2, define D, to be a graph satisfying: 
(1) V(D,) = {(ui, bj) 11 < i d PI and 1 < j d m>, 
(2) E(Dk) can be decomposed into 2-factors HI, Hz, . . , Hk _ 1 and F, 
(3) F = lJr=IFi, where each Fi is the cycle (ui,bl)(ai,b2)...(ui,b~)(ai,blX and 
(4) For 1 <j < k - 1, HjUF = C{ xr,C2, where 0 6 Tj < m - 1 and C$ = ui,,r, 
4,(2, .” 4,(&Jl) with nj being a permutation of (1,2, . , n) and (a!, b,) = (q, b,,,, ) 
for 1 d i < n with 0 < hi,i < m - 1. 
Clearly, from the definition it is easy to see that in each HjU F = C{ x r,C2 the edges 
of Hj are horizontal-type while the edges of F are vertical. 
Let A be a finite abelian group, S = {s1,s2, , sk) be a generating set of A such 
that O&S, s E S implies - s$S, and m = ord(sk) 3 3. Then all edges in cay(A. S) which 
are generated by sk form a a-factor F. Furthermore, F consists of n = 1 A l/m cycles of 
length m. Let J = (Sk) and S = {S, ,.Fz, . . . - .sk_r) G A, = A/J, where we use X to 
represent the coset x + J. 
Definition 3.2. For any edge X j of cuy(A, , S) where X - j = Si E S, we call the edge set 
(uIu2/U1 =x,u2 =yandu, - u2 = si} of cuy(A, S) the lifting edge set of the edge x 1’. 
Remark 3.3. If we start with a set S = .(s1,s2, . . . , $1 of A such that SE S implies 
- ~$3, then it is possible that Si = _t sjESfor 1 < i fj < k - 1. For the case Si = 5j 
(or - gj) we will have multiple edges for each pair X and j such that X - ,: = &, one 
for Si and one for Sj (or - Sj). The edge Xl, for Si will lift to the edge set 
_ - ~u,u2~lnl = x,u2 =yandu, - u2 = si) while the edge x y for Si (or - Sj) will lift to the 
- - edge set {uluz IU, = x,u2 = j and tl, - ~2 = sj (or - sj)). 
Definition 3.4. For any subgraph Q of cay(Al, s), the subgraph Q of cay(A, S) with the 
edge set being the union of the lifting edge sets of the edges of Q is called the subgraph 
lifted by Q and we say Q lifts to Q. 
It is easy to see from the above definitions that edge-disjoint subgraphs of cuy(A,, 3) 
lift to edge-disjoint subgraphs of ca!jA, S). 
With Remark 3.3, Corollary 3.9 in [S], which works for minimal generating set S 
of A, can be extended directly to the following. 
Lemma 3.5. Suppose Al = {al,&, , ii,). If the Cayley multigraph cuy(A,, S) can 
be decomposed into k - 1 hamiltonian cycles fi, , li2, . . , H,_ 1, where Ri = L?~,,~,, 
%(Zl “‘un,(n), %,(l,, then cuy(A,S) E Dk, where F is the 2-factor generated by sk und 
each Hi is the 2-factor lifted by fii. 
We now give an alternative proof of the main result in [4], including the missing 
cases, as follows.

Theorem 3.6. Every 4-regular connected Cayley graph cay(A,S) on a finite abelian 
group A can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Suppose cay(A, S) is a 4-regular connected Cayley graph on a finite abelian 
group A. By Remark 1.1, S is a generating set of A and either S = {sr ,s2} with each 
si having order at least 3, or S = {s1,s2,sJ} with two elements of order two or 
S={ sl, s2, s3, s4) with all elements of order 2. 
Case 1: S = {s1,s2}. Without loss of generality, we assume s1 # f s2 and 
ord(sI) 3 m = ord(sz). Let J = (sZ) and AI = A/J. Then A1 is generated by Si. Let 
n = ord(S1). If n > 3, cay(A,, {S,) is a cycle. It follows from Lemma 3.5 that 
cay(A, S) g D, = C1 x * Cz. By Theorem 2.15, cay(A, S) can be decomposed into two 
hamiltonian cycles. For n = 2, we have 2si E (So). Since ord(s,) > ord(sz) = 1 A1/2, it 
follows that ord(sI) = ord(s2) or 1 A 1. In this case, it is not difficult to obtain a hamil- 
tonian decomposition of cay(A, S). 
Case 2. S = (si, s2, s3} with two elements of order two. Without loss of generality, 
assume that ord(s2) = ord(s,) = 2. Let J = ({s2,s3$) = {0,s2,s3,s2 + s3J and 
Ai = A/J = {0,S1,2SI, . . . ,(n - l)S,}. Let C’ = os12s, ...(n - l)siO and 
C” = Os2(s1 + ss)s30. Then, under the map cp:x + y -+ (x, y), it follows that for 
ns, = 0, cay(A,S) E C’ x C” and for nsl = s2 + s3, cay(A,S) r C’ x2C”, thus 
cay(A,S) has a hamiltonian decomposition by Theorem 2.15. For nsl = s2 or s3, 
cay(A, S) is the graph shown in Fig. 3, where the intersection of x-row and y-column is 
the element x + y. If we color the vertical edges by red and all the other edges by blue, 
then it is easy to see that the color switchings shown in Fig. 3 will result in 
a hamiltonian decomposition of cay(A, S). 
Case 3. S = {si, s2, s3, s4} with all elements having order 2. In this case, it is easy to 
see that cay(A,S) FZ K2 x K2 x K2 x K, = C4 x Cq, where C4 is a cycle of order 4. 
Thus, cay(A, S) can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. 0 
Now, we focus on 6-regular connected Cayley graphs on abelian groups. We shall 
first decompose the graph D3 into three hamiltonian cycles for certain cases, which 
generalizes the following theorem from [3] for the corresponding cases.

Theorem 3.7 (Aubert and Schneider 131). !fG can he decomposed into two humiltonian 
cycles and C is a cycle. then G x C cun be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. 
The following result is Lemma 3.14 in [S]. 
Proposition 3.8. Let n be odd. Assume each Hi in D3 consists of2ti + 1 > 3 cycles for 
i = 1 and 2. If’the sets K1 = j71,(1),7~~(2),n,(3),7c~(4)i and K2 = [x2(1),7t2(2),7r2(3)) 
have exactly one common element 7rI (4) = rc2( l), then D3 can he decomposed into three 
humiltonian cycles. 
By using the same method, we now prove a result similar to the above proposition 
for II even. For convenience, we color the edges of D3 so that the edges in F are red, the 
edges in HI are blue, and the edges in Hz are green. 
Lemma 3.9. Let n > 6 he even. Assume Hz consists of 2t, + 1 > 3 cycles. Jf‘ the sets 
KI = C71*(1),711(2),7~1(3),7~1(4)) and Kz = (~r~(1),71~(2),71~(3)) hutle exactly one com- 
mon element n, (4) = x2(1), then D3 can he decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Our goal is to make some edge-disjoint color switchings in D3 to obtain three 
monochromatic hamiltonian cycles. Without loss of generality, we assume that 
nl(i) = p - 4 + i(modn) and j7c2(2),n2(3)i = (q,n), where 4 <p < 4 < n. Note that 
the jump r in an r-pseudo-cartesin product C, x,Cz can be located in between 
any two ad.jacent columns after some necessary changes. We may view 
HluF = C: x,., C2 as C1 x1> Cz after we locate the jump rl in between the ai-columns 
for i = 1, n instead of i = p - 4, p - 3. Let t = gcd(rI, m). By Remark 2.3, HI consists 
oft blue cycles of equal length and any t consecutive rows in HI uF = C, x,, Cz are in 
t different blue cycles. If t = 1, then H, is a hamiltonian cycle. By Theorem 2.15, 
H,uF = Cf x,? C2 can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles, and so D3 can be 
decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. Thus, we assume t > 2. We claim that in 
HI uF, by making some color switchings within the ai-columns for 1 < j d 4 and with 
only one color switching between the a,-column and a,-column, we obtain a blue 
hamiltonian cycle and connect the first four columns to a single red cycle. In fact, for 
t 3 3, the claim follows directly from Lemmas 2.9 and 2.10. For t = 2, by Fact 2.4 and 
Lemma 2.11. the claim follows by making the color switchings X, = {a,,u2,h,, hzj. 
X? = (~lZ>%hZ>b3}, and X3 = (u3,u4. hI, h2). Suppose we have made the corres- 
ponding color switchings to obtain the claim. Now let 2’ be the integer such that the 
only color switching between the u,-column and a,-column is (Us, u4, h,, !I,+, ). We 
make the color switchings Y, , Y L. . Y, _ ,, in H 1 u F = C, x r, C2 defined as follows: 
Y,, Y,, . , Y,_, are defined so that 
58 C. Fan et al. /Discrete Mathematics 158 (1996j 49-62 
yq-4, y,-3, ... 5 Y, _ 6 are defined so that 
Yzi-1 = {U 21+2+r9a2i+3+x, b y-1, yj b ’ or {aZi+2+x,a2i+3+x,by+l,by+2} 
y2i = ia2i+3+x,a 2r+4+x,by>by+& 
where x = 1 if 7r2(2) > 7c2(3) (i.e., 7c2(2) = n and ~~(3) = q), and x = 2 if ~~(2) < ~~(3) 
(i.e., ~~(2) = q and ~~(3) = n). By Fact 2.4, it follows that the red 2-factor F’ now 
consists of three red cycles where one red cycle consists of the vertices in the 
aj-columns for j 6 q - 1, one red cycle consists of the vertices in the a~~C2,-column, and 
the other consists of the remaining vertices. Moreover, since n - 6 is even, from 
Lemma 2.11 it follows that we still have a blue hamiltonian cycle. Since p 3 4, there 
are at most two non-red vertical edges in the a,-column (i.e., a~zcI,-column), they are 
el = (a,,&-r)(a,,b,) or (q,,b,+r)(a,,b,+,) and e2 = (a,,b,)(q,,b,+r). 
Next, we will make some color switchings in H,uF, which are edge-disjoint from all 
the color switchings above, to obtain a green hamiltonian cycle and meanwhile 
connect the red cycles to a red hamiltonian cycle. Notice that there is exactly one 
vertical edge in the a:* ,3) -column which is not red, say e3, and all vertical edges in the 
2 
u,l,2,-column are red. Also, note that for j = 1 or 3, the vertical edges in the 
2 ~,~~~,-colurnn involved in the color switchings shown in Fig. 4 form a matching. We 
claim that, by choosing k properly, we can make the color switchings shown in 
Fig. 4 in H,uF = Cf x *2 C2 without using the edges el, e2, and e3. In fact, by the 
definition ofthe Y*i_ 1 switchings, we can assume el = (a,, by_ l)(u,, b,). Suppose k. is 
the integer such that el = (arS,(1,,b2fl+k~,)(ar5,(1,,b2f,+k,+1) and e2 = (~&~),b2~z+k,+l) 
(a2 b n,clj, 2t,+k,,+2). If for k = k. the color switchings shown in Fig. 4 do not use e3, then 
we are done. Suppose for k = k. those color switchings need to use e3. Then, again by 
the definition of the Yzi_ 1 switchings, we can assume e, = (a,, by+ l)(u,, by+2). Now,

set k = kO + 1, then the color switchings shown in Fig. 4 do not use the edges e,, e2, or 
e3. Since ycd(r,,m) = 2t, + 1 3 3, it follows from Proposition 2.8 that we obtain 
a green hamiltonian cycle by completing the color switchings shown in Fig. 4 in 
Hzu F = Cf x Ti C2 without destroying the existing blue hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, 
the three red cycles of F’ are connected to a red hamiltonian cycle via the Uf,,j,- 
columns for 1 <j < 3, namely, the uj-columns for j = p,q, II. Therefore, D, has 
a hamiltonian decomposition. 0 
Lemma 3.10. Suppose m = 2h + 1 und n = 2~1~ + 1 3 5. Assume that each Hi in 
03 consists ?f ti > 2 cycles for i = 1 and 2, and tz < JR Jf’ tlze sets K, = 
(~1(1),~1C4,~,(3)) and K1 = {~z(l),zc2(2),7c2(3)) i lalje exactl)! one common element 
x1(3) = 712(l), then D3 can be decomposed into hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume that ~~(1) = p - 2, x1(2) = p - 1, 
~~(3) = p, and {x1(2), n,(3)] = (q,nj, where 3 < p < q < n. By the hypothesis and 
Remark 2.3, it follows that for i = 1 and 2, 3 < ti = gcd(ri,m) = 2hi + 1 and 
t2 = 2h, + 1 6 m/3. We apply Proposition 2.8 to H,uF = C1 x,.~ Cz to obtain a blue 
hamiltonian cycle and connect the aj-columns for 1 d j 6 3 to a single red cycle. Let 
y be an even integer between 2 and 2hI. Then, similar to the proof of Lemma 3.9, we 
define the color switchings Y1, Y2, , Ynp5 in HluF = C1 x,.~ C2 starting with the 
a,-column, and obtain a hamiltonian decomposition of D3 with more freedom to 
choose k here when we apply Proposition 2.8 to H2uF since t, < m/3. ??
Lemma 3.11. Suppose m = 2h + 1 > 9 and n = 5. If each Hi in D3 consists of three 
cycles,for i = 1 and 2, then D, can be decomposed into hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume n, = 1 (the identity permutation). Consider 
the multigraph G on five vertices 1,2,3,4 and 5 which is the union of two hamiltonian 
cycles C’ = 123451 and C” = z2(l)n2(2)n2(3)z2(4)z1(5)7C,(1L If G # Kg, then it is 
easy to see that we can redefine 7c2 so that ~~(1) = 3 and (~~(2). ecu) = (4,5). By 
Lemma 3.10, D3 has a hamiltonian decomposition. For the case G = Kg, we may 
assume rc2 = (2354). Since n1 = 1, we may assume HluF = C, x,.~ Cz. By the hypoth- 
esis and Remark 2.3, for i = 1 and 2, gcd(ri, m) = 3 and any three consecutive rows in 
HiuF are in the three different cycles of H;. We make the following two color 
switchings in H 1 uF 
Since m 3 9, there must exist an integer y such that all the vertical edges within the 
bj-rows for y G j < y + 2 in H2 u F = Cf x I2 C2 are red. Then we make the following 
two color switchings in H2uF 
X3 = {&a: b b ’ 3 1” ,‘+I] and X4 = ~a~,a~,b,+I,b,+,j. 
60 C. Fan et al. /Discrete Mathematics 158 (1996) 49-62 
Clearly, Xi for 1 < i d 4 are edge-disjoint. It is easy to see that we now have three 
monochromatic hamiltonian cycles. 0 
We also need the following two results which are Lemmas 2.5 and 3.3 in [S], 
respectively. 
Proposition 3.12. Let A be u finite abelian group generated by S = {sl, s2, . . . , sk), 
A’ be the subgroup generated by S’ = S - (~1, and J = (sk). If JnA’ = {0}, then 
cay(A, S) = cay(A’, S’) x cay(J, {sk}). 
Proposition 3.13. Let G be a 4-regular connected multigraph with at least nine vertices 
which can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. Then, for each hamiltonian 
decomposition of G, there exists a path P = ulu2 ‘.. u6 such that PI = uIu2u3uq is on 
one hamiltonian cycle while P2 = u4u5u6 is on the other. 
Also, we have a similar lemma. 
Lemma 3.14. Let G be a 4-regular connected multigraph with at least seven vertices 
which can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. Then, for each hamiltonian 
decomposition of G, there exists a path P = UIU~U~U~U~ such that PI = uluzu~ is on one 
hamiltonian cycle while P, = u3u4u5 is on the other. 
Proof. Let P = UIUZU~ be a subpath on Hi. Then ur, u2,u3 divide H2 into three 
subpaths. Since Hz has length at least 7, one of the three subpaths has length at least 
three. Then we can find a desired path easily upon a relabeling if necessary. 0 
Now we are ready to present our main results. 
Theorem 3.15. Suppose that A is aJinite abelian group and S = {sl, s2, sj} is a genera- 
ting set of A. Zf S has an element si of odd order such that for J = (si), A, = A/J has at 
least nine elements and ord(.?j) 3 3 for j # i, then cay(A, S) can be decomposed into three 
hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume that m = ord(s3) is odd and for J = (s3), 
AI = A/J has order n 2 9 and ord(Fj) > 3 for j = 1 and 2. By Theorem 3.6, 
cay(A,, {sI,s2}) can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles. By Lemma 3.5, 
we conclude that cay(A, S) g D3, where HiUF = Ci x I, C2 for i = 1 and 2. By Remark 
2.3, each Hi consists of gcd(ri,m) = 2ti + 1 cycles. If one oft, and t2 equals 0, say tl, 
then H, is a hamiltonian cycle. By Theorem 2.15, H2uF can be decomposed into two 
hamiltonian cycles, and so cay(A, S) can be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. 
Thus, we assume that 2ti + 1 3 3 for i = 1 and 2. Then it follows from Propositions 
3.8 and 3.13 and Lemma 3.9 that cay(A, S) can be decomposed into three hamiltonian 
cycles. 0

For an abelian group A, we say that a generating set S of A is strongly minimal if for 
any SE S, 2&S - {s\i). As a consequence of Theorem 3.15, we have the following 
corollary. 
Corollary 3.16. Suppose A is an ahelian group of’ even order. Zf S = {sl ,s2, .s3} is 
a strongly minimal generating set of A with an element of odd order, then cay(A, S) can 
be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. 
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume that nz = ord(s3) is odd. Let J = (sg) and 
A, = A/J. Since S is strongly minimal, we must have ord(Ti) 3 3 for i = 1,2. Let B be 
the subgroup of A, generated by Si. Then there are at least three cosets of B in A1 for 
otherwise 2s, would be an element in ( (si , s3 j ), contradicting the assumption that 
S is strongly minimal. Thus 1 AI 1 2 9 and the result follows from Theorem 3.15. l-J 
We also have the following result. 
Theorem 3.17. Suppose that A is an abeliun group oj’odd order and S = {s1,s2,s3j. is 
a generating set of A such that ord(s,) 3 ord(s2) > ord(s,). Then cay(A,S) can be 
decomposed into three hamiltoniun cJ>cles. 
Proof. Let J = (s3) and AI = A/J. Then S = {S1,S2} is a generating set of A,. By 
Lagrange’s theorem [7], both m = IJI and n = 1 AI 1 are odd. By Theorem 3.15, we 
need only consider 3 6 n d 7. Since n is prime, ord(S1) = ord(s2) = n. It follows that 
ord(si) 3 n for i = 1,2 and cay(AI,S) has a hamiltonian decomposition Hi, IT,, 
where each Ri is generated by Si. By Lemma 3.5, cay(A,S) E D3, where each Hi is 
generated by si. If ord(sI) = 1 AI, then Hi is a hamiltonian cycle and by Theorem 2.15, 
H,uF = CT x ,.2 C2 can be decomposed into two hamiltonian cycles, and so caJ$A. S) 
can be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. Assume ord(sI) < 1 Al. Then n # 3 
since ord(s,) < ord(s,) 6 ord(s,) < / A I and 1 A I = mn. If m d 7, then m is prime, and 
this implies ord(si) = ord(Si) = n for i = 1,2 since n < ord(s,) < ord(s,) < ) AJ = mn, 
and so JnA’ = {O), where A’ = (is,,s,)). It follows from Proposition 3.12 and 
Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 that cay(A, S) can be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. 
Assume m > 9. If YI = 5, then we must have ord(sl) = ord(s2) = I A//3 since 
9 < ord(s,) < ord(s2) d ord(s,) < / A(, and so it follows from Lemma 3.11 that 
cay(A, S) can be decomposed into three hamiltonian cycles. In n = 7, then, similarly, 
each Hi consists of 2 d ti < m cycles since Hi is generated by si, and SO the theorem 
follows from Lemmas 3.10 and 3.14. [7
