Abstract 
The cationic uranium amide compound [U(COTXNEt,XTHF),][BPh,] 1 (COT - r)-C8H,. THF - tctrahydrofuran) reacted with the 
nucleophiles MX (LiCH(SiMe3&. NaN(SiMe&, KCsHs. KCsMe,. Lit3 and KBH,) to give the corresponding neutral addition 
complexes [ll(COTXNEr2XX)l, Insertion of CO,, CS, or MeCN into the U-N bond of 1 afforded respectively 
[U(COTXE,CNEt,XTHF),][BPh,] (E - 0 or S) and [U(COTXNC{Me)(NEt,)XTHF),][BPh,]. Reactions of 1 with the proton acidic 
molecules NEt,HCI, CsH, and ‘PrEH (E = 0 or S) led to the formation of [U(COTXClXTHF~,I[BPh,l, [U(COTXC,H5XTHF121[BPh4] 
and [U(COTXE’Pr)~l respectively. The crystal structures of [lXCOTXNEt,XTHF),l [BPh,] and [lJ(COTXS,CNEt,XTHF),l[BPh,l have 
been determined.

The reactions of complex 1, which are summarized 
in Scheme 1, have been performed in THF, toluene or 
diethyl ether, generally at 20 “C, altllough 1 was poorly 
soluble in these solvents; in contrast to [U(COT)- 
(NEtt,),(THF)], 1 could br: dissolved in dichloromethane 
without decomposition. In the presence of a nucleophile 
X-, the cationic species [U(COTHNEt,)(THF)2]f was 
transformed into the corresponding neutral addition 
product [U(COT)(NEt,)(XMTHF),]. The synthesis of 
the mixed ring compounds [U(COTXC,R,)(NEt,)] (R 
= H, 2 or Me, 3) by treatment of 1 with KC,R, has 
already been reported [2]. The chloro- and tetrahydrobo- 
rato-amide complexes [U(COT)(NEt,XXXTH~)),] (X = 
C9, 4 or BH,, S), which were readily formed from 1 
2.50 C. Btdssnn L’I ul. / Journul c~Or~unometullic Chemistry 522 i 1996) 249-257 
upon addition of LiCl or KBHJ, were stable in THF 
solution but could not be isolated in the solid form, 
being decomposed into [U(COT)z] and other unidenti- 
fied species by desolvation. Complex 4 was previously 
obtained by treating [U(COT)(NEt, &(THF!] with 
NEt3HCI [S]; the behaviour of 5 is in contrast to that of 
the alkoxide analogues [U(COTXORxBH,)] (R = Et, 
‘Pr, ‘Bu) which were quite stable in the solid state [6]. 
Orange microcrystals of fU(COT)(NEt z )(CH- 
{SiMeJr)] 6, a new example of a monocyclooctate- 
traene uranium alkyl compound (71, were isolated in 
58% yield from the reaction of 1 and LiCH(SiMe,),, 
whereas the brown sticky powder of the mixed b&amide 
complex [U(COT)(NEt, KN(SiMe,Jz I] 7 was obtained 
from 1 and NaN(SiMe,), (72% yield). 
insertion of unsaturated molecules into the M-NRz 
bond is a classical reaction of metal amide compounds 
[$I. The carbamate complex [U(COTKO,CNEt,),] was 
thus synthesized by reacting [U(COTXNEt, ),(THF)] 
with carbon dioxide [S]. Similar treatment of I with 
CO, or CS, afforded the cationic carbamate and dithio- 
carbnmate derivatives [U(COTXO,CNEt Z )(THF),V]- 
[BPhJ] 8 and [U(COT)(S,CNEt,)(THF),]- 
(BPh,] 9; the lutter was isolated as ochre microcrystals 
in 88% yield. Complex 1 reacted in THF with MeCN, 
giving orange crystals of the cationic aminido com- 
pound [U(CsT)(NCIMe}(NEt,))(THF)aHBPh,] IQ 
Id); in the IR spectrum, no absorption corre- 
to free or coordinated M&N was observed in 
region and the stron 
was attributed to the CN stretching vibru- 
tion [S], In contntst, trcstmsnt of the neutral precursor of 
1, [U(COT)[NEt,),(THF)], with I equivalent of M&N induced rapid precipitation of an insoluble and not yet 
characterized crystalline complex resulting from proto- 
nation of the NEt, ligand, as shown by concomitant 
liberation of free NEt,H (1 equivalent by NMR). Ace- 
tonitrile can in fact react with metal amides as an 
unsaturated molecule, giving the insertion aminido 
product [9] or/and as a protic species, giving the 
cyanoalkyl derivative [ 101. The abc ;e results suggested 
that 1 was not very sensitive to acids. 
Treatment of [Ml-NR, complexes with proton acidic 
substrates HA provides a straightforward route to [MI-A 
derivatives [8], while the novel reaction of uranium 
amides with NEt,HBPh, is useful for the synthesis of 
cationic compounds such as 1 [ 1.21. By the way, it was 
interesting to note that protonation of the bis-amide 
compound [U(CoT)(N~tt,XN(SiMe,),)] 7 led to the 
selective formation of the cation [U(COT)(N- 
ISiMe& XTHF),V]+ with liberation of NEt,H (NMR 
experiment); it is clear that the steric bulk and electron 
withdrawing character of the trimethylsilyl group dis- 
favour the approach of NEt,H+ onto the NfSiMe,), 
ligand. The cation [U(COT)(N(SiMe,},)(THF),lC could 
not be obtained directly from 1 which was inert towards 
(Me,Si),NH at 20 “C. Attempts to prepare the dication 
[IJ(coTXTHF~,$+ by treatment of 1 with NEt,HBPh, 
or NH,BPh, were unsuccessful. In the presence of 
NEt,HCI, 1 was almost quantitatively transformed into 
[U(COT~ClXTHF)JBPh,] 11, isolated as a brown mi- 
crocrystalline powder; this reaction certainly proceeded 
by the intermediacy of the shloro-amide [U(COTJ 
(NEt, )ICl#THF), I 4 which was tbcn protonatcd with 
NEt lEIBPh.,, Synthesis of the mixed-ring cationic com- 
plcx IU(G’BT~r4HS#r~~l:),]IBl”h,] 12 by touting 1 
\“‘.\ 'PrEH 
with cyclopentadiene has been previously reported [2]. 
This reaction nzquired 60 h to go to completion, whereas 
formation of [U(COTxC, H s KNEt z )] from [U(COT)- 
(NEt,),(THF)] and C,H, was achieved after only 24 h 
at 20 ‘C [5]. Complex 1 was inert towards the less 
acidic phenylacetylene (pK, of C,H, and PhC=CH 
are ca. 15 and 18.5 respectively [ 1 I]), in contrast to 
[U(COTXNEt,),(THF)] which was readily transformed 
into [UKOTXNEt z XC=CPh)] (NMR experiment) [ 121. 
As expected from the acidity scale, 1 immediately 
reacted with ‘PrSH (pK, ca 12) and was converted inro 
the neutral bisthiolate compound [U(COT)(S’Pr),] 13 
[ 131. Similar treatment of 1 with isopropanol, which has 
the same acidity as phenylacetylene, rapidly afforded 
the cationic alkoxide species [U(COT)(O’Pr)(THF),]‘; 
rhis could be characterized only by its NMR spectrum 
as it further reacted with ‘PrOH in the presence of 
NEt,H to give [U(COT)(OiPr)2] 14 [6]; the latter was 
also readily synthesized by alcoholysis of [U(COT)- 
(NEtz)$THF)] [Sl. The distinct reactivity of 1 towards 
isopropanol and phenylacetylene can be accounted for 
by initial coordination of ‘PrOH to the cation of 1, 
giving [U(COT)(NEt,)(‘PrOH)l+, followed by proton 
transfer and elimination of NEt,H; the intermediate 
[U(COT)(O’PrXTHF),]’ would itself coordinate an al- 
cohol molecule and [U(COT)(O’Pr)(‘PI~H)]+ would be 
deprotonated into [U(COT)(O’Pr),] 14 by NEt, H. Simi- 
lar effects of coordination on acidity have recently been 
evidenced in the acid-base reactions between the ura- 
nium tris-amide [U(N(SiMe,),),] and various nmines 
El41. The new complexes 5-11 were characterized by their 
elemental analyses (except 5 and 8) and their ‘H NMR 
spectra (Table 1). In all compounds, the COT signal 
appears in the high field region, around 6 -30; the 
resonances of the NEt, groups directly bound to the 
metal centre are visible at low field, near S +30 and 
+ 100 for the CH, and CH, protons respectively. In the 
spectrum of the alkyl complex 6, the signal correspond- 
ing to the hydrogen on the cy carbon was too broad to 
be located: this methine resonance was also not detected 
in the spectra of [U(C,MeS),(CH(SiMe,),)] [IS] and 
[U(CHISiMe,],),] [161. The spectrum of 10 exhibits 
magnetically nonequivalent ethyl groups, indicating that 
rotation about the CN bond is slow on the NMR time 
scale; this restricted rotation can be attributed to multi- 
ple CN bonding in hybrid B.

1.68(3) and 1.65(3) w appear respectively longer atd 
shorter than the typical values of 1.35 and 1.75 A. 
These distinct purumeters suggest that hybrid C has a 
mom important contribution to the true structure of 9.

In both compounds, the CsHs rings am planar within

average 2.644) A in 9 and 2.71(4) 8, in 15 are within 
the range of U-C(COT) bond lengths which vary from 
2.62 A in [U(COT)(S’Pr),] [ 139 and 2.70 A in the U(W) 
compound [U(COTXC, Me,)(dmbipy)] (dmbipy = 4,4’- 
dimethyl-2,2’-bipyridine) [22]; the typical value of 2.68 
w is found in most of the cycloctatetraene WV) com- 
plexes [6,13,23] and also in the U(V) cation [U(COT) 
(NEt,),(THF)]+ [S]. These results confirm that these 
metal-ligand distances cannot be related to the formal 
oxidation state of the uranium centre [5]. 
3. Concluding mnwks 
The cationir uranium amide complex [U(COT)- 
(NEt:t,XTHF),][BPh,] 1 was interesting for the prepara- tion of neutral derivatives of general formula [U(COT) 
(NEt,)(X)(THF),] which were obtained by nucleophi ‘2 
addition of X-. There syntheses further illustrate the 
practical use of catiouic precursors in ac:inide chem- 
istry, avoiding the problems with the tedious elimina- 
tion of salts and formation of *ate’ complexes which are 
frequently encountered in the classical metathesis reac- 
tion of halide compounds with lithium or Crignard 
reagents [1,2]. The advantage of such cationic com- 
plexes is even more evident when the corresponding 
halide cannot be isolated, as in the ease of [U(COT)- 
(NEt,XCI)(THF),]; in this context, it has also been 
reported that [lJ(NEt,),(Cl)] was not stable, being in 
equilibrium with [U(NEt,),(Cl),] and [U(NEtt,),], in 
contrast to [W(NEt2)al[BPh,] which was a convenient 
material for a variety of derivatives [I ,2], Cm- 
plex 1 was also useful to synthesize new cationis com- 
pounds by insertion of unsaturated molecules into the 
U-N bond; thus was obtained [U(COTXS,CNEt,)- 
(THF),l[BPh,], the first dithiocarbamate compound of 
U(W) to have been crystallographically characterized. 
Of special interest are the differences of reactivity be- 
tween a cationic amide complex and its corresponding 
neutral precursor which would lead to selective synthe- 
sis of new derivatives. By comparison with [U(COT) 
(NEt t ),(THF)], I was found to be less reactive towhlrds 
cyclopentadienc or phenylacetylene, a fact that may be 
explained by the slower attack of the proton acidic 
molecule onto the positively charged species. However, 
rapid reaction occurred between I and isopropanol; in 
this case, possible coordination of the alcohol molecule 
onto the cation would decrease its pK, and favour the 
cleavage of the U-N bond. Contrary to that observed 
with [U(COT)(NEt,),(THF)], acetonitrile did not proto- 
nab the NEt, ligand of 1 but inserted into the U-N 
bond to give the aminido derivative [U(COT) 
(NC[Me)(NEt2~HTHF),HBPh,l. 
4. Experimental details 
4.1. General methods 
~11 preparations and reactions were carried out under 
argon (less than 5 ppm oxygen or water) using standard 
Schlenk-vessel and vacuum-line techniques or in a glove 
box. Solvents were thoroughly dried and deoxygenated 
by standard methods and distilled immediately before 
use. Deuterated solvents were dried over Na-K alloy. 
Elemental analyses were performed by Analytische 
Laboratorien at Lindlar (Germany). The IR spectra were 
recorded in KBr plates on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X spec- 
trometer. The ‘H NMR spectra were recorded on a 
Bruker WP 60 WI’) instrument and were referenced 
internally using the residual protio solvent resonances 
relative to tetramethylsilane (8 0); the spectra are de- 
scribed in Table 1. 
The commercial reagents were dried by standard 
methods before use. NEtsHBPh, was prepared in water 
NuBPh, and NEt,WCI: the white powder 
ipitated was filtered off, washed successively 
with hot water and diethyl ether and dried under vac- 
uum. LiCH@iMs,), [24], NaN(SiMe,), [2S] and the 
uranium complex 1 (21 were synthesized by published 
methods, 
(d An NMR tube was char d with 1 (9.3 mg, 0.01 I 
mmolS and LiClUX5 mg, 0.01 mmol) in THF-ds (0.35

Fed solution showed that I was almost quantitatively 
transfOrmed into S. 
C~mpb~es 4 and 5 were stable in solution but 
evaporation of the solvent led to their decomposition 
into [U(COTI,l and unidentified compounds. 
A 50 ml round-boattomed flask was &urged with 1 
(339 mg, 8.38 mmol) and LiCH(SiMe,), (57 mg, 0.34

under vacuum at -78 “C. The temperature was slowly 
taked to 20 “c, the mixture was stirred For 2 h and the 
solution was FilteEd and evaporated to dryness. The residue was extracted in diethyl ether (3 X 10 ml), 
the solvent evaporated off and the product extracted in 
diethyl ether (25 ml). After evaporation and drying 
under vacuum, 6 was isolated as orange needles (1 IS

vacuum at -78 “C. The mixture was heated at 45 “C 
for 30 min and the red solution turned yellow. After 2 h 
at 20 OC. the solvent was evaporated off; the residue 
was dried under vacuum and then extracted in a mixture 
of pentane (20 ml) and toluene (IS ml). A brown pasty

4.8. Reaction of 7 with NEr, HBPh, 
An NMR tube was charged with 7 (10.0 mg, 0.017 
mmol) and NEtJHBPh, (7.3 mg, 0.017 mmol) in THF- 
d, (0.35 ml). After 10 min at 20 “C, the spectrum of the 
red solurion showed the signals of free NEt,H (1 
equivalent) and the resonances attributed to the cation 
[tJ(COT)(N(SiMe,),)(THF),]+. 6 6.0 (20 H, Ph), 2.05 
(18 H, SiMe,) and -32.64 (8 H, COT). 
4.9. Synthesis of CUICOT)(Cl)fTHF),IIBPh, 1 II 
A 50 ml round-bottomed flask was charged with 1 
(266 mg, 0.30 mmol) and NEt,HCl(39 mg, 0.28 mmol) 
and THF (20 ml) was condensed into it under vacuum 
at -78 “C. The flask was immersed in an ultrasound 
bath (60 W, 40 kHz) for 3 min at 40 “C; after this 
period the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min at 20 “CT. The red solution was filtered and its volume 
was reduced to 10 ml; addition of a 1: 1 mixture of 
THF-diethyi ether (20 ml) caused the precipitation of a 
brown powder of 11, which was filtered off, washed 
with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum (249 mg, 
96%). Anal. Found: C, 57.49; H, 5.54; N, 4.10. 
C,H,,BClO,U. Calc.: C, 57.87; H, 5.74; N, 3.88%. 
4.10. Reactions of 1 with ‘PrSH and ‘PrOH 
(a) An NMR tube was charged with 1 ( 10 mg, 0.011 
mmol) in THF-$ (0.35 ml) and ‘PrSH (2.0 ~1, 0.022 
mmol) was introduced via a microsyringe. After 10 min 
al 20 “C, the spectrum of the red solution showed that 1 
was completely transformed into [IJ(COT)(S’Pr),]. 
(b) An NMR tube was charged with 1 ( 13 mg, 0.015 
mmol) in ‘II-IF-d, (0.35 ml) and ‘PrOH (1 .l ~1, 0.014 
mmol) was introduced via a microsyringe. After 10 min 
at 20 “C, the spectrum of the red solution showed that 1 
was partially transformed into a 35:65 mixture of [U 
(COT)(O’Pr),l and [U(COT)(O’Pr)(THF),HBPh,]; 6

Selected single crystals were introduced into thin- 
walled Lindemann glass tubes in the glove box. Data 
were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractome- 
C. Boi.v.wn ev al. / Jonrnul c$Orpnwmctullic Chemistry 522 f 1996) 249-257 257 
ter equipped wifh 9 graphite monochromator ( A(Mo 
K (Y) = 0.70073 A). The cell pmmeters were obtained 
by a least squares refinement of the setting angles of 25 
reflections with 0 between 8 and 12”. Three standard 
reflections were measured after every hour; a decay was 
observed (63% in 11 h for 9 and 16% in 60 h for 15) 
and linearly corrected. The data were corrected for 
Lorentz polarization effects and absorption [26]. The 
structure was solved by the heavy-atom method and 
refined by full matrix least squares on F with anisotropic 
thermal parameters (U and S atoms for 9 and U atom 
for 15); H atoms were not introduced. All calculations 
were performed on a Vax 4000-200 computer with the 
Enraf-Nonius MolEN system [27]. Analytical scattering 
factors for neutral atoms were corrected for both Af’ 
and Ar components of anomalous dispersion [28]. 
Crystallographic data are given in Table 3 and final 
positional parameters in Tables 4 and 5.
