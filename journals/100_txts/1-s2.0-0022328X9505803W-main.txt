Abstract 
The synthesis, spectroscopic and structural characterization of new amido-fluorenyl ligand [{Me3CN(H)-Si(Me)2CH 2- 
C13Hs}Li(THF)] (1) is reported. The treatment of 1 with BuLi followed by the reaction with Group 4 metal chlorides led to crystalline, 
solvent free, metal complexes [{(~/1-NCMe3)Si(Me)2CH2(7/5-CI3H8)}MCI2] (where M = Ti (3), Zr (4) or Hf (5)) in good yield. The 
X-ray crystal structures of 4 and 5 are also reported. Both these compounds l~ossess monomeric structures with relatively short M-N and 
M-CI bonds. The M-N distances of 4 and 5 are 2.060(3) A and 2.065(3) A respectively. The metal ion is coordinated to the fluorene 
group in ~75-fashion. The X-ray data also indicate the presence of a relatively unstrained ligand backbone in these metal complexes.

1. Introduction 
The ansa-metallocene complexes of Group 4 metals 
are of importance in many areas including in catalytic 
alkene polymerizations and in the asymmetric induction 
[1-16]. Recently there has been increasing interest in 
the synthesis of ligands where one of the cyclopentadi- 
ene groups of ansa-metallocene has been replaced with 
groups such as amido or alkoxy donors [17-25]. The 
Group 3 and 4 metal complexes of these monocyclopen- 
tadiene-amido or -alkoxy ligands have also been found 
to act as catalysts for olefin polymerization reactions 
[17-19,21,26-30]. Furthermore, metal complexes of 
such amido-cyclopentadienyl ligands show higher Lewis 
acidity compared to the corresponding bis(cyclopenta- 
dienyl)metal complexes [19]. This increased elec- 
trophilicity of the metal center has been attributed largely 
to the reduction in the number of electrons donated to 
the metal center by the ligands [17,31]. In the absence 
of adequate steric protection, the metal complexes de- 
rived from these hybrid ansa-ligands often tend to form 
adducts with solvents, Lewis bases, alkali metal halides, 
or to form aggregates [17,21,25]. In certain instances,

SSDI 0022-328X(95)05803-6 this increased reactivity even leads to the formation of 
bis-ligand complex. For example, irrespective of the 
molar ratio, the reaction between [Me3CNSi(Me) 2- 
CsHa]Li 2 and ZrC14 leads exclusively to 
[MeaCNSi(Me)2C5 H 4 ]2 Zr [24]. 
We have focused our attention on the synthesis of 
sterically demanding ansa-ligand systems containing 
fluorene [32]. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of 
an amido-fluorenyl ligand with a -Si(Me)2CH 2- back- 
bone and its use in the synthesis of the dichloro metal 
complexes of Ti, Zr and Hr. Such systems could be 
expected to have relatively less strained ligand back- 
bone compared to systems with -CR 2- or -SiR 2- 
(where R = alkyl or aryl group) bridges and should 
offer better protection to the central metal ion. 
2. Experimental details 
All operations were carried out under an atmosphere 
of purified nitrogen using either standard Schlenk tech- 
niques or in a Vacuum Atmospheres single station dry 
box equipped with a -25°C refrigerator. Solvents were 
distilled from conventional drying agents and degassed 
twice prior to use [33]. Glassware was oven-dried at 
150°C overnight. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were 
recorded in C6D 6 at 25°C on a Bruker MSL-300 spec-

NT-200 spectrometer (1H, 200.06 MHz; 13C, 50.31 
MHz), unless otherwise noted. Chemical shifts for ~H 
NMR spectra are relative to internal MeaSi or to resid- 
ual protium 3 in the deuterated solvents (C~D 6, 7.15 
ppm). The C NMR spectra were run with H decou- 
piing and the chemical shifts are reported in ppm vs. 
Me4Si (C6D 6 at 128.0 ppm). Melting points were ob- 
tained on a Mel-Temp II apparatus and were not cor- 
rected. Elemental analyses were performed by Texas 
Analytical Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX. 
Fluorene (c13nl0) , nButi (1.6 M solution in hex- 
anes), TiC14, ZrCI 4 and HfC14 were obtained from 
Aldrich and used as received. TiCI4(THF) 2 was pre- 
pared according to literature method [34]. The 
C1CH2Si(Me)2N(H)CMe 3 was synthesized from 
Me3CNH 2 and CICH2Si(Me)2CI as described for the 
related species, purified by vacuum distillation and used 
immediately in the synthesis of t [35,36].

Fluorene (2.0 g, 12.0 mmol) in thf (20 ml) was 
cooled to 0°C and treated with ~ BuLi in hexane (7.5 ml 
of 1.6 M solution, 12.0 mmol) over a period of 15 min. 
The color of the solution became red immediately. The 
solution was then allowed to warm up to room tempera- 
ture and stirred for further 30 min. This mixture was 
added dropwise into CICH2Si(Me)2N(H)CMe 3 (1.08 g, 
6.0 mmol, 20 ml) in THF (20 ml) at 0°C, allowed to 
warm up to room temperature and stirred overnight. All 
of the volatiles were removed under vacuum and the 
residue was extracted into toluene. The mixture was 
filtered and the toluene was removed from the filtrate to 
obtain a red solid. This red solid was rinsed several 
times with hexane and dried under vacuum to obtain 1 
in 67% yield. The product was recrystallized from 
toluene-hexane at -25°C. m.p. 105-108°C. ~H 8=

2.5. X-ray structure determination of 1 
X-ray quality crystals of 1 were obtained by slow 
crystallization from toluene-hexane at -25°C. A suit- 
able crystal was selected and mounted under nitrogen in 
a Lindemann capillary on a goniometer head and trans- 
ferred to the goniostat of an Enraf-Nonius CAD 4 
diffractometer. The unit cell parameters were deter- 
mined by least-squares refinement of 25 reflections. 
Data were collected at room temperature. Three stand- 
ard reflections were measured at every 3600 s of expo- 
sure time to check for crystal ~deterioration and/or 
misalignment. No significant deterioration in intensity 
was observed. Data were corrected for Lorentz and 
polarization effects, but not for absorption. The struc- 
ture was solved by direct methods (SHELX 86) [37]. 
Anisotropic refinement was carried out by full-matrix 
least-squares on F. All non-hydrogen atoms with the 
exception of the carbons in the 5-membered ring and Li 
were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The 
H on the nitrogen was located on the difference map, 
and the remaining hydrogen atoms were included in the 
model at calculated position (U(H)= 1.3 [U(C)]). Re- 
finement converged at R = 0.0546, Rw - 0.0526 (w - 
[O.04F z + (o'F)2] -1 ) [38]. Further details of the crystal 
structure are provided in the supplementary material. 
2.6. X-ray structure determination of 4 
Crystals of 4 were obtained by slow crystallization 
from toluene-hexane at -25°C. A suitable crystal was 
selected and mounted under nitrogen in a Lindemann 
capillary on a goniometer head and transferred to the 
goniostat of an Enraf-Nonius CAD 4 diffractometer. 
The unit cell parameters were determined by least- 
squares refinement of 25 reflections. Data were col- 
lected at room temperature. Three standard reflections 
were measured at every 3600 s of exposure time to 
check for crystal deterioration and/or misalignment. No 
significant deterioration in intensity was observed. Data 
were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, and 
a Fourier absorption correction was applied. The struc- 
ture was solved by Patterson methods. Anisotropic re- 
finement was carried out by full-matrix least-squares for 
all the non-hydrogen atoms, and hydrogen atoms were 
included in the model at calculated position (U(H) = 1.3 
[U(C)]). Refinement on F converged at R = 0.0268, 
Rw = 0.0317 (w -- [0.04F 2 + (ofF)2] -1) [38]. Further 
details of the crystal structure are available in the 
supplementary material. 2. 7. X-ray structure determination of 5 
Crystals of 5 were obtained by slow crystallization 
from toluene-hexane at -25°C. The crystals were re- 
moved from the Schlenk tube under nitrogen and imme- 
diately covered with a layer of hydrocarbon oil. A 
suitable crystal was selected and attached to a glass 
fiber and immediately placed in the low temperature 
nitrogen stream of the Siemens P4 diffractometer with a 
LT-2A device [39]. The unit cell parameters were deter- 
mined by least-squares refinement of 50 reflections. 
Data were collected at -80°C. Three standard reflec- 
tions were measured at every 97 data points to check for 
crystal deterioration and/or misalignment. No signifi- 
cant deterioration in intensity was observed. Data were 
corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, and an 
empirical absorption correction was applied [40]. The 
structure was solved by direct methods. All the non-hy- 
drogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydro- 
gen atoms were included in the refinement at calculated 
position (U(H)= 1.2 [U(C)]). Refinement on F con- 
verged at R = 0.0212, Rw = 0.0212; [w = 1/o'2(F)]. 
All the software programs and the sources of scattering 
factors are contained in the SHELXTL PC (Version 4.2) 
software package provided by Siemens Analytical X-ray 
Instruments, Inc. [41]. Further details of the crystal 
structure are available in the supplementary material. 
3. Results and discussion 
The monolithium complex of the amido-fluorenyl 
ligand, [{MeaCN(H)Si(Me)2CH2-C13H8}Li(THF)] (1) 
was prepared in 67% yield by the treatment of 
Me3CN(H)SiMe2CH2CI with two equivalents of fluo- 
renyllithium in THF (Scheme 1). This compound has 
been isolated as a red solid and characterized by 1n, 13C 
NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. These data 
also show the presence of one molecule of THF for 
each Li atom in 1. The 1H NMR signals due to the THF 
appear as two multiplets around 1.01 and 2.48 ppm. 
This somewhat upfield shift may be due to the shielding 
effects of fluorenyl ring current [25]. Compound 1 could 
be stored under dry nitrogen (preferably at -25°C) 
without any apparent decomposition. 
[{MeaCNSi(Me)2CH2-ClaHs}]Li 2 2 was prepared 
by the addition of one equivalent of n BuLi to 1 in 
toluene and used directly in the preparation of Group 4 
metal complexes (Scheme 1). The treatment of 2 with 
an equivalent of ZiCl4(ZnF) 2 at low temperature led to 
dark green, air and moisture sensitive crystals of [{(r/i- 
NCMe3)Si(Me)2CH2('qs-ClaHs)}TiC12] (3). Com- 
pounds [{(,/1-NCMea)Si(Me)2CH 2(r/5-C 13 H s)}ZrC1 z ] 
(4) and [{(,/1-NCMe3)Si(Me)2CH2(~75-C13H8)}HfC12] 
(5) were prepared in Et20 by treating 2 with the

corresponding metal(IV) chloride, and isolated as dark 
yellow crystals in 75 and 81% yield respectively. 
Compounds 3-5 were characterized by elemental 
analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. All three 
complexes show similar spectra with only minor differ- 
ences in the chemical shift values, suggestin~ closely 
related structures in solution. However, the H NMR 
chemical shift values of tBu and fluorenyl hydrogens of 
3, 4 and 5 show significant differences when compared 
to the corresponding signals of 1. For example, the tBu 
hydrogens of 4 appear about 0.6 ppm downfield from 
that of 1. The 1H NMR signals due to the fluorenyl 
hydrogens of 4 are spread over a relatively narrow 
region of about 0.6 ppm, whereas in 1, the spread is 
much wider (1.3 ppm). 
The NMR and elemental analysis data of 3-5 show 
no evidence for the presence of solvent molecules or 
LiCI coordinated to the metal center. It is notable that 
the related alkoxy-fluorenyl Zr(IV) complexes, {(75- 
C13Ha)CHR-CHR-O}ZrCI2(THF)2 (6)(where CHR- 
CHR = cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl) have been isolated as 
bis-tetrahydrofuran adducts [21]. The attempted synthe- 
sis of THF free 6 using CH2C12 has resulted in prod- 
ucts which contain one equivalent of LiCI or NaCI. The 
dimethylsilylene bridged amido-fluorenyl complex 
[{(r/1-NCMe3)SiMe2('05-C13Hs)}ZrCI2] (7) has been 
synthesized and characterized as its Et20 or THF coor- 
dinated species [25]. The loss of coordinated solvent 
from this compound results in the formation of 
oligomeric or polymeric solids which are insoluble even 
in hot THF. In contrast, compounds 3-5 show excellent 
solubility in Et20, THF, toluene or benzene. The rela- 
tively low coordination number in complexes 3, 4 or 5 
is probably an indication of increased crowding around 
the central metal ion. The increased bulk of the amido- 
fluorenyl ligand, [{(NCMe3)Si(Me)2CH2(C13H8)}] 2-, may be due to a combination of effects of having a 
sterically demanding t-butylamido group and a relaxed 
ligand backbone. 
3.1. Structural descriptions 
Compound 1 crystallizes easily from toluene at 
- 20°C. The structure of 1 has been confirmed by X-ray 
crystallography. A summary of crystal data, selected 
bond lengths and angles and atomic positional parame- 
ters are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
Compound 1 adopts a monomeric structure (Fig. 1) 
in which the lithium atom is coordinated to the THF 
oxygen (Li-O distance of 1.85 (1) .~), nitrogen (Li-N 
distance of 2.16(1) ,~) and to the fluorenyl group in a 
~72-fashion (Li-C distances of 2.28(1) and 2.31(1) ,~). 
The remaining Li-C(fluorenyl) distances are 2.62, 2.68 
and 2.87 A, and thus are not indicative of any interac- 
tion. The Li-O distance is relatively short, indicating a 
strong interaction between the two centers [42-44]. The 
amino nitrogen center is pyramidal as expected. 
The X-ray crystal structures of 4 and 5 have been 
determined to examine the structural effects of the 
dimethylsilylmethylene ligand backbone. The ORTEP 
diagrams of 4 and 5 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 
respectively [45]. The Zr and the Hf compounds are 
essentially isostructural. The summary of crystal data 
for 4 and 5 are listed in Table 1, and selected bond 
lengths and angles and atomic parameters are listed in 
Tables 4 and 5. 
In 4, the Zr atom adopts a formal octahedral struc- 
ture, being coordinated in an r/5-fashion to the fluorenyl 
ring (Zr to C distances range from 2.430(5) to 2.587(4) 
A), the nitrogen and two chlorines [46,47]. The nitrogen 
atom adopts a planar geometry. The Zr-N bond dis- 
tance is 2.060 (3) A. This distance is slightly shorter

relatively unstrained ligand backbone in 4. The structure 
of 4 also shows that the t Bu group is directed more 
towards the open face of the metal complex, providing 
increased protection to the Zr center. 
The cell dimensions and the structural features of 
[{(r/1-NCMea)Si(Me)2CH2(~'/5-C13H8)}HfC12] (5) are 
very similar to those of the zirconium analog, 4. Such 
close similarities between the zirconium and hafnium 
species have been observed previously [55,56]. As in 4, 
compound 5 exists as discrete molecules in the solid 
state. Fig. 4 shows the orientation of the t-butyl group 
on nitrogen with respect to the two chlorine atoms. 
The bond distances between the Hf to carbons of the 
five membered ring in the fluorene group (2.430(5) to 
2.607(5) ,~) suggest ~75-coordination [55,57]. The Hf-N 
distance 2.065(3) is somewhat longer than that found in 
[(r/5-C5 Mes)Hf(H)NHMe] (2.027(8) A) but much closer 5 to the distances found in [(7/-CsMes)I-If{NH(2,6- 
ipr2C6H3)}3] (2.041(4), 2.048(4), and 2.065(3) .~) or 
[HfCI{N(SiMe3)2} 3] (2.040(102 A) [58-60]. The Hf-C1 
distances (2.396(1), 2.399(1) A) may be compared with 
the values of 2.510(1) ,~ in [MeEC(r/5-CsH4)2Hf(r/5- 
CsHs)CI]~, 2.42 ~, in [(CH2)3(r/5-CsH4)2HfCI2] and 
2.436(5) A in [HfCI{N(SiMe3)2} 3] [56,60,61]. 
In conclusion, we have reported the synthesis of an 
amido-fluorenyl ligand system and its utility in the 
synthesis and isolation of solvent free, monomeric Group 
4 metal dichloro complexes. The longer -CH2Si(Me) E- 
bridge increases the effectiveness of the protection of- 
fered by the ligand to the metal ion. The X-ray struc- 
tures of 4 and 5 also represent rare examples of 
mono(fluorenyl) complexes of Group 4 metal ions [25]. 
The Group 4 metal complexes based on this amido-fluo- 
renyl ligand could be useful as catalyst precursors in the 
olefin polymerization reactions [26-30]. We are cur- 
rently studying the chemistry of 3-5, and the reactions 
of 2 with various other metal ions. We are also cur- 
rently investigating the chemistry of [{(N-ipr)Si(Me)2 - 
CH2(C13Hs)}] 2- ligand [62].
