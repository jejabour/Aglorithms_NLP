Abstract 
Epitaxial thin films of T-MnAl have heen grown on (100) GaAs substrates by pulsed laser deposition. Transmission 
electron microscopy and magnetotmnsport measurements have heen used to determine the microstrucW and magnetic 
properties of the films. High resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the deposited MnAl films have the 
lattice constants of the *r-phase with u0 - 0.264 nm and co - 0.357 nm. Magnetoresistance measurements yield hysteresis 
curves verifying the pexpendicular magnetization of the films and their coexcivities of up to 6.7 kOe.

1. Introduction 
The growth of single crystal ferromagnetic films 
on compound semiconductor substrates offers the 
possibility of integrating magnetic storage media with 
electronic devices. This potential application requires 
the magnetic film to have magnetization perpendicu- 
lar to the film surface, or uniaxial anisotropy. Other 
applications include perpendicular recording media 
and magneto-optic data storage [l]. Ferromagnetic 
+InAl thin films have magnetic properties that 
meet several of these requirements for storage media 
such as the tetragonal crystal structure (CuAu type) 
with strong magnetoclystalline anisotropy which fa- 
vors a c-axis as easy magnetic axis [21. The lattice 
constants of T-M~A~ are a = 0.277 um and c = 0.358 
M-I, and the basal plane of the material matches a/2 
of (100) GaAs substrates. T-MnAI is a metastable 
phase with a Curie temperature of 380°C and bulk 
saturation magnetization of 6.2 kGauss [3]. Other groups have reported the growth of &lnAl 
films with varying quality using different techniques. 
These include epitaxial T-M~A~/A~As/G~As het- 
erostructures by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [4], 
and polycrystalline films by vacuum evaporation [5] 
and by sputtering [6]. However, little work has been 
done on the growth of T-M&U on GaAs substrates 
using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In this study, 
we report the deposition of T-MnAl films on (100) 
GaAs substrates by PLD. PLD technique has several 
advantages over other growth techniques. It is sim- 
ple, versatile, provides stoichiometric transport of the 
target material to the substrate, can use multiple 
targets, and is comparatively inexpensive [7]. Our 
investigations examined the effect of growth and 
annealing temperatures on the crystalline structure 
and magnetotransport properties of the grown films. 
These films were analyzed mainly by high resolution 
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and 
magnetotransport measurements.

2. Experimental 
Thin films of r-MnAl were deposited on GaAs 
(100) semi-insulating substrates. The GaAs sub- 
strates were cleaned using trichloroethylene, acetone, 
methanol, and deionized (DI) water with ultrasonic 
cleaner. After degreasing, the substrates were chemi- 
cally etched with a 7 : 1 : 1 solution of 
H,SO, : H,O, : DI H,O for 5 min. Then, the wafers 
were rinsed in running DI water for about 10 min, 
blown dry with filtered N, gas, and loaded into the 
loadlock immediately. A streaky reflection high en- 
ergy electron diffraction @HEED) pattern was ob- 
tained after the substrate was briefly heated to = 
420°C. 
The target was prepared in our lab by arc melting 
and examined for the magnetic r-phase by X-ray 
diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometer. 
Growth was accomplished by ablating a r-Mn,,Al, 
target (1 cm in diameter) using a 193 mn, 18 ns, ArF 
excimer laser. The laser energy density was deter- 
mined to be 4-5 J/cm* per pulse using target to 
substrate distances varying from 3 to 5 cm. The laser 
repetition rates for deposition were in the range of 
2-10 Hz with 3-4 Hz as a regular setting. Growth 
temperatures of 200 to 440°C were obtained using a 
water cooled, resistive heater. The deposition cham- 
ber base pressure was = 2 X 10m9 Torr maintained 
using a 220 l/s ion pump. During ablation, the 
chamber pressure rose to the 5 X lo-* Torr range. 
Films with thicknesses ranging from 6 to. 40 nm 
were deposited with growth rates of = 0.01 A/pulse. 
After growth, the films were annealed at tempera- 
tures of 250-550°C for 15-60 min. In situ RHEED 
was used to characterize the initial and final deposi- 
tion of the films as well as the films after annealing. 
The deposited films were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction, selected area electron diffraction (SAD), 
high resolution transmission electron microscopy 
(HRTEM), optical microscopy, and magnetotrans- 
port measurements. 
The T-MnAl films were deposited on (100) GaAs 
substrates by three approaches. First, a thin template 
of 1 nm MnAl was deposited at room temperature 
followed by annealing and further deposition at the 
growth temperature. Second, a thick template of 5-6 
nm was deposited and annealed at the growth tem- 
perature followed by further deposition at the same temperature. Third, the entire film was deposited at a 
higher temperature of = 440°C. 
3. Results and discussion 
Generally, films deposited at a lower temperature 
yielded either no RHEED pattern or broad ring 
patterns, indicating amorphous or polycrystalline film 
structures. High-temperature annealing of the low- 
temperature deposited films produced no change in 
the RHEED patterns. However, the microstructures 
of these films indicate that recrystallization may 
have taken place during annealing and did not extend 
to the film surface regions. Therefore, the RHEED 
patterns were not affected by the annealing duration. 
The high temperature deposition approach yielded 
single crystal RHEED patterns. The 440°C grown 
film produced a periodic spotty RHEED pattern, as 
shown in Fig. 1. The single crystal pattern was 
evident from the very start of deposition. Such a 
pattern reveals a defined crystalline structure that 
indicates epitaxial growth. The film surface was 
mirror-like with no discoloration, indicating that no 
oxidation of the grown film had occurred. Auger 
spectroscopy was used initially to verify the proper 
Mn,, Al, stoichiometery for the deposited films. 
Essentially, epitaxial films were obtained by two 
approaches. The first was by depositing a thick 6 nm 
template at 200°C followed by rapid annealing at a 
temperature of 500-550°C for several minutes. Fig. 
2 reveals the microstructure of a film grown by this 
procedure. The film shows an abrupt interface with

an epitaxial region of 6 nm. The horizontal fringes 
display a lattice spacing of 0.357 nm, which corre- 
sponds to the 0.358 nm c-axis of T-MnAl. The 
vertical fringes disp1a.y a lattice spacing of 0.264 nm, 
which is close to the 0.277 nm u-axis of the r-phase. 
These lattice spacing values are comparable to the 
values observed in the bulk r-phase [8]. The HRTEM 
microstructure verifies the predicted epitaxial rela- 
tionship (OOl)MnA.l//(OOl)GaAs, [OlO]MnAl 
//[ 1 lO]GaAs between the grown film and the sub- 
strate. 
The second approach for epitaxial deposition was 
done at higher temperatures followed by in situ 
annealing at the growth temperature. A 12 nm T- 
MnAl thin film was deposited at 42O”C, followed by 
post growth annealin at the same temperature for 1 
h. The film thus obtained was fully epitaxial. This 
approach was confirmed by a 20 nm film deposited 
and annealed for 1 h at 440°C. Fig. 3 shows a SAD 
pattern and the corresponding indexed pattern for 
this film. The diffraction pattern ,is spotty with no 
rings present, indicating an epitsixial structure. The 
diffraction pattern, coupled with the RHEED pattern 
information at the onset of growth, suggests that the 
film was grown epitaxially. 
These results reveals two approaches of obtaining 
epitaxial &inAl thin films on GaAs substrates. The 
first is deposition of an amorphous thick template at 
200°C followed by recrystallization at 500-550°C. 
This approach may be limited by a critical thickness 
for complete recrystallization. The second is high- temperature epitaxial deposition at 440°C followed 
by annealing at the same temperature. This approach 
shows the most promise for integration with semi- 
conductor fabrication. 
Magnetotransport measurements were used to 
evaluate the magnetic contribution of the r-MnAl 
phase in these thin films. By using a Hall measure- 
ment setup we were able to examine the extraordi- 
nary Hall effect (EHE) of our samples. The EHE is 
measured by applying the magnetic field perpendicu- 
lar to the plane of the film, and measuring the 
voltage perpendicular to the applied current. The 
details of this technique are previously described [9]. 
Basically, the EHE arises due to asymmetric scatter- 
:tion

voltage is linearly proportional to the magnetization

Hall-type measurement can be used to reveal the 
perpendicular magnetization in the grown films. 
Measurements were carried out at both room temper- 
ature and a low temperature of 82 K using 4 mm 
square samples with indium contact dots and gold 
leads. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the Hall effect

room temperature for a 40 nm film grown at 240°C 
and annealed at temperatures of 290 and 350°C. At 
room temperature, these films have resistivities of 
140 and 370 p.fi cm, respectively. These resistivities 
are comparable with other reported values [II]. Al- 
though the microstructure of this particular film indi- 
cated polycrystalline nature with average gram size 
of = 47 nm in diameter, the magnetic measurements 
indicate that most of these grams have their magnetic 
easy axis parallel to the growth direction. The hys-

teresis curves indicate that films annealed at higher 
temperatures tend to have in general larger coercivi- 
ties, as summarized in Table 1. 
Like the EHE, the anisotropic magnetoresistance 
(AMR) is also associated with the magnetic state of 
the sample. However, it measures the saturation 
magnetization in the plane of the film. EHE and 
AMR measurements use the same voltage and cur- 
rent configurations, but apply the magnetic field 
differently. Fig. 5 shows the EHE plot (the magnetic 
field is perpendicular to the film surface) and the 
AMR plot (the magnetic field is parallel to the film 
surface) for a 22 nm film measured at 300 K. For a 
perpendicularly applied magnetic field the hysteresis 
loop has a coercivity of 6.7 kOe which is comparable 
to values (6 kGe) observed in MnAl powders [3] and 
well above the best values (< 3 kGe) obtained in 
extruded bulk magnets [12]. When the field is paral- 
lel to the film plane, the hysteretic effect is consider- 
ably diminished. This comparison shows that the 
magnetization component is mainly in the perpendic- 
ular direction of the film rather than in the plane of 
the film. The microstructure of these films indicates 
that the c-axis is mainly oriented perpendicular to the 
film plane. 
4. Conclusions 
Thin films of T-MnAl were successfully grown on 
(100) GaAs substrates by PLLI technique with poly-

crystalline ~44nAl as the target. HRTEM and 
RHEED studies show epitaxial growth of the films 
having lattice constants close to that of bulk values. 
The EHE measurements on these films reveal that 
the magnetization is perpendicular to the film surface 
and that variable coercivity up to 6.7 kOe at room 
temperature can be achieved,
