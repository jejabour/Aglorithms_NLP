Abstract 
Ruthenium-catalyzed step-growth copolymerization of 3',4'-metl'lylenedioxyacetoplaenone and t~.co-dienes such as 1,3-divinyitetra- 
methyldisiloxaae or 3.3.6,6-tetr, nnethyl-3.6-disila-l.7-octadiene give high molecular weight copoly(3,3,5,5-tetramethyi-4-oxa-3.5-disila- 
1,7-heptanylene/2-aceto-4,5-methylenedioxy-l,3-phenylene) or copoly(3.3,6.6-tetramethyl-3,6-disila-l.8-octanylene/2-aceto-4.5-meth- 
ylenedioxy. 1,3-phenylene) respectively. The synthesis and characterization of these copolymers are reported.

I. Introduction 
Murat and cowotkcrs [1 3] have rcpor|ed tlaat dihy- 
th'idocarbonyl tris( triplleny Iphosphine)rulhcilium (Ru) 
catalyzes the addition of the ortho carbonoohydrogcn 
bonds of acetophenone across the carbon-~carbon douo~ 
ble bonds of olefins such as trimethylvinylsilane to 
yield ortho alkyl subslituled acetophenones. We have 
shown that this reaction can be applied to ad,leve 
step-growth copolymerization (co-oligomerizatit,n) of 
aromatic ketones and a,co-dienes [4]. For exawple, 
reaction of divinyidimethyisii,'me and acetophenone cat- 
alyzed by Ru at 150°C yields copoly(3,3-dimethyl-3- 
sila-l,5-pentanylene/2-aceto-l,3-phenylene), Mw/M, 
= 35(X)/2430 in 70% yield. The low molecular weight 
of the copolymer is not unexpected since exact stoi- 
chiometry is essential to achieve high molecular weights 
in step-growth copolymerization reactions. The occur°

stroy Ihc required stoichiometric balance, in this regard, 
we have detected Si,~ethyl end groups by NMR analysis 
of low molccuhu' weight coooligomers prepared by Rw 
catalyzed rcactkn~s between an|hron¢, |°hlOI'C|IOtlc Of 
xanthanone and a a~dienes [5]. Such groups couhl 
arise by hydrogenation of a vinyl group bonded to 
silicon of the ,r,~o°diene. We believe that tile source of 
the hydrosen for this reduction is the catalyst itself. 
Thus, we have found that addition of a stoichiometric 
amount of styrene to the catalyst prior to addition of a 
!: I mixture of the ,acetophenone and ot,to°diene leads 
to a quantitative yield of ethylbenzene and significanlly 
higher molecular weight (Mw/M,, = 30(X)0/2(~IXX~ or 
higher) copolymers [6]. The issue of molecular weight 
is particularly important since the prol~rties of l~ly o 
mers (oligomers) often change significantly until a mino 
imum molecular weight of around I0000 is :~chieved. 
We have also explored the effect of some functional 
groups on this type of step-growth copolymerization. 
Specifically, we have can'ied out successful copolymcr- 
ization of acetophenones bearing methoxy, phenoxy, or 
various dialkyhunino substituents in the para position 
[7,8]. in this paper, we refx~rt the successful Ru-cata o

TGA of the copolymers was carried out with a 
Perkin-Elmer TGS-2 instrument at a nitrogen flow rate 
of 40 cc min- ~. The temperature program for the analy- 
sis was 50°C for 10 min followed by an increase of 4°C 
min-~ to 750°C. 
2.3. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
DSC was utilized to determine the glass transition 
temperatures Tg of the copolymers. These were carried 
out on a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7 instrument. The melting 
points of indium (156°(2) and ice (0°C) were used to 
calibrate the DSC. The temperature program for the 
analysis was -70°C for 10 min followed by an increase 
of 20°C min -~ to 150°C. 
2. Experimental 
~H and t3C NMR spectra were obtained on either a 
Bruker AC-250 or an AM-360 spectrometer operating 
29 in the Fourier transform mode. Si NMR spectra were 
recorded on an IBM Bruker WP-270-SY spectrometer. 
Five per cent weight/volume solutions of copolymer in 
chloroformod were used to obtain NMR spectra. ~C 
NMR spectra were run with broad band proton decou° 
piing. A heteronuelear gated decoupling pulse sequence 
(NONOE) with a 20 s delay was used to acquire Z'~Si 
NMR spectra [9] These were externally referenced to 
TMS. Chloroform was used as an internal standard for 
tH and ~C NMR spectra. IR spectra of neat films on 
NaC! plates were recorded on an IBM FrolR spectrome~ 
ter. UV spectra of cyclohexane solutions wet',,, acquired 
on a Shimadzu UVo260 ultraviolet visible spectrometer. 
2. I, Molecular weight distributions 
Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis of 
the molecular weight distribution of these copolymet~ 
was performed with a Wate~ system cow, i~rising a U6K 
injector, a 510 HPLC solvent delivery system, an R401 
refractive index detector and a model 820 Maxima 
control system. A series of three 7.8 mmx 30 cm 
columns packed with smaller than 10 ~m particles of

All reactions were conducted in flame dried glass- 
ware under purified argon. 3',4'-Methylenedioxyace- 
tophenone was purchased from Aldrich. 1,3-Divinyi- 
tetramethyidisiloxane and 3,3,6,6-tetramethyi-3,6-disila- 
1,7-octadiene were obtained from United Chemical 
Technologies. Dihydridocarbonyl tris(triphenylphos-

flame dried three-necked round-bottomed flask, which 
was equipped with a reflux condenser and a Teflon 
covered magnetic stirring bar. The other two inlets were 
sealed by rubber septa. Ariel" injection of styrene (9 ~l, 
8 rag, 0.008 mmol) by syringe, the flask was heated for 
2 rain at 135°C. A mixture of 3',4'-methylenedioxyaceo 
tophenone (0.66 g, 4 mmoi) and 1,3-divinyltetrameth- 
yldisiloxmle (0.75 g, 4 retool) was then injected into the 
flask using another syringe. The mixture immediately 
turned black. The mixture was kept at 135°C for 16 h 
and the solvent and volatile materials were then re° 
moved by distillation under reduced pressure. The crude 
polymer was purified three times by precipitation from 
tetrahydrofuran and methanol. In this way, 1.23 g. 86%

3. Results and discussion 
These Ru-catalyzed copolymerization reaction me 
quite remarkable in that they involve catalytic Co~ll 
aclivation, a subject of much current interesl. The reac- 
tion ptx~ceeds in a regiospecific anti-Markovnikoff man~ 
net, The hydrogen of the carbon~.hydrogen I~ond which 
is ortho to the activating acetyl group becomes bonded 
tO the mOVe substituted carbon of the vinyl group. We 
have Ibund that the reaction is only successfid with a 
limited number of ~,~o~dienes. The reaction fails with 
a,~o-dienes such as 1,7ooctadiene since the Ru catalyst 
causes isomerization of the terminal carbon=carbon 
double bonds to internal carbon-carbon double bonds 
which are app,'u'ently much less reactive. Silicon pre- 
vents isomerization of the carbon-carbon double bonds 
due to the well known instability of silicon-carbon 
double bonds. However, the effect of silicon is more 
complex. Thus the carbon-carbon double bonds of vinyl 
bromide, vinyl ethers, a,[3.unsaturated esters, or a,[3- 
unsaturated nitriles which cannot undergo isomerization 
also hill to react. On this basis we conclude that the 
effect of the silyl group is both electronic and that it 
blocks the carbon-carbon double bond isomerization. 
Despite our previous success with Ru-catalyzed 
step-growth copolymerization of the p-methoxyace- 
tophenone with 1,3°divinyltetramethyldisiloxane we 
consider the successful copolymerization of 3',4'-meth- 
ylenedioxyacetophenone with 1,3-divinyltetramethyldi- 
siloxane and with 3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,6-disila-l,7-oc- \/ \/

tadiene remarkable. Thus, fi'om a steric point of view it 
is extremely unusual to be able to insert a group be- 
tween two ~roups on a benzene ring which have a 
1,3-relationship. In particular, the insertion of a bulky 
polymer chain between two groups which have a 1,3-re- 
lationship is expected to involve extreme steric de- 
mands. Nevertheless, the copolymerization of ~' ,1' 
methylenedioxyacetophenone with 1,3-divinyitetrameth- 
yidisiloxane or 3,3,6,6-tetrameti~yl*3,6-disila-l,7°oc- 
tadiene with an Ru catalyst which has been previously 
activated by treatment with an equivalent amount of 
styrene proceeds smoothly to give high molecular 
copolymers in excellent yield. 
In both copolymers three different ~'~Si NMR signals 
are observed. These result from the presence of three 
microstructures. In the first, |he mljaccnt 4,5omcthylen~ 
cdioxy units are t lo. c, in the second one is close and 
the other distant, and in the third both are distant (see 
Consistent with tiffs interpretation, three ~C Fig. I). ~ ' ' 
si~,nals for the methyl groups bonded to silicon 
(0.07, 0.13, 0.18 ppm) are detected in the SlXXtrum of 
copoly( 3,3,5 ,5-tetramethyl*4-oxa* 3,5odisilao 1,7ohept:mo 
ylene/2-aceto-4,5-methylenedioxy° 1,3ophenylene). 
Three s~gnals are also observed m the C NMR tot" (,-3 
of the aromatic ring ( 134. ! 0, ! 34.20 and ! 34.46 ppm). 
Similarly, two signals are obsetwed for the benzylic 
methylene carbons of this copolymer. However, only 
single ~C reson:mces due to the methyl groups bonded 
to silicon and to C-3 of the aromatic ring are observed 
in the spectnma of copoly(3,3,6,6*tetramethyl-3,6-disila- 
! ,8-octanylene/2-aceto-4,5*methylenedioxy-1,3-phen- 
ylene). In this latter copolymer, the benzylic and methy- 
lene carbons adjacent to silicon each give rise to two 
signals. The reason for this difference between the two 
copolymers is not ,apparent. 
These copolymers are quite stable as determined by 
TGA. For example, copoly(3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-4-oxa* 
3,5-disila* 1,7-heptanylene/2-aceto-4,5-methylenedioxyo 

354 G. Wang et al./ Journal of Organometallie Chemistry 521 (1996) 351-354 
1.3-phenylene) is thermally stable to 270°C. Between 
270 and 350°C slow thermal decomposition occurs. 
Above 350°C more rapid weight loss is observed. Above 
550°C a significant residue (around 45%) is found.
