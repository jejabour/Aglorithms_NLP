Abstract 
Complexes [(~s-CsHMe4)2Ti(T/t-C-ffiCSiMe3)2]-M+ (M - Li (2), Na (3), K (4) and Cs ($)) were prepared by the redox reaction of 
(!qS-CsHMe4)2Ti('rf-C-CSiMe3)2 (1) with the alkali metals in toluene. The X-ray crystal analysis of 4 (monoclinic, P2t/c, 
a "= 10.888(3), b - 18.047(8), c -- 16.562(3) ~,,/3 ,- 104.10(2) °, Z - 4) revealed a tweezer structure with the potassium cation embedded 
between the trimethylsilylacetylide tweezer arms in a position which is slightly closer to the inner acetylide carbon atoms (2.946(4) and 
2.949(4) ~,) than to the outer ones (3.021(4) and 2.961(4) ~). The K + ion simultaneously binds a CsHMe4 ligand of the adjacent 
molecule at the K-centroid distance of 3.186(5) ~,, thus forming a polymer chain arrangement of molecular units. The complexes 2-$ 
afford characteristic EPR spectra (g-- 1.9924-1.9935, AH-2.0-2.4 G, arj-7.8-8.4 G), IR (~,(C-C) at 1935-1948 cm -I) and 
UV-vis spectra (two CT bands in the region 355-390 nm). The molecular ions of 2-$ were observed in E! mass spectra.

1. Introduction 
The first titanocene Ti(lll) tweezer complex [(~s. 
Cs HMe4)2Ti(~ I-CRCSiMe~)2 ]~ [Mg(THF)CI] + has 
been obtained by a cleavage of 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyi)- 
buta- 1,3-diyne in the (Cs HMe4)2 TiCI 2/Mg/THF sys- 
tem [!]. Permethylated titanocene-magnesium tweezer 
complexes of this type were found to be the catalyst 
intermediates in the well known head-to-tail dimeriza- 
tion of I-alkynes [2]. Recently, the first alkali metal 
Ti(lll) tweezer complex [(~S-CsHMe4)2Ti(T/I- 
Cffi-CC=SiMe3)2]-[Li(THF) 2]+ has been synthesized 
from (CsHMe4)2TiC! by adding two equivalents of 
LiCtCCDCSiMe3 in THF solution [3]. The Li + ion 
coordinating two molecules of THF was situated close 
to the inner carbon atoms of the inner pair of triple 
bonds. Alkali metal tweezer complexes of this stnxctural 
type have so far been described for permethylmetal- 
locene derivatives of lanthanide elements Y [4], Sm, Nd

SSDI 0022-328X(95)06041-3 and Ce [5]. It has to be mentioned that, amongst a large 
number of titanocene Ti(IV) tweezer complexes, no 
alkali metal complexes have so far been reported [6], 
although the complexes with embedded Group I B met- 
als Cu [7,8] and Ag [9] are known. 
Here we report the synthesis of alkali metal Ti(lll) 
tweezer complexes [(~/s-CsHMe4)2Ti(y/I-CmCSi- 
Me3)2]-M + (M,=Li, Na, K, Cs) from the Ti(IV) 
diacetylide (~/S-CsHMe4)2Ti(~lt-CmCSiMe3) 2 (I) and 
alkali metals in toluene or THF and the crystal structure 
of the potassium.containing complex. 
2. Experimental details 
All manipulations with reagents, the synthesis, and 
most of the spectroscopic measurements were carried 
out under vacuum using all-sealed glass devices 
equipped with breakable seals. The adjustment of single 
crystals into capillaries for X-ray analysis, preparation 
of KBr pellets and filling of infrared cuvettes were 
performed in an atmosphere of purified nitrogen or 
argon.

2.1. Chemicals 
The solvents toluene, hexane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) 
and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) were purified by 
conventional methods, dried by refluxing over LiAIH4 
and stored as solutions of the dimeric dtanocene (CtoH s) 
[(CsHs)Ti( p-H)~ [10], Butyllithium (BuLl) in hexane 
(1.6 M) was obtained from Aldrich. (CsHMe4)2TiC! 
was prepared from (CsHMe4)2TiCI2 in toluene by 
adding one equivalent of BuLl. Trimethylsilylethyne 
(Aldrich) was degassed and distilled onto a small amount 
of dimeric titanocene. After standing overnight the solu- 
tion was degassed and trimethylsilylethyne was distilled 
into a storage ampoule under metal valve. 
2.2. Methods 
EPR spectra were recorded on an ERS-220 spectrom- 
eter (Centre for Production of Scientific Instruments, 
Academy of Sciences, Berlin, Germany) in the X-band; 
g values were determined using an Mn 2+ (M t = - I/2 
line) standard at g - 1.9860 and a proton magnetometer 
MJ-110 R (Radiopan, Poznan, Poland). Concentrations 
of the paramagnetic compounds were estimated from 
integrated first derivation spectra. A variable tempera- 
ture unit STT-3 was used for measurements in the range 
- 140 to + 2(PC. Samples were measured as solutions 
in hexane, THF, toluene and MTHF. The toluene and 
MTHF solutions were used for the measurement of 
anisotropic spectra in frozen organic glasses, UV-vis 
spectra in the range 280-2000 nm were obtained on a 
Varian Car), 17D spectrometer using all-sealed quartz 
cuvettes (Hellma), Mass ~,,~ctra were measured on a 
JEOL D.100 spectrometer at 70 eV (only important 
mass peaks and peaks of intensity t,ot below 5% are 
reported), Samples in capillaries were opened and in- 
serted into the direct inlet under argon, Infrared spectra 
were recorded on a UR-75 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Hexane or toluene solutions were filled into KBr cu- 
vettes under argon; regions 2800-3000 and ! 400-1550 
cm-i were overlaid by strong absorption bands of the 
solvents. ~H and S3C NMR spectra were measured on a 
Varian VXR-400 spectrometer (400 and 100 MHz re- 
spectively) in CeD e at 25°C, Samples were referenced 
to residual benzene as internal standard, 6 e 7.15 and 
8 c 128,00 ppm respectively. 
2.3. Preparation of (?I S'C5 HMe 4 )2 Ti(~ l-C -- CSiMe 3 )z 
(1) 
Trimethyisilylethyne (0.6 mi, 4 mmol) and toluene 
(60 mi) were distilled into the reaction vessel and BuLl 
(I.6 M, 2.5 ml) in hexane was added. After stirring 
overnight the obtained solution of LiCmCSiMe 3 [11] 
was mixed with the solution of (CsHMe4)aTiCI 2 (0,65 
g, 2 mmol) in 30 ml of toluene and stirred for 2 h, Then 
the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuum and the 
residue was extracted with hexane, The orange-yellow 
solution was separated from a white sediment of LiCi. 
The solution was kept at - 18°C for two days and then 
a clear intense yellow solution was carefully separated 
from an additional sediment. The hexane was evapo- 
rated in vacuum to leave an orange-yellow waxy solid 
of I. Yield 0.71 g (82%1. WARNING: 1, and its solu-

2.4. Preparation of [(~I~-CsHMe4)zTi(~I.C=CSi - 
Me3)z I - M + (M -- Li, Na, K, Cs) (2-5) from I and 
alkali metals in toluene 
The solution of 1 in toluene (! mmoi in 25 ml) was 
added to excess alkaii metals (freshly cut pieces ef 
Li-K or fine drops of Cs) in vacuum. The mixture was 
gently stirred by a glass-coated magnetic stirrer bar. The 
reaction time ranged from 1 h for Cs to two weeks for 
Li. The true reaction times were usually shorter than 
those given below for particular complexes because the 
reaction mixtures were worked up only after it was 
certain that all 1 had been consumed. The absence of 1 
in the reaction mixture was checked by IR spectra 
(absence of band at 2017 cm-I). The isolation proce- 
dures for particular complexes mtd their characteristics 
are described below. The data of EPR and UV-vis 
spectra are collected in Table 1. The g and aTi values 
for the hexane and toluene and THF and MTHF solu- 
tions were identical within the accuracy of the determi- 
nation. 
2.4.1. [(~5-Cs HMe4 )zTi(~lt-C- SiMej )z ] - [Li] + (2) 
After a reaction time of two weeks a brown reaction 
solution was separated from the pieces of Li metal and 
was evaporated in vacua. The residue was extracted by 
hexane to give an orange-brown solution. The saturated 
solution yielded a crop of brown crystals. The crystal- 
lization was repeated with partly evaporated mother 
liquor and the combined crops were recrystallized from 
hexane. The first crop was used for the characterization 
and spectroscopic measurements. Total yield of brown 
crystalline 2 was 0.42 g (86%).

After a reaction time of five days the solution was 
separated from a remainder of sodium metal and was 
evaporated in vacua. The residue was extracted with 
repeatedly used 20 ml of hexane to give brown solid of 
3 and a saturated solution. The solid was dissolved in 
toluene to give a brown solution. Crystalline 3 was 
obtained from saturated toluene solution by cooling. 
Yield of brown crystalline product was 0.47 g (93%). 
Rec~stall;zation from 50 ml of hexane afforded metal- 
lie blue crystals; they were soluble both in hexane and 
in toluene to give brown solutions.

After 3 h reaction time the solution was separated 
from potassium metal and was evaporated in vacua. The 
residue was extracted with 20 ml of hexane and the 
extract was separated and discarded. The residue was 
extracted by toluene to give a brown solution. The 
saturated toluene solution yielded brown crystals of 4 
by cooling in a refrigerator overnight. Yield 0.44 g 
(85%). Occasionally, blue crystals were also obtained 
which dissolved in toluene to give the brown solution.

After 1 h reaction time a large amount of a black 
sediment was formed in the system. A light brown 
solution was poured away from the sediment and was 
discarded. The sediment was repeatedly extracted by 30 
ml of toluene until the light brown colour of the extracts 
faded. The soluble material obtained from the sediment 
was dissolved in hot toluene and was slowly cooled to 
room temperature. Grey needles of metallic appearance 
were obtained in the yield of 0.24 g (40%).

The reactions of I with alkali metals were carried out 
in the same way as described above except that toluene 
was replaced on a vacuum line by THF. The reaction 
was generally completed in shorter times, e.g. for Li in 
one day. The workup always began by evaporating THF 
in vacua and extracting the residue by hexane.

Compound 2a was obtained as fine brownish-green 
crystals by cooling of the saturated hexane solution to

coordinated THF. Three-times repeated dissolution of 
2a in toluene and evaporation of the solvent in vacuo

products obtained with the other metals were 
losing a coordinated THF more easily. Compound 3a 
contained ~ after evaporation of solvents in vacuo. 
but its extract in hexane showed IR absorption bands of 
both coordinated (1053 cm -I) and free (1075 cm -j) 
THF in comparable intensifies. After evaporating the 
solvent and dissolving the residue in toluene, only a 
weak absorption band of free THF was observed. Evap- 
oration of the solvent afforded 3. Most of the coordi- 
nated THF wa~ evolved from 4a and Sa by evacuation. 
The subsequent washing of the remainders with hexane 
afforded 4 and $. The yields of compounds 2-5 pre- 
pared via 2a-$a did not differ from the yields obtained 
in toluene. Reversely, compounds 2a-Sa were obtained 
by dissolving 2-5 in THF, and their EPR and UV-vis 
spectra are given in Table ! (as listed for the MTHF 
solven0. 
2.6. Preparation of 2 from (C~HMe4)zTiCI and

The solution of BuLi in hexane (I.6 M, 1.3 ml) was 
added to (CsHMe4)2TiCi 2 (0.65 g, 2 mmol) in 30 ml of 
toluene and the mixture was warmed to 50°C to give a 
blue solution, BuLl in hexane (I,6 M, 2,5 ml) was 
mixed with tHmethylsilylethyne (0.6 ml, 4 retool) in 
toluene (60 ml) and the mixture was stirred overnight. 
The blue reaction mixture containing (CsHMe4)2TiCI 
was added to a yellow slurry containing LiC-CSiMes 
and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at ambient tempera- 
ture. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the 
residue was worked up as above. Yield of crystalline 2 
was 0.41 g (85%),

A dark brown crystal fragment 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 mm 3 
was mounted in a glass capillary under purifi:A nitrogen 
in a glovebox (Braun) and was sealed by wax. The 
X-ray measurements were carried out on a Phillips PW

The titanocene (Ti m) diacetylide (tweezer) alkali 
metal complexes of the type [(CsHMe4)2Ti(~'-CmCSi- 
Me x)2]-[M] + were easily obtained by the redox reac- 
tion between bis(tetramethyicyclopentadienyl)tita-

Compounds 2-4 were obtained in high yields (70-90%);

also obtained in high yield by the dismutation reaction

(2) All compounds form crystalline materials from the 
hexane or toluene solutions. Their solubility decreases 
from Li to Cs: whereas 2 is highly soluble in hexane, $ 
dissolves only slightly in toluene. All compounds are 
thermally robust as they evaporate without decomposi- 
tion in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer from 
120°C for 2 to 220°C for 5. Their MS spectra show the 
molecular ions corresponding to formulae 2-5 and the 
ions of alkali metals. The other fragment ions 
[(CsHMe4)2Ti(C--CSiMe3)] +, [(CsHMe4)2Ti] + ahd 
ions probably from diyne (C--CSiMe3) 2 were practi- 
cally identical for all the compounds. The EPR, UV-vis 
and IR spectra of all compounds showed features simi- 
lar to those of [(CsHMe4)2Ti('r/t-C--CSiMe3)2]-[Mg - 
(THF)CI] + (6) [1] and [(CsHMe4)2Ti(@s-C--CC--CSi - 
Me3)2]-[Li(THF)2] + (7) [3], the only structurally char- 
acterized Ti (Ill) tweezer complexes (vide infra). The 
X-ray single crystal analysis of 4 confirmed the tweezer 
structure with a potassium cation embedded between the 
trimethylsilylethynyl tweezer arms. 
3.2. Crystal structure of 4 
The PLUTO drawing of 4 with atom numbering scheme 
is shown in Fig. I and selected bond distances and bond 
angles are listed in Table 3. They demonstrate that the 
molecular structure of 4 is asymmetric in all parts. The 
titanocene moiety has the T/5-CsHMe4 ligands in an 
irregularly staggered conformation, with the proton 
bearing ring atoms C(15) and C(20) close to positions 
where the ligands approach each other. The CE(I)-Ti- 
CE (2) [CE (I)-centroid for the C(I !)-C(15) ring; CE 
(2)-centroid for the C(16)-C(20)ring] angle amounts to 
136.9(2) °. This value is very close to that found for 7

(136.2(2) °) [3]. The CE(I), Ti, CE(2) plane is perpen- 
dicular to the tweezer plane defined by the atoms of 
tweezer bite angle C(I)-Ti-C(6). The bite angle is 
90.1(1) °, virtually the same as that in 7 (89.9(2)°). The 
Ti-C distances for the acetylide groups (av. 2.146(4) ,~) 
are slightly shorter than in the Mg complex 6 (av. 2.165 
~). The C--C bonds have approximately the same 
~ ngth in both compounds (av. 1.229(4) against 1.22(1) 
). Both ~ters are, however, slighdy shoi~er in the 
di~ complex 7. The tweezer arms exert a mutually 
different outwards bending from an approximately lin- 
ear structure (Table 3). The tweezer plane contains the 
acetylide atoms C(2) and C(7) within 0.005 ,~, however, 
the K + ion is placed 0.363 ~ away on the side contain- 
ing CT~ I), whereas the Si(I) atom is 0.149 A and the Si 
(2) atom 0.014 ~ away on the other side of the plane. 
The potassium ion is located between the acetylide re'ms 
in a position which is negligibly closer to the inner 
acetylide carbon atoms (2.946(4) and 2.949(4) ,~) th~n 
to the outer ores (3.021(4) and 2.961(4) ,~). The K-C 
distances close to 3.00 ~ are longer by ca. 0.2 ~ than 
the sum of the covalent radii of both atoms, 2.03 and 
0.77 ~. The Ti-K distance of 4.033 (It ~ does not 
imply any intermetallic interaction. 
The distortion of the molecule seems to be brought 
about by a polymeric nature of the compound in the 
solid state, as is shown on a dimer fragment of the 
molecular chain (Fig. 2). The molecules are mutually 
bonded by a weak coordination of a cyciopentadienyl 
ring (CE(I)) to K ° of the adjacent molecule. The mode 
of coordination formally resembles an ~S-mode, how- 
ever, distances of ring carbon atoms to K' differ consid- 
erably from the shortest K'=C(I I) (3.078(5) ,~) and 
K'-C(15) (3.112(5) ~) to the longest K'-(CI3) 
(3,741(5) ~), The average value K'-C~ is 3.394(5) ~. 
The K°=CE(i) distance of 3,186(5) ,~ is only longer by 
0.2 ~ than the average distance from the potassium ion 
to acetylide carbon atoms, The zig-zag structure of the 
polymer chain follows from the angles Ti-K°-Ti ' 
(151,7 °) and K-Ti-K' (128,2°). The Ti-CE(I)-K ° an- 
gle is 155,70, 
A very similar polymer arrangement of molecular 
Fig, 2, eLLreo diqram showing the polymeric structure of 
[(Cs HMe~)~Ti(nI-C~SiMe~)z ] [KI" (4), units was previously found in [(CsMes)2Sm(T/l- 
C-CPh)2K],, [5]. The distances between K + and car- 
bon atoms of the CsMe 5 ring of the adjacent molecule 
varied over the range 2.922(57-3.229 (6) A to give an 
average value K'-Cav of 3.08 (13) A. The K'- 
CE(CsMes)-Sm angle was close to linear (171.6°). The 
comparison of these intermolecular parameters with 
those of 4 shows that the phenyl substituems at tweezer 
arms do not hinder the contacts between the potassium 
ion and the adjacent cyclopentadienyl ring as severely 
as the trimethylsilyl groups in 4. 
3.3. The synthesis of l(CsHMe4)aTi(171-C-CSi - 
Mej)aI-ILi(THF),i + (n < 2) (2a) and 2-5 in THF 
The reaction (I) also proceeded in THF to give 
compounds 2-5 containing up to two equivalents of 
coordinated THF (Eq. (3)). 
(CsHMe4)2Ti(~) t- C=-CSiMe3)2 + M 
Tee [(CsHMe4)2Ti(T/, - C_CSiMe3)2 ] - 
[M(THF),)] + 
[n ~ 2; M- Li(2a), Ha(3a), K(4a), Cs($a)] 
(3) 
The limit of n - 2 for the number of coordinated THF 
molecules corresponds to the maximum coordination of 
four ligands around Li +. This upper limit was achieved 
in 7 [3]. Compounds 2a-$a were of limited stability and 
lost THF with increasing ease on going from 2a to $a. 
The workup of the reaction mixtures, consisting of the 
evaporation of THF in vacuo and extracting the residue 
with hexane, led to a partial decomposition of 3a and a 
complete decomposition of 4a and $a, In this way 
compounds 4 and 5 were obtained in yields similar to 
those obtained in toluene (vide supra). Compound 3 was 
obtained after evaporation of the toluene solution of 3a 
in vacuo. Only compound 2a was isolated as a brown- 
ish-green crystalline solid from the hexane solution at 
-15°C. The content of THF in 2a has not yet been 
determined: it crystallizes from hexane probably with 
one or two molecules of THF coordinated to the Li + 
ion. Both cases of the THF coordination are known in 
(C~Me.~)2Y(CmCCMe~)2Li(THF) [5] and 7 [3] respec- 
tively. The presence of compounds 2a-Sa in THF 
solutions was proven by electronic absorption spectra, 
which differed from those of 2-5 in toluene in the 
region 1000-500 nm (vide infra). A remarkable effi- 
ciency of toluene in liberating THF from the complexes 
may result from the solvation of alkali metal cations by 
toluene, mimicking the coordination of CsHMe 4 ligand 
in the solid state.

3.4. Spectroscopic characterization of 2-5 and their 
THF adducts 
The EPR spectra showed a narrow single line (AH - 
2,0-2.2 G) at g ffi 1.9924-1.9935, and much weaker 
satellite spectra reflecting the coupling to the 49Ti and 
47Ti isotopes (natural abundances 5.5% and 7.7%) with 
nuclear spins I N ffi 7/2 and I N =- 5/2 respectively. The 
value of the g-factor is one of the highest values for 
titanocene derivatives, comparable with that for 
(CsHMe4)2Ti(l-methyl-vl3-allyl) with g- 1.9921 [13]. 
The g-tensor of rhombic symmetry shows nearly equal 
components and a very low anisotropy (Table 1), and 
this is a rare case amongst titanocene Ti(III) derivatives 
[14]. It indicates a considerable delocalization of the d' 
unpaired elecu~n density over the organic ligands, in- 
cluding the acetylide arms. The coupling constant art 
(equal for both isotopes) ranges from 7.8 to 8.4 G. A 
higher value of the g-factor (1.9940) and a lower value 
of aTi (7.5 G) were observed in [(CsHMe4)2Ti(v/'- 
C-CC-CSiMe3)2]-[Li(THF)2]+, probably as a result 
of the higher delocalization capability of the diyne 
arms. The interaction of the unpaired electron with 
alkali metal was observed only for the Cs + nucleus 
(! N = 7/2) in $, both in toluene and MTHF. The 
AH(peak-to.peak) of the central signal was the same in 
both the solvents, but the resolution into an eight-line 
spectrum with acs ffi 2.0 G was obtained in MTHF. The 
nature of the solvents affected the EPR spectra of all the 
compounds only slightly. The g-factor values were 
generally lower and aTl was negligibly higher in MTHF 
compared with toluene. 
The electronic absorption spectra of 2-$ both in 
toluene and in THF or MTHF were characterized by a 
couple of very intense absorption bands in the range 
350-390 nm (Table I). Orange-brown toluene solu- 
tions of 2-4 further showed a broad absorption increas- 
ing in intensity from about 720 nm to shorter wave- 
lengths. Poorly discernible shoulders were observed for 
3 and 4 near 500 nm, whereas the absorption band for 2 
was observed at 460 nm. Compound $ was only slightly 
soluble in toluene and thus the low-intensity part of the 
spectrum (750-500 nm) did not show any other feature 
except a weak absorption increasing towards short 
wavelengths. In THF or MTHF their colours turned to a 
much less intense green-yellow. The solutions showed 
a very weak absorption, growing in intensity to shorter 
wavelengths from ca. 1000 nm. All compounds exerted 
a broad shoulder in the region 740-770 nm, and an 
absorption band at 560-580 nm which should indicate 
the presence of compounds 2a-Ba in THF solutions. 
The intense bands below 400 nm were recently assigned 
to a d -~ 9" transition [3], whereas the longest wave- 
length absorption band at 700 nm should belong to a 
d-d transition. 
The infrared spectra of 2-5 showed the v(C-C) vibration in the region 1935-1948 cm-' as two poorly 
resolved absorption bands in close vicinity. This split- 
ting can result from coupling of triple bonds via the 
alkali metal ion. In 1, no such splitting of ~,(C---C) 
vibration at 2017 cm-~ was observed. The presence of 
coordinated THF in the hexane solutions of 2a and 3a 
was proven by the absorption bands at 1040 and 1053 
cm-' respectively. These wavenumbers are comparable 
with those of 6 (1020 cm -I ) [1 ] and 7 (two bands at 
1057 and 1047 cm -!) [3]. 
3.5. Concluding remarks 
The method of preparation of 2-5 by the redox 
reaction of alkali metals with 1, as well as tLe EPR 
evidence for the presence of Ti(III) in the products, 
leaves no doubt about the presence of alkali metal 
cations in 2-5. The X-ray structure of 4 confirms the 
suggestion that the alkali metal cation is held between 
the anionic acetylide arms by an ionic bond [3]. The 
coordinatively unsaturated K + is weakly bonded to the 
CE(I) cyclopentadienyl ring of the adjacent molecule, 
thus creating a polymer chain structure. A striking and 
somewhat irreproducible difference in the colours of 
3-$ in the hydrocarbon solution and in the solid state is 
apparently relevant to a different association in the solid 
state and the solvation or association in solutions. The 
coordination of THF to 2-5 is generally weak and 
decreases with increasing size of alkali metals. The 
magnitude of the tweezer bite angle and the mode of 
association and/or soivation, depending on the size of 
the alkali metal cations, will be clarified by the structure 
investigation of 2, 2a, 3 and $ which is currently under 
way.
