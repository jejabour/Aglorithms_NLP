Abstract 
The structure and morphology of para-nitroaniline dispersed in various polymers such as polymethyl methacrylate, 
polyvinyl alcohol, polvinyl acetate and polyethylene oxide were investigated by X-ray diffraction and optical polarizing 
microscopy as a function of composition. At low concentrations the material showed little structure but at concentrations 
above 40% high crystallinity was observed. Although in all cases the crystal structure conformed to the monoclinic one with 
a = 12.33 A, h = 6.07 A, c = 8.59 A and l3 = 91.45”, the intensities of different peaks especially the 101 and 012 reflections 
as well as the type of growth habit and morphology were strongly dependent on the polymer used.

1. Introduction 
Polymer dispersed electroactive or photoactive 
materials have drawn considerable attention in recent 
years because of their potential applications in opto- 
electronics especially for large area components and 
devices [l-4]. In such cases the optically active 
material such as liquid crystal compound (LC) or 
nonlinear optically active (NLO) crystals such as 
meta-nitroaniline, azo-benzene derivatives, etc. are 
dispersed in a polymeric matrix and processed into 
different forms suitable for specific applications. The 
polymer matrix essentially helps in processing and 
binding the active materials. In the earlier reports the 
* Corresponding author. authors have been mainly concerned with the electri- 
cal and optical properties of such polymer dispersed 
systems in which the polymer was in fact considered 
to be mostly inert [4-61. However, polymers can 
interact with optically active materials through polar 
or hydrogen bonding groups. On the other hand, 
modification of the structure and morphology using 
polymeric media is becoming an increasingly impor- 
tant area for developing new materials such as 
molecular composites, nano-materials etc. [7-IO]. 
During our investigation on the para-nitroaniline 
(PNA) dispersed polymeric composite, an important 
NLO material, we observed peculiar structural fea- 
tures being developed which were dependent on the 
polymer matrix used for dispersion. These novel 
features are described briefly in the present commu- 
nication.

2. Experimental 
The polymer dispersed PNA composite films were 
made by first dissolving the components in a suitable 
solvent and casting the solution on flat glass sub- 
strates held at 30°C preferably under dry conditions 
(RH less than 40%). The different polymers used as 
dispersing matrix or growth media were poly- 
ethylene oxide (PEO, polyox WSR N350, BDH, 
UK), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, MW 75000, Loba 
Chemie, India), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc, Polyvac 
MW 60000, Polychem, India) and polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA, Gujpo1932 HR, GSFC, India). 
The para-nitroniline (PNA, BDH, UK) was dissolved 
in either acetone, methanol or deionized water corre- 
sponding to the polymer used (PMMA, PVAc, PVA 
or PEO respectively) and then added to the polymer 
solution. The films were dried for 24 h and stored 
under dry conditions. The structure and morphology 
were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical 
polarizing microscopy in the same manner as re- 
ported elsewhere 19, I 1,121. 
3. Results and discussion 
The PNA dispersed polymer films were transpar- 
ent yellow in appearance for low concentrations of 
PNA (40%) while these turned increasingly opaque 
with the increase of PNA content above 40% thus 
suggesting that the latter samples were highly crys- 
talline. The XRD scans for PNA-PMMA composite 
films containing different concentrations of PNA are 
shown in Fig. 1 in which the curves A to E corre- 
spond to PNA concentrations of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 
80% respectively. It is evident from these scans that 
there are a large number of sharp reflections which 
appear in the 20 region of 10” to 26” for high 
concentrations of PNA but these decrease consider- 
ably both in number and intensity with the decrease 
of PNA concentration (or increase of PMMA con- 
tent). It is interesting to note that in all cases, even 
for low concentrations of PNA, there is a very sharp 
intense peak at 28 of 23.2” which is in fact of low 
intensity in pure PNA [ 131. The detailed analysis of 
these data (table not indicated here) suggests that the 
various peaks can be assigned to various reflections 
from the same monoclinic structure of PNA which Fig. 1. Wide angle X-ray diffraction scans for PNA-PMMA 
molecular composite films containing different concentrations of 
PNA. Curves A to E correspond to PNA concentrations of 10, 20, 
40, 60 and 80% respectively. 
has been reported in the liierature, viz: with the 
l!ttice parameters a = 12.33 A, b = 6.07 A, c = 8.59 
A and B = 91.45” respectively [14]. The large 
changes in the relative intensity of the peaks with the 
increase of PMMA content seem to suggest that 
although the crystalline form remains the same the 
morphology and growth pattern are strongly influ- 
enced by the presence of PMMA. By itself PMMA is 
known to be amorphous but it can interact through 
the C = 0 groups with the NH, group of PNA 
molecules. Assuming such is the case then one would 
expect the PNA molecules to have constrained mo- 
bility during crystallization and their alignment would 
be restricted along certain directions. This can lead 
to preferential growth of some crystalline faces and 
changes in the morphological features. 
In order to bring out the effect of the molecular

interaction between the polymer and PNA on its 
growth morphology, different other polymers were 
used as the growth/dispersing media and similar 
studies carried out. All the data are not presented 
here but the salient features which emerge from the 
same are described. Fig. 2 gives the comparison of 
the XRD scans for samples containing the same 
concentrations of PNA (80%) but with different 
polymer matrices. Curves (a), (b), (c) and (d) corre- 
spond to PMMA, PVAc PVA and PEO as the matrix 
respectively. There are clearly large differences in 
the intensities of various peaks with the change of 
the polymer matrix. The detailed analysis of these 
data is indicated in Table 1 which also gives the 
corresponding values for pure PNA. It is evident 
from these data that PNA crystallizes in the same 
monoclinic structure in all the polymeric media used 
but with different crystalline faces becoming more 
prominent in some polymers than in others. For example, the 012 peak of PNA has highest intensity 
in PMMA and PVAc while the 202 peak becomes 
strongest in the presence of PVA or PEO. It may be 
mentioned here that except for PEO, all other poly- 
mers used are mainly amorphous [15] and hence the 
crystallizing component is only PNA. It is interesting 
to note that the polymer-PNA interaction in the case 
of PMMA and PVAc is expected through C = 0 and 
NH, groups while that for PVA is through OH with 
NO, group of PNA. On the other hand, PEO is 
known to form complexes with NH, containing 
compounds such as urea and one may expect a 
similar type of interactions in PEO-PNA. 
Fig. 3 shows the optical polarizing micrographs 
for the PNA-polymer composite films having 80% 
PNA but different polymer matrices: (a) PMMA, (b) 
PEO, (c> PVA and (d) PVAc respectively. The dis- 
tinctly different morphological features obtained in 
each case are clearly revealed in these micrographs.

These observations clearly demonstrate the important 
role of the polymer matrix together with its specific 
interaction in controlling the growth and morphology 
of the crystallizing component dispersed in it. The 
changes in the relative intensities in the XRD scans 
can be understood in terms of the placement of the 
crystallites with respect to the sample surface. It may 
be noted that these samples were in the form of films 
and XRD scans recorded in the reflection mode 
(wide angle X-ray powder diffractometer). Changes 
in the intensities of certain reflections will be ex- 
pected when the crystallites have preferred growth 
direction/orientation with respect to the film surface 
[ 16,171. The placement of the crystallite faces will be 
more randomly oriented in the case of sperulites than 
in the case of long needle-shaped crystallites. In the 
latter case the long axis would preferentially lie 
along the film surface. In the case of platelet mor- 
phology, the flat crystallite faces would tend to be 
along the film surface. It appears from the XRD

crystal is preferably along the film surface in 
PMMA-PNA and PVAc-PNA systems giving rise 
to a large increase of the 012 reflection while the 
{UC} plane of the crystals is along the film surface for 
the PVA-PNA composite. 
There are a number of reports available in the 
literature on guest/host systems using polymeric 
media. Kryszewski et al. have extensively studied 
the dispersion of charge transfer complex salts 
(TTF-TCNQ, TTT-TCNQ etc.) in different poly- 
mers such as polyvinylidene fluoride, polypropylene, 
etc. [18-201. In a few cases they have reported the 
morphology for such systems and this comprised of 
tiny filamentary type crystals dispersed in the poly- 
meric matrix. They have also observed spherulitic 
morphology when these charge transfer salts were 
dispersed in polyvinylidene fluoride and long 
needle-shaped oriented crystallites when grown in 
polypropylene. However, they have neither discussed 
these features any further nor reported their X-ray 
diffraction scans; their main concern being the elec- 
trical properties of such systems. Many NLO chro- 
mophores based on azobenzene derivatives, nitroani- 
lines etc. have also been studied in the form of 
guest/host systems using polymers such as PMMA, 
polycarbonate, polyethylene etc. [4,5,21,22]. Some 
authors report that such chromophores are molecu- 
larly dispersed in the polymers but there are other 
groups who have found that the additives can crystal- 
lize in oriented structures especially after poling 
and/or when passed through differential temperature 
zones [23,24]. However, the X-ray diffraction data 
have not been reported in the earlier studies for such 
NLO crystals dispersed in polymers and it is difficult 
to surmise whether there were large differences found 
from the original. A few authors have observed that 
the samples are transparent at low concentrations of 
the guest molecules and suggest that they are amor- 
phous. However, in the present case it was found 
that although the samples are transparent at low 
concentrations of PNA (about 20%) these exhibit 
one or two distinct diffraction peaks. 
The exact mechanism by which the morphology 
of the crystals of the additives when grown in differ- 
ent polymers changes is not yet fully understood. In 
the first instance, it may appear that the changes 
observed in the present studies could be due to the 
different solvents used. Recently Liu et al. [25] have dispersing PNA and in this case too a single strong 
reported the effect of solvents on the growth mor- 012 peak of PNA was observed to emerge promi- 
phology of crystals. However, it can be seen that in nently at a concentration of 20% of PNA (see Fig. 
the case of PEO and PVAc, the solvent used was the 4). This certainly points to the interaction between 
same (viz. methanol) but the X-ray diffraction shows C = 0 and NH, groups as the source for the modifi- 
large changes in the intensities of some peaks in the cation of growth pattern and/or the changes in the 
two cases. Similarly, in the case of PMMA the X-ray diffraction scans for these samples. Tenta- 
solvent used was acetone while that for PVA was tively, one may consider that in the initial stages of 
acetone/water mixture but in these cases also no the film formation, PNA molecules are attracted
