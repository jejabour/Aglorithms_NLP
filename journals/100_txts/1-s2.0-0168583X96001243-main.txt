Abstract 
We have’studied, by “in situ” Raman spectroscopy, the modifications induced by 3 keV He+ ions on thin amorphous 
carbon grain deposits. Previous results obtained with our experimental apparatus show that in the case of carbon-containing 
frozen targets (such as benzene and butane) for doses greater than about 100 eV/mol, ion irradiation induces the formation 
of an hydrogenated amorphous carbon. In this paper, the bombarded material is already an amorphous carbon with a 
relatively high order degree. In this case ion irradiation progressively decreases the order degree in the amorphous carbon. 
This result is in agreement with analogous ion irradiation experiments carried out on highly ordered pyrolitic graphite 
crystals. These studies are important to understand physical characteristics and evolution of refractory carbon grains in 
astrophysical environments. 
1. Introduction 
The interaction between a fast colliding ion and solid 
targets produces several effects, many of which have been 
studied in recent years in view of their astrophysical 
applications [l-6]. 
Raman spectroscopy can provide valuable information 
on the effects induced by ions impinging on solids. Indeed 
this technique is used to distinguish among chemical 
species and can provide valuable evidence of the structural 
properties of materials and, in particular, of carbonaceous 
materials. Raman spectroscopy has been used to gain 
insight into the structural lattice damage of graphite result- 
ing from ion bombardment [7-91. 
Among the studied effects the formation of an organic 
residue evolving at higher doses towards an ion-produced 
HAC (Hydrogenated Amorphous Carbon) is particularly 
interesting. The HAC formation has been observed in 
several kinds of carbon-containing targets (polystyrene, 
polypropylene, graphite, diamond etc.) and even on frozen 
gases (C,H,, CH,, C,Hlo etc.). This occurs for a combi- 
nation of bombarding ions (H, He, Ar, Kr etc.) and ion 
energies (ranging between a few keV and MeV). Both fast 
ions (low energy cosmic rays, galactic protons, solar pro-

targets, i.e. frozen (interstellar grains in dense regions, 
comet mantles etc.) and refractory species (interstellar 
grains in the diffuse medium, interplanetary dust particles 
etc.), are supposed to be present in space. Thus materials 
produced in the laboratory may simulate to some extent 
those present in space. 
IDPs (Interplanetary Dust Particles) collected in the 
Earth atmosphere have sizes from 1 to 50 pm and provide 
a unique opportunity to study extraterrestrial material in 
the laboratory. In many IDPs, poorly graphitized carbona- 
ceous compounds are arranged in a granular (fluffy) struc- 
ture where single grains can be as small as 100 A [lo]; in 
some cases amorphous carbonaceous material surrounds 
tub micron mineral grains with a covering layer up to 300 
A of thickness [ 1 I]. A Rarnan study of a representative set 
of 20 IDPs [ 121 has shown that 6 different groups of 
spectra can be identified. AlI particles, except those be- 
longing to the last group, show the Raman feature charac- 
teristic of amorphous carbon with different degree of 
order. Since IDPs are exposed to the fast solar proton (100 
keV) and solar wind particles (1 keV/amu) bombardment 
before collection in the Earth atmosphere, it is interesting 
to compare the Raman spectra of IDPs with those of 
ion-irradiated fluffy aggregate of sub micron amorphous 
carbon grains.

amorphous carbon grains irradiated with 3 lceV He+ ions. 
Some astrophysical implications are also discussed. 
2. Characterisation of the AC samples 
The amorphous carbon (AC) studied in this work has 
been produced by arc discharge between two amorphous 
carbon electrodes in an inert Ar atmosphere. The dust 
deposit has been collected onto a LiF substrate. The AC 
samples have been fully characterised in [ 131. TEM studies 
carried out on AC samples ([13] and references therein) 
showed that they are ctnstituted of spheroidal grains with 
average radii of 50 A arranged in a fluffy structure. 
Infrared spectroscopy of the AC samples shows the 
aliphatic (sp’) C-H stretching structure in the 3.4 pm 
region. Both -CH, and -CH,- symmetric and asymmet- 
ric stretches are present. From Fig. 5 in Ref. [13] and by 
using average areal peak cross-sections for the -CH, and 
-CH,- groups [ 141 it is possible to estimate the fraction of 
hydrogen atoms bound to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. 
The resulting ratio with respect to the total amount of 
carbon atoms contained in the AC sample is H/C = 4%, 
and the ratio between the number of -CH, and -CH,- 
groups is: N(-CH,)/N(-CH,-) = 2.3. No C-H aromatic 
stretching is present (within the noise) in the 3.3 pm 
region, this points out that most of the hydrogen atoms are 
bound to sp3 carbon atoms although some H atoms must 
be bound also to sp’ aromatic C atoms since in the 1 l-14 
pm region the C-H aromatic out of plane bending with 1, 
2 and 3 adjacent H are observed. From Fig. 5 in Ref. [ 131 
it is also evident the presence of a weak C-O stretching 
feature due to oxygen contamination, the corresponding 
estimated O/C atomic ratio is less than = 0.5%. 
3. Experimental apparatus 
Optical microscopy performed on the AC samples 
showed that they are not uniform in the micron scale. 
Since the Raman laser spot size is about 20 pm, we used 
an apparatus to obtain “in situ” Raman spectra, to be sure 
to analyse always the same portion of the sample during 
ion bombardment. 
The experimental apparatus used to perform “in situ” 
Raman spectroscopy has been described in detail else- 
where [15]. It consists of a vacuum chamber (P = 10e7 
mbar) where the targets are mounted on a cold finger 
(lo-300 K) and irradiated with 3 keV ions. The 514 nm 
argon laser beam is focalized through a glass window on 
the sample and the scattered light is collected by a colli- 
mating lens on the entrance slit of the monochromator. We 
used a 90” scattering geometry where the directions of the 
laser beam, ion beam and the collected Raman scattered 
light are mutualIy perpendicular. The sample holder is 
inclined by 30” with respect to the incident laser light (vertical axis) and is azimutally rota&l by 45” with respect 
to the ion beam direction. Hence before, during and after 
irradiation, spectm can be obtained without tilting the 
sample. 
The Raman spectrometer is a SPEX 1877 triple 
monochromator. The used detector is an OMA III (EG & 
G Princeton Applied Research) intensified reticon. 
4. Experimental results 
The sample has been irradiated with 3 keV helium ions 
at different doses. Raman spectra obtained “in situ” at 
different doses are shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the 
shape of the Raman spectrum varies with the dose. In 
order to analyse the variation quantitatively we adopted a 
line shape fitting procedure. For both the G and D lines 
(see the next section) we used a line profile given by the 
relation [ 161: 
(1) 
where dI/do is proportional to the detector signal at o, 
o0 is the undamped mode frequency, w is the frequency 
shift from the laser line (Raman shift), r is a damping 
constant and C is a constant of proportionality. Non-linear 
least square routines have been used to fit the experimental

Raman shifts [cm-‘]

parameters (C, w. and r for each of the lines). The 
resulting theoretical curves are reported together with the 
experimental spectra in Fig. 1. The estimated values for 
the peak frequency of the G line, the PWHM of both G 
and D lines and the ratios between their peak intensities 
are reported versus the dose in Fig. 2. Here the error bars 
correspond to an increase of x2 by 1 (one standard 
deviation errors). Our analysis evidences: (1) the increas- 
ing of both D and G line widths, (2) the downward shift of 
the G line peak frequency, (3) the decrease (except for the 
lowest irradiation dose) of the In/Z, intensity ratio with 
the dose. As it will be explained in the next section, these 
results are consistent with an increasing disorder induced 
by ion-irradiation. 
5. Discussion 
Carbonaceous materials can widely vary in chemical 
composition and structure (diamond, graphite, glassy car- 
bon, hydrogenated amorphous carbon etc.>. Depending on 
the order degree of graphitic (sp* hybridization) materials, 
one or two fiit order Raman bands are observed. Accord- ing to the momentum conservation selection rule, only one 
first order Raman band at about 1582 cm-’ is observed in 
HOPG (Highly Ordered Pyrolitic Graphite) or natural 
graphite with large (> 1 ,um) micro crystals [17]. This 
band is known as the G (graphitic) line and is due to a 
doubly degenerate deformation vibration of the hexagonal 
ring corresponding to the E,, mode of graphite with D64, 
crystal symmetry [18]. However, spectra of microcrys- 
talline graphite and disordered carbons show an additional 
1360 cm-’ line. This D (disordered) line is attributed to 
phonons near the Brillouin zone boundary active in small 
crystallites or on the boundaries of larger crystallites. It 
was found [18] that the intensity ratio (fn/io) of the D 
and G lines varies as the inverse of the crystal planar 
domain size L, (In/& a l/L,). In amorphous carbons 
and hydrogenated amorphous carbons, both G and D bands 
are present. These bands are quite broader than those 
observed in disordered graphite: the broader the bands, the 
more disordered the amorphous carbon is. In amorphous 
carbon obtained by sputtering deposition the two bands 
cannot be distinguished, the G line is usually shifted at 
lower Raman shifts ( 1560 cm-,’ ) and the D line becomes a 
shoulder of the G line. 
In particular the line width of both G and D bands is 
related to the bond angle disorder, and to the relative 
amount of crystallites versus the amorphous matrix. The 
observed line width increase points out that the amorphous 
carbon sample becomes more and more disordered during 
ion irradiation. 
Computer simulations [19] of the Raman spectra of 
amorphous carbons, modelled by mixtures of threefold- 
and fourfold-coordinated atoms, show that both coordina- 
tion and bond angle disorder produce a G line shift at 
lower frequencies. Following Ref. [19], the G line is 
shifted to 1528 cm- ’ when the bond angle is changed 
from the ideal 120” to a disordered average of 117.7”. This 
seems to be the only mechanism capable of producing this 
effect. The G line shift observed in our experiment from 
1592 cm-’ down to 1554 cm-’ (see Fig. 2) is in agree- 
ment with an enhanced bond-angle disorder induced by 
ion-irradiation, and may indicate that the fourfold-coordi- 
nated atoms increase in number with respect to the three- 
fold-coordinated atoms. 
Annealing experiments carried out on poor ordered 
amorphous carbon films [20,21] show that the I,/& ratio 
vs. the annealing temperature initially increases, then de- 
velops a maximum at some temperature. between 800 and 
9O@C, and finally decreases down to zero at high anneal- 
ing temperature when graphitization has occurred [21]. The 
initial increase of the I,,/& has been interpreted as evi- 
dencing that the crystallites grow in size and/or in num- 
ber. When effects of momentum conservation becomes 
important (momentum is conserved in large crystals), the 
In/Io ratio starts decreasing. In the hypothesis that anneal- 
ing induces a monotone increase in the sp* average cluster 
size, the initial increasing trend of the &,/lo ratio is in 
198 GA. Baratta et aL/Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B 116 (1996) 195-199 
agreement with other experiments carried out on amor- 
phous carbon films with different order degree. In fact, 
Yoshikawa et al. [22] found that the In/& ratio is related 
to the size distribution of the sp’ cluster in poor ordered 
amorphous carbon films, as in this case larger clusters 
contribute preferentially to the D line. On the other hand, 
the relation found by [ 181, Zn/Zo a l/L,, should be valid 
in the decreasing part of the curve, when crystal-size 
effects cause the decrease in the intensity ratio. 
If the initial increase of the Zn/Zo ratio observed in our 
irradiated samples is real, in analogy with Ref. [20] we can 
apply the relation In/Z, a l/L, to the first point in Fig. 2 
(lowest panel). This provides (through a comparison with 
Fig. 3 of Ref. [la]) a micro crystal size of L, = 40 A,. If 
the crystal size found by Raman spectroscopy is correct, 
this should imply that the spheroidal grains are rather 
ordered within their physical size of 50 A (in average) 
given by TEM analysis. 
“In situ” Raman spectroscopy of frozen films (T = 10 
K) of benzene and butane irradiated with 3 keV of He+ 
ions [6], showed that the irradiated targets were converted 
into a a-H:C with a relatively low degree of order. Further 
irradiation of those a-H:C at room temperature showed an 
opposite behaviour with respect to that found for the AC 
sample. In particular the In/Z, ratio was found to increase 
with the dose up to a saturation value; while the optical 
gap together with the H/C ratio, measured by ERDA, 
decreased. These results were interpreted in terms of an 
increasing average sp* cluster size attributed to the prefer- 
ential hydrogen loss from sp2 sites with respect to sp3 sites 
as evidenced by infrared spectroscopy [6]. Analogous re- 
sults have been obtained bombarding a polystyrene film 
with 240 keV of Ar+ ions at room temperature [23]. 
The results obtained for the AC and a-H:C samples are 
similar to those found by Compagnini et al. [24] on two set 
of samples: a high temperature annealed (900°C) amor- 
phous carbon called HGC (Hydrogenated Graphitic Car- 
bon) and a conventionally ion produced a-H:C carbon. The 
HGC possesses an optical energy gap below 0.1 eV, an 
sp2/sp3 carbon fraction of about 80% (by EELS) and a H 
content of about 15 at.%. The a-H:C is a highly hydro- 
genated sample (40 at.%) with an energy gap of 1.5 eV 
and a sp2/sp3 carbon fraction of about 30%. Ion beam 
irradiation with 300 keV Ar+ showed that while in a-H:C 
the optical energy gap decreases reaching about 0.5 eV, 
the H content decreases to about 18% and the sp2/sp3 
carbon fraction increase up to 65%. In HGC the process is 
reversed, in particular the sp2/sp3 carbon fraction de- 
creases down to a saturation value of about 70%. The final 
result was an amorphous structure with the same physical 
properties independently of the starting sample. This simi- 
larity is also observed in our case, in fact the Raman 
spectrum of the a-IX from frozen benzene irradiated at 
the highest dose (1000 eV/C-atom) [6] is very similar to 
the Raman spectrum of the AC sample at 660 eV/C-atom 
(the most disordered). During ion-beam irradiation, two competitive processes 
must be considered: graphitization and amorphization. The 
first one can be related to the energy release in form of 
heat (“thermal spikes”) inside the collision cascade (sp3 
to sp2 conversion with or without H loss), while the latter 
is caused by the displacement collisions and depends on 
the size of the crystallites. It should be also considered that 
the characteristic time for relaxation of the excitation 
generated by an ion is of the order of one picosecond or 
less; thus equilibrium processes (like annealing) are not 
possible (see Ref. [25] for a comparison between laser 
irradiation, ion and electron bombardment and thermal 
annealing on a-H:C). According to Ref. [24] the saturation 
effect is due to the competition between these two pro- 
cesses, being the saturation reached when they are equal. 
In analogy with Ref. [24], this should imply that ion 
irradiation of the AC sample produces a strong decluster- 
ing of the atomic configuration of the sp2 carbon compo- 
nent: the amorphization process (also observed in ion 
irradiated HOPG [9]) prevails on graphitization. This prob- 
ably because the initial sp2 on sp3 carbon ratio is relatively 
high in the AC sample as testified both by the low H 
content and by the initial G line peak position. Ion irradia- 
tion of conventional a-HC, in contrast, produces a cluster- 
ing of the sp2 carbon fraction suggesting that graphitiza- 
tion, accompanied by the H loss, is the driving process for 
the structural transformation. Indeed in this case the initial 
sp2 on sp3 carbon ratio is low [6] and the structure is 
highly disordered (as testified by the corresponding Raman 
spectra), so that graphitization prevails on amorphization. 
6. Astrophysical applications 
In the Raman study by Wopenka [ 121 (see Introduction) 
the 20 IDPs have been classified in 6 different groups 
where the order degree decreases from group 1 to group 6, 
as testified by the increasing band width and by the 
decreasing Z&Z, ratio. The Raman spectrum of the two 
most ordered groups is very similar to those of AC grains 
before irradiation. This result indicates that AC grains are 
good analogues of the carbonaceous phase of the IDPs 
belonging to the most ordered groups 1 and 2 (at least 
from a structural point of view). 
It was shown that IDPs are exposed to the penetrating 
(E = 100 keV) solar proton flux up to a total dose of the 
order of 10 to 100 eV/mol, during the 104-lo5 yr spent 
in the interplanetary medium before collection on Earth 
[3]. The flux of solar wind particles provides a much 
greater dose (i04-lo5 eV/mol), but only to a depth of 
= 0.02 j.4,m. In this scenario we are investigating the 
possibility that the different order degree exhibited by 
IDPs, could be explained (see Fig. 2) by a different 
ion-irradiation dose corresponding to the time spent in the 
interplanetary medium before collection in Earth atmo- 
sphere.
