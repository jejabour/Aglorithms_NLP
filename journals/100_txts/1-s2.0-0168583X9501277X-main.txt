Abstract 
Vacancy accumulation in pure FZ-Si crystals covered with thin Si,N, films leads upon irradiation with a high intensity 
electron beam in a high voltage electron microscope (HVEM) at temperatures between 20 and 250°C, to the suppression of 
the formation of (113)-defects of interstitial type in the central part of the irradiated area. Very small secondary clusters of 
interstitial type with a density of about IO” cmm2 appear, however, in this area after prolonged irradiation. Small stacking 
fault tetrahedra and Frank loops of vacancy type connected with interstitial clusters were analysed on an atomic scale in the 
thinnest part of the irradiated area in a 400 keV high resolution electron microscope. Vacancy clusters might act as 
nucleation centres for the observed secondary defect formation. 
1. Introduction 
High fluxes of 1 MeV electrons in a high voltage 
electron microscope (HvEM) create a supersaturation of 
self-interstitials in Si crystals covered by thin films of SiO, 
or Si3N, [ 11. These self-interstitials cluster in the so-called 
{113}-defects. It was found that the state of impurity atoms 
such as oxygen, carbon and dopant atoms (P,B) plays an 
important role during the formation of the {I 13}-defects in 
Si crystals [ 1.21. The formation of irradiation-induced 
{I 13)-defects is different between pure floating zone (FZ) 
and Czochralski (Cz) Si [l-4] because the former has a 
low concentration of impurity atoms. It was concluded that 
only defects related to the impinging impurity atoms from 
the irradiated surface are observed at temperatures from 
room temperature to 400°C in FZ-Si [2]. To exclude the 
effect of impurity atoms, introduced in the electron micro- 
scope to the surface of the specimen, on the defect forma- 
tion, the present study was carried out on FZ-Si specimens 
covered with a thin Si,N, coating to prevent indiffusion of 
impurities after TEM specimen preparation. 
2. Experiments 
The specimens were prepared from a FZ-Si crystal in 
(110) orientation containing 1 X lOI cme3 interstitial

and 3 X lOI cms3 substitutional phosphorous atoms. The 
thinned Si specimens were covered with Si,N, films of 
5-15 nm thickness. In situ observation using the high-volt- 
age electron microscope JEOL-1250 at Antwerp Univer- 
sity (RUCA) was carried out in a (Ill} dynamical contrast 
mode in the temperature range of 20-450°C at 1 MeV. 
The intensities of irradiation were between 3 X IO’* and 
3 X lOI electrons/cm2 s. The temperature control during 
in situ experiments was performed by thermocouple mea- 
surement on the specimen cup. Some of the specimens 
were irradiated and investigated by the JEM-4000-EX high 
resolution electron microscope operated at 400 keV at the 
Institute of Semiconductor Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia). 
3. Results 
The defect creation in FZ-Si crystals covered with 
Si,N, films during electron irradiation in the temperature 
range 20-250°C depends on the electron beam intensity in 
the central part of the irradiated area. The density of the 
defects in this area decreases from about 10” cme2 up to 
complete suppression by increasing the intensity of irradia- 
tion from 3 X IO’* to 3 X lOI electrons/cm2 s, as shown 
in Fig. 1. The incubation time for nucleation of these 
initially formed defects is slightly increased by increasing 
the beam intensity for irradiation temperatures up to 300°C 
as shown in Fig. 2a. After about 10 min of irradiation with 
maximum beam intensity secondary (very small) clusters

of point defects also appear in the central part of the 
irradiated area (Fig. 3). The density of these secondary 
defects increases upon prolonged irradiation (45-120 min) 
at a dose of about 10” cm-*. The incubation time for the 
creation of these defects was found to be strongly depen- 
dent on the electron beam intensity as also shown in Fig. 
2a. Both the initial and the secondary defects are of the 
interstitial type and thus reveal a supersaturation of self-in- 
terstitials. This two-step nucleation mechanism has also 
been reported elsewhere but without real understanding of 
why the secondary defects nucleate (e.g. Refs. [1,2]). 
Irradiation at temperatures above 300°C leads to the forma- 
tion of the (113}-defects which do not disappe.. even at 
higher intensity of irradiation. The incubation time for the 
nucleation of these defects is also decreased by increasing 
the irradiation intensity in the available range (see Fig. 2a). 
The creation rate of the initially formed defects at T= 
210-250 (curve 2) and at T- 310-350°C (curve 1) as a 
function of the electron beam intensity is shown in Fig. 2b. 
Curve (2) illustrates the decrease of initial defects with 
increasing electron beam intensity, while curve (1) illus- 
trates that the initial defects formed at higher temperature 
are stable. The two dark field micrographs in Fig. 4 show the 
changes in size and defect density for changing thickness 
of the wedge-shaped TEM specimens irradiated at T= 
250°C in the central part. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that in 
the thinnest part of the irradiated area (first extinction 
band), only very small defects with black-white contrast 
are observed. The mixing of these and the {113)-defects is 
observed in the thicker part of the third extinction contour 
(Fig. 4b). The small size of the defects (up to about 2 nm) 
makes it difficult to determine the type of the created 
defects. Therefore the same type of specimens were irradi- 
ated and investigated on an atomic scale in a 400 keV high 
resolution electron microscope. Fig. 5 shows various types 
of defects found in the thinnest part of FZ-Si crystals 
during irradiation in a high resolution electron microscope. 
From Fig. 5c we can conclude that the image of one plane 
of the V-shaped defect differs from the image of the other 
plane. It can be clearly seen that the first one is of the 
vacancy prismatic type and the second one is a non-pris- 
matic defect. An atomic model of the V-shaped defect 
based on the HREM-image is shown in Fig. 5d. The model 
illustrates that the V-shaped defect corresponds to a Frank 
loop of the vacancy type connected with a Shockley

dislocation gliding from the core of Frank dislocation. The 
defect appears to be the classical stacking fault tetrahedron 
of vacancy type which has one plane of prismatic vacancy 
defects perpendicular to the (110) surface of the specimen. 
Fig. 5b reveals an undissociated vacancy Frank loop which 
may be interconnected to an interstitial cluster close to the 
core of the dislocation. Another type of defect on the (11 l} 
plane, after prolonged irradiation (about 30 min), was 
found in the thicker irradiated areas (see Fig. 6a). The 
HREM-images of these defects distinguish them from the 
vacancy defects in the thinnest irradiated area. Very small 
distortions of the (111) planes parallel to the defect plane 
are observed, enabling the determination of the type of 
defects from the HREM-images. These images reveal regu- 
lar sequences of complicated configurations of black and 
white dots. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that these defects 
can also be connected with { 113) defects. the irradiated area. Irradiation conditions are 250°C. 
4. Discussion 
The results reported here reveal a vacancy accumula- 
tion in FZ-Si crystals covered by Si,N, films during 
irradiation with a high intensity electron beam at tempera- 
tures ranging from 20 to 250°C. This leads to the suppres- 
sion of the creation of interstitial clusters. Upon continued 
irradiation, vacancy clusters are formed in the shape of 
stacking fault tetrahedra and separated undissociated Frank 
loops. The decrease of the creation rate of interstitial 
clusters with increasing intensity of irradiation gives some 
evidence to conclude that free vacancies accumulate at 
high intensity in pure FZ-Si and may dissolve the nuclei of 
interstitial clusters before their appearance. 
After prolonged irradiation the accumulation of free 
vacancies leads to the formation of vacancy clusters in the 
thinnest part of the irradiated crystal in the form of stack-

ing fault tetrahedra (SIT). It seems that the strain at the 
interface Si-Si,N, may play an important role in the 
relaxation of the deformed crystal area around the Frank 
dislocation core. We assume that the strain promotes the 
formation of a gliding Shockley dislocation. Indeed the 
stacking fault energy in Si is high enough for the mecha- 
nism of the formation of Sfl, well-known for metals (51, 
to be realised. There are few reports about SFT in Si, all of 
which concern the formation of Sfl in the top silicon 
layer between the surface and the amorphous buried layer A much more complicated behaviour of vacancy clus- 
ters occurs in the thicker irradiated areas where the con- 
centration of interstitials becomes higher and the process 
of point defect recombination must be strong. As recently 
found, the interstitial atoms may be located in (11 l} atomic 
plane in a metastable intermediate configuration if they 
interact with the core of interstitial Frank dislocation [9]. 
On the basis of the HREM-images, an atomic model of a 
transformed dislocation core has been developed including 
a regular sequence of double five-membered rings and 
single eight-membered atomic rings. as illustrated in Fig.

6b-6e. From the comparison of the HREM-images of the 
defects in the (111) plane shown in Fig. 6a with the 
transformed core of the Frank dislocation in Fig. 6b, we 
may assume that the core of the vacancy Frank dislocation 
can also interact with interstitial atoms. This process will 
lead to the filling up of the plane of the vacancy loops with 
interstitials having a similar configuration as in the core of 
the interstitial Frank dislocation (Fig. 6e). At the same 
time, the interaction of interstitials with stable vacancy 
loops may lead to the compensation of the strain around 
the vacancy loops and to the formation of a new configura- 
tion of interstitial atoms in the (111) planes without full 
recombination of the extended defects. This assumption 
agrees well with the low probability for insertion of inter- stitial atoms to the lattice points in the dislocation loop 
planes due to the energy barrier at low temperatures [lo]. 
For this reason the interstitial atoms do form a metastable 
intermediate configuration on the different planes as ob- 
served. 
5. Conclusion 
In situ high-voltage and high-resolution electron mi- 
croscopy of FZ-Si specimens gives rise to characteristic 
secondary defects of both vacancy and interstitial type 
which are probably related to vacancy clustering during 
prolonged irradiation at temperatures below 250°C. Va- 
cancy accumulation leads to the formation of stacking fault

tetrahedra and separated Frank loops in the thinnest part of 
the irradiated area. In the thicker part of the irradiated area 
the interaction of interstitials with stable vacancy loops 
may lead to the formation of new configurations of inter- 
stitials in the plane of the vacancy loops. The vacancy 
clusters might thus act as nucleation centres for the sec- 
ondary interstitial type defects.
