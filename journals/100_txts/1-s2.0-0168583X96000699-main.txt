Abstract 
In this paper we present the results of an X-my photoelectron spectroscopy study on thin films of amorphous SiO, 
bombarded with neutral or ionic (positive) Ar beams at keV energy. All the bombardments have been performed inside the 
preparation chamber of the XPS spectrometer so that the samples have been compared before and after the irradiation 
without exposing the surface to the air. Moreover, particular care has been taken in measuring the flux of the neutral beam. 
This measurement has been performed utilising the secondary electrons ejected by the surface of the metallic support of the 
sample, so that the comparison between the effects induced by neutral and ionic bombardment is made at the same fluence. 
This in situ comparison allowed us to conclude that for bombardment of SiO, with ions or neutrals, the detected XPS 
modifications are almost identical, within the experimental error, for both kinds of beam. This finding is at variance with 
recent studies claiming different behaviour of the SiO, depending on the charge state of the bombarding beam. Possible 
explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. 
1. Introduction 
Silicon dioxide is one of the most studied materials 
owing to its abundance on the earth surface and to its wide 
use in electronic devices. Despite the existing bulk of 
studies, SiO, is still attracting the interest of many work- 
ers. In particular, for thin SiO, films, the dependence of 
physical and chemical properties on the growth parameters 
and on the post growth processes is currently the objective 
of many studies. Among the most employed post growth 
processes, ion bombardment is one of the most frequently 
adopted. It is well known that ion sputtering, reactive ion 
etching, as well as other energetic processes, produce 
crystalline and stoichiometric damage (chemical reduction) 
[l-l 11. 
The behaviour of thin SiO, films under ion beam 
bombardment is quite interesting. The most part of the 
studies on this subject deal with XPS and Auger studies of 
silica surface irradiated by keV noble gas ions and report 
negligible stoichiometric damage after bombardment, with 
O/Si atomic ratio decreased by a few percent only (see for 
example Ref. [12D. On the contrary other papers report the 
formation of substoichiometric silicon oxides SiO, with x 
as low as 1.34 [13]. At the best of our knowledge no 
plausible explanation for these discrepancies has been

when one compares the effects induced on SiO, by neutral 
or ion bombardment. 
The present study has been prompted by a report on the 
comparison between the effects of ion and neutral bom- 
bardment of SiO, presented at Radiation Effects on Insula- 
tors 7 in Nagoya, Japan (1993) by Mizutani and by some 
papers on the same subject published by the same author 
[14- 161. In these studies different behavior of the SiO, 
has been claimed depending on the charge state of the 
bombarding beam. These findings are in disagreement with 
a recent study on native silicon oxide bombarded with ion 
or neutral Ar particles 133. In this last paper it has been 
shown that Ar neutral or Ar ion beam bombardment of the 
Si/native oxide system gives rise to final amorphous 
surface structures with almost identical XPS spectra. 
In this article we present the results obtained by bom- 
barding thin films of amorphous SiO, with neutral or ionic 
(positive) Ar beams. All the bombardments have been 
performed inside the preparation chamber of an XPS ma- 
chine so that the samples are studied before and after the 
irradiation without exposing the surface to the air. More- 
over, particular care has been taken for the measure of the 
flux of the neutral beam. This measurement has been 
performed by using the secondary electrons ejected by the 
surface of the metallic support of the sample (before and 
after the bombardment of the SiO,), so that the compari- 
son between the effects induced by neutral and ionic 
bombardment is made at the same fluence.

2. Experimental 
The SiO, samples were thin (8000 A) films grown on 
n-type (100) Si substrate wafers. The films were thick 
enough as to be certain that after Ar+ or Are bombard- 
ment the Si/SiO, interface was far away from the surface, 
and in particular at a distance deeper than the sampling 
depth of the XPS technique in silicon oxide (about 60 A>. 
All the bombardments and the XPS measurements were 
performed in the preparation chamber of an XPS spectrom- 
eter KRATOS ES300 (180” hemispherical electrostatic 
analyser) with MgKo excitation (1253.6 eV) at 15 kV x 
12 mA power. The basic pressure in the analysis chamber 
of the spectrometer was 1 X 10v7 Pa. The binding energy 
was calibrated against hydrocarbon C 1s line set at 285.0 
eV. The ion beams were obtained from an AG 21 cold 
cathode source from VG MICROTECH, the neutral beams 
were produced by ION TECH Ltd. FAB 11NF saddle field 
source. The measurement of the ion current I, has been 
performed with the common method, by focusing the beam 
into the small entrance hole of a Faraday cup. If the same 
beam is focused outside the cavity, on the surface of the 
cup metal cover (see Fig. l), one gets a measurement of 
the total current Z,, i.e. ions that impinge on the surface 
and secondary electrons that leave it. By comparing the 
two currents one can obtain the secondary electron yield, 
Y, for that combination of ion, energy and metal: 
,+. 
Fig. 2 shows typical results for Ar+ 45” bombardment. 
As one can see the secondary electron yield does depend 
on bombarding ion, on its energy and on the metal type 
[171. 
During the irradiation of a metal with energetic neutral 
particles, of course, one expects to find emission of sec- 
ondary electrons, too. It is clear that we can exploit the 
emission of these secondary electrons in order to estimate 
the neutral flux. The only assumption we must make is that 
the yield of electron emission for ion bombardment is the 
ion beam

same as the yield for neutral bombardment. This is a 
reasonable assumption as the principles and the mecha- 
nisms of particle induced electron emission do not heavily 
depend on the charge state of the bombarding particle [ 171 
at least at keV energy. In this assumption, a measure of the 
parameter Y and a measure of the secondary electrons 
under neutral bombardment represent a direct, simple 
method for the measure of the neutral flux. 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 3 shows the effects of ion and neutral bombard- 
ment on the two most representative XPS bands of 
SiO,:O 1 S and Si 2p. From the inspection of Fig. 3 one can 
see that the main effects of ion or neutral bombardment on 
the 0 1s and Si 2p bands are almost the same and in 
particular one observes: 1) a broadening of the peaks after 
bombardment and 2) a mild decrease of the O/Si atomic 
ratio. 
3.1. Peak broadening 
After bombardment the Si2p full width at half maxi- 
mum (FWHM) increases from 1.8 to 2.35 eV for ion 
bombardment, and from 1.8 to 2.35 eV for neutral irradia- 
tion. As to the 0 1s band the corresponding figures are 1.6 
eV before bombardment, and 2.15 eV after ion bombard- 
ment and after neutral bombardment (see Table 1). 
A possible reason for this peak broadening might be the 
differential charging up of the silica along the irradiated 
surface. We can rule out this explanation because differen- 
tial charging of the surface should give rise to homoge-

neous broadening for all the photoelectron peaks, while in 
our case we observe different values for the broadening of 
the 0 1 s and Si 2p peaks ( + 0.55 eV for both peaks), and 
other different values for the other peaks of the photoelec- 
tron spectrum not shown in the figure (C 1s for example). 
Another possible explanation might be the differential 
charging along the depth of the sample. It is well known 
that the sampling depth in XPS is a function of the 
photoelectron kinetic energy. In particular the sampling 
depth of the 0 1s peak is expected to be about 70% of the 
corresponding value for the Si 2p peak [ 18,191. Therefore, 
if one makes the hypothesis that there is an in depth 
difSerentiut charging, and that the broadening comes out 
from this in depth charging, the different sampling depth 
of the two bands should give rise to a different broadening. 
In order to check this possibility we performed angle

resolved XPS measurements. By this method one performs 
XPS measurements at different angles with respect to the 
sample normal. When one moves from the sample normal 
to larger and larger angles, the corresponding sampling 
depth decreases in a predictable way [20] because the 
various photoelectron peaks refer to smaller and smaller 
depth. Therefore if the broadening was due to an in depth 
differential charging we should observe some alteration of 
the peak FWHM at different angles. On the contrary, our 
experiments (see Table 2) show that the FWHM values are 
practically insensitive to the angle of measurements. We 
conclude that the peak broadening is not due to an in depth 
differential charging. 
A different explanation for the broadening might be the 
formation of substoichiometric silicon oxide SiO, with 
x = 1 (SiO) or n = 3/2 (Si,O,) in addition to SiO,. In 
this case the broadening should be due to a convolution of 
two or more bands, each referring to a precise silicon 
oxide stoichiometry. We note here that this hypothesis 
must be accompanied by a contemporaneous large de- 
crease of the O/Si atomic ratio, because the observed large 
broadening might be explained only assuming the presence 
of large amount of substoichiometric silicon oxide. We 
shall see in the following that we observe a mild O/Si 
atomic ratio decrease, so that we do not believe that this 
hypothesis can explain the broadening. 
We believe that the only possible explanation of the 
observed broadening is due to the structural disorder 
induced by the ion beam on the silica surface. In this case 
we suggest that the broadening comes out from a distribu- 
tion of Madelung potential values along the surface which 
in turn are due to different values for length and angle of 
the Si-0 bonds along the surface. Of course we cannot 
exclude that the observed mild decrease of the O/Si 
atomic ratio may contribute to the broadening, but we 
believe that the main reason for the XPS peak broadening 
is a structural silica disorder rather than a stoichiometric 
disorder (change of the stoichiometry).

Finally, we note that whichever is the explanation for 
this broadening, it is identical - within the experimental 
error - for both ion and neutral bombardment. 
3.2. Decrease of the O/Si atomic ratio 
It is well known that XPS allows a quantitative analysis 
of the surface constituents @I]. The silica surface has been 
studied by many workers and the main finding is that the 
surface composition is dependent on the sample history. 
For our case, a thermally grown silicon oxide, notwith- 
standing the care in handling the sample, the O/Si atomic 
ratios derived from the XPS are slightly higher than 2 
(average value: 2.05 f. 0.08). The possible reasons for this 
discrepancy have been reported by many workers [22] and 
need not to be repeated here. We note that Table 3, for this 
reason, reports the O/Si atomic ratios normalised to the 
corresponding initial value. The table shows clearly that 
the bombardment with AI++ or Are yields - within the 
experimental error - the same result: i.e. a mild decrease 
of the O/‘Si atomic ratio. 
The reason for the discrepancy between this finding, 
i.e. a mild decrease of the O/Si atomic ratio, and other 
papers claiming more severe decrease for this figure, is not 
clear and needs more work for clarification. We note that 
our finding is in excellent agreement with those reported 
by people who do not make use of electron flooding (for 
example in XPS spectrometers for neutralising the positive 
charging up of the surface) or electron beams (like in 
Auger spectroscopy). Indeed we believe that the use of 
electrons could be responsible for severe chemical reduc- 
tion of the SiO,. In other words we suggest that many 
reports claiming for drastic reduction of SiO, under ion 
beam could be in error due to some artifact induced by the 
use of electrons. In any case, again, we note that whichever 
is the explanation for this discrepancy, our O/Si atomic 
ratio is identical - within the experimental error - for 
both ion and neutral bombardment. 
4. Conclusions 
The results shown here point out that at 5 keV energy, 
ion or neutral bombardment of SiO, yields the same results within the experimental error. This finding is in 
agreement with Ref. [3] but in strong contrast with the 
reports of Mizutani [ 14- 161. Possible explanations for this 
disagreement can be given. The first explanation is simply 
due to the fact that in the work of Mizutani, bombardment 
and analysis have been performed in two different appara- 
tuses, so that during the transfer step the sample has been 
air exposed. Moreover, prior to the analysis (Rutherford 
backscattering or Auger), the samples have been Ar+ 
bombarded in order to sputter away the first layers. This 
complicated (and unsafe) sample handling procedure could 
be responsible for many artifacts. There is, however, an- 
other possible interesting explanation. It is that, while we 
make use of a 5 keV energy, Mizutani bombardment has 
been performed at lower (0.4-0.7 keV) energy. At such a 
low energy there is the possibility that the impinging 
particle does not have enough energy for producing elec- 
tron emission from the sample surface (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 
[17D. At our energy, on the contrary, the energy is high 
enough to have detectable secondary electron emission, 
with the result that the net positive charge in the sample 
bombarded with neutrals is not much different from the 
sample bombarded with ions. This could explain why our 
samples are almost identical after bombardment. At lower 
energy, indeed, the net charge built up during neutral 
bombardment could be negligible, while the ion bom- 
barded sample builds up a positive charge due to the 
neutralisation of the incoming ions. In this case it would be 
easy to understand the reason why neutral bombardment 
seems to induce surface damage substantially lower than 
ion irradiation. This consideration, in our opinion, offers 
stimulating chances for exploring in deeper detail this 
effect with SiO, and other targets [2].
