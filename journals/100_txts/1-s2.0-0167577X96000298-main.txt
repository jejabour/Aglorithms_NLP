Abstract 
Single perovskite phase Pb(Sco,,Ta,,,)O, (PST) thin films have been grown using an one-stage MOCVD method. The 
processing temperature was 600°C. The film structure as a function of Pb/(Sc + Ta) flow ratio was determined using X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy @EM).

1. Introduction 
Lead scandium tantalate, Pb(Sc,,,Ta,,,)O, (PST), 
with perovskite structure is an important ferroelectric 
material with applications in pyroelectric imaging 
because of its high figure of merit [l]. In addition, 
order-disorder behavior on the B-site cation site 
(i.e., SC and Ta) can be manipulated by thermal 
processing conditions, making modifications to the 
dielectric response characterization possible by heat- 
ing-treatment procedures [2]. 
Despite the attractive potential for PST in dielec- 
tric or pyroelectric applications, a major practical 
obstacle has been the high processing temperature 
( = 1560°C) required for densification. In addition, 
temperatures greater than 1200°C are usually re- 
quired to synthesize the perovskite structure, so as to

forms at lower temperatures with poor dielectric 
properties. 
In the past few years, the attempt to synthesize 
PST at reduced temperatures using the sol-gel ap- 
proach has been successful [3-51. The deposition of 
PST thin films with near 100% perovskite phase at 
650°C on platinized silicon has been reported. XRD 
and electron microscopy investigations showed that 
the PST thin films are fully (111) oriented and 
partially B-site ordered after a low-temperature an- 
nealing followed by a slow cooling. On the other 
hand, the low-temperature deposition of PST thin 
films using MOCVD techniques has not been widely 
employed. Bradley [6] mentioned that the deposition 
of PST directly from the metal precursors was not 
successful but the PST perovskite phase was obtain- 
able in a two-stage process: deposition of cubic 
ScTaO, by MOCVD using Ta(OC,H,), and a scan- 
dium-fluorinated B-diletonate Sc(fod),, followed by

diffusion of PbO from a surface layer. Later on, 
Ainger et al. [7] reported the growth of perovskite 
PST thin films on sapphire [ 11021 using MOCVD. 
The processing temperature of 800°C and a subse- 
quent annealing in a Pb-rich ambient were necessary 
to prepare insulating films for electrical characteriza- 
tion. 
In this Letter, we report our preliminary results on 
the study of low-temperature deposition of per- 
ovskite PST films on silicon using the MOCVD 
approach. The processing temperature was 600°C. 
2. Experimental method 
Deposition of perovskite PST thin films was car- 
ried out using a cold wall, low pressure horizontal 
MOCVD apparatus, which can take up to four source 
materials. Precursor materials of Pb(C,, H ,90Z)2 
(bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,S-heptanedionate)lead(II)), 
Sc(C,,H,,O,),( Sc(TMHD),) and Ta(OC,H,), 
(tantalum ethoxide) were chosen as starting materials 
for Pb, SC and Ta, respectively. The mixture of the 
metallorganic precursor vapor was introduced into 
the reactor with high-purity nitrogen carrier gas. The 
flow rate of the carrier gas and the source tempera- 
ture for each of the precursor chambers were con- 
trolled individually to adjust the film composition 
and the growth rate. Pure oxygen was used as the 
oxidant and was introduced into the reactor in a 
separate line. The precursor delivery lines, as well as 
the inlet flange, were heated and maintained at tem- 
peratures higher than the highest source evaporation 
temperature to prevent condensation of the vapor 
phase. Detailed growth conditions are summarized in 
Table 1. 
Polished silicon (100) wafers were used as sub- 
strates. Ta and SC oxide films were grown separately 
before growing the PST films. The growth tempera- 
ture (i.e., the temperature of susceptor) was fixed at 
600°C. Tantalum and scandium source materials were 
heated and kept at 75°C and 140°C during the growth 
procedure, respectively. Tantalate films with 6-Ta>O, 
phase were obtained when the fresh grown films 
were annealed in a flow of 0, at 800°C for 4 h, 
whereas no crystalline peaks could be identified for 
the films grown using only SC source flow at 600°C. Table I

According to the previous report regarding the 
growth of perovskite PST films using MOCVD, a 
two-step growth condition has been found favorable 
at lower processing temperatures, i.e., to grow a 
Sc-Ta compound prier to introducing the Pb compo- 
nent. It is believed that an intermediate ScTaO, 
phase might be formed at the temperature range of 
550-800°C and a direct reaction of ScTaO, with 
PbO will result in the formation of perovskite PST 
phase and circumvent the formation of the low-tem- 
perature stable pyrochlore phase. We therefore started 
to grow I-to-l ScTaO, films before the growth of 
PST by experimentally determining the conditions to 
grow the ScTaO, phase first before introducing Pb 
into the reactor chamber to form the PST perovskite 
phase. The film structure as a function of Pb/(Sc + 
Ta) flow ratio is reported. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. l-to-l Sc-Ta,films 
Fig. 1 illustrates the growth diagram of Sc-Ta 
films at 600°C for a variation of SC and Ta flow rate 
(seem). X-ray diffraction results show three kinds of 
film structures with: (1) more than one phase mix- 
ture (M), (2) Pseudo-cubic ScTaO, phase (PI, (3) 
amorphous phase without crystalline peaks (N). 
Based on growth conditions in Fig. 1, the source 
flow rate for SC and Ta to form 1 -to- I Sc-Ta phase 
using our MOCVD apparatus can be determined as: 
Sc/Ta 1 I.5 and Ta 2 20 seem.

3.2. Perovskite PSTfilms 
After experimentally determining the Sc/Ta ratio 
for the l-to-l ScTaO, phase, the growth of PST 
films was carried out by fixing the Sc/Ta ratio and 
varying the lead flow rate. Fig. 2 shows the XRD 
results of 600°C grown PST films on Si(100) as a

function of the flow rate for Pb/(Sc + Ta). In the 
PST films with Pb/(Sc + Ta) in the range of approx- 
imately 0.6 2 Pb/(Sc + Ta) 2 0.4, a single PST per- 
ovskite phase could be achieved. The films are highly 
(111) oriented with tiny (200) reflection. When the 
Pb/(Sc + Ta) ratio is smaller than this range, films 
show complicated XRD data, characterized with a 
cluster of peaks between 30 and 40”. When the 
Pb/(Sc + Ta) ratio is larger than this range, films 
show a mixture of perovskite PST phase and PbO 
phase for which the peaks are positioned at 28 = 17”, 
29”, 35” and 51”, respectively. 
Fig. 3 gives an SEM microphotograph for a 600°C 
grown PST film in which only the single perovskite 
phase was detected by XRD. Perovskite grains are 
on the average of 100 nm in size and uniformly 
distributed. Some voids among grains exist, indicat- 
ing the PST film is not densitified. A re-crystalliza- 
tion process which is often completed by a subse- 
quent annealing seems necessary to improve the film 
density. Further results will be reported later.

processing temperature was 600°C. Growth condi- 
tions for the formation of the perovskite PST phase 
were experimentally determined. Results indicate the 
feasibility to grow single perovskite phase PST films 
at lower processing temperatures and the possibility 
of using a one-stage growth procedure.
