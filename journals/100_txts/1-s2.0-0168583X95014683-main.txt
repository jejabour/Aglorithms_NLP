Abstract 
The carbon concentrations of chemical vapor deposition grown Si, _ ._,Ge,C y (0.25 < x < 0.37 and 0.01 < ~0.12) layers 
on (100) Si with uniform composition profiles were quantified by two ion analysis techniques. Measurements made with 
backscattering spectrometry using a 4.295 MeV He’+ incident ion were compared to compositions predicted by elastic 
recoil detection (ERD) using a 24 MeV Si 5c incident ion. To enhance the carbon scattering cross section for the 
backscattering measurements, the 4.265 MeV “C(a, a)i2C elastic resonance reaction was used. The carbon concentrations 
of the films were calculated by integrating the resonant scattering cross section using the energy width of the layer as the 
limits of integration. The results of this backscattering analysis technique were compared to the predicted carbon 
concentrations obtained by ERD. It was found that the predictions of these techniques correlated within the uncertainty of 
each method. 
1. Introduction 
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) is a fre- 
quently used method for thin film analysis. However, 
when measuring a light element such as carbon in the 
relatively heavy SiGeC matrix, the sensitivity is too poor 
to detect carbon concentrations in the 1 to 10% range. This 
is due to the background signal from Si and Ge, and due to 
the Z2 dependence of the scattering cross section [ 11. If the 
scattering cross section of carbon can be enhanced, the 
effect of a background signal can be lessened. This can be 
accomplished by the use of the 12C(a, a)“C elastic reso- 
nance reaction which has a local maximum near 4.265 
MeV. At this energy, the cross section is enhanced by a 
factor of about 100 over Rutherford scattering [2-41. The 
data were analyzed by means of a technique which used 
the backscattering yield equation with an integrated reso- 
nance area for the cross section. This will be described in 
detail. A separate technique, elastic recoil detection (ERD), 
was also used to analyze the carbon concentrations of the 
same samples [5]. One of the benefits of ERD analysis is 
the elimination of a heavy element background signal. 
Thus the carbon signal is not obscured. The data from

e-mail: aseah@asuvm.inre.asu.edu these experiments were analyzed with the program SER- 
DAP [6]. The objective of this study was to compare the 
predictions of the carbon concentrations using these two 
methods. 
2. Experimental 
The samples analyzed in this experiment were layers of 
Si,_,_,Ge,C, (0.25 < x < 0.37 and 0.01 < y < 0.12), 
grown on Si(100) substrates. The layer thicknesses ranged 
from 200 to 300 ML The backscattering measurements 
were made using a General Ionex tandem Cockroft-Wal- 
ton accelerator. The vacuum in the backscattering chamber 
was 1 X lo-’ Torr. The detector scattering angle was 
170.0 f 0.3”. The sample was tilted so that the sample 
normal was 7” to the incident beam and the sample stage 
was slowly rotated to reduce the possibility of channeling. 
The detector solid angle, 0, was 1.07 f 0.05 X 10e3 sr. 
Beam energy calibration was made using the i60(a, a)‘60 
elastic resonance reaction in a method based on Scott and 
Paine [7]. Each spectrum was additionally calibrated with 
the aid of an americium marker which emits 5.486 MeV 
alpha particles. The keV/channel conversion and the en- 
ergy offset were determined with the calibration subroutine 
in the simulation program RUMP [8]. This subroutine also 
verifies the incident ion energy. With the combination of

these methods the beam energy and detected energy scales 
were calibrated to within 5 keV. The samples were ana- 
lyzed using a beam energy of 2.0 MeV to determine the 
Si/Ge ratio and the layer thickness in atoms/cm’. These 
values were obtained from the data with RUMP. The 
carbon analysis was performed using an incident energy of 
4.295 + 0.005 MeV and a fluence of 2.5 X lOI He*+. 
This energy places the 4.265 MeV ‘?(a, a)‘*C reaction 
peak near the center of the SiGeC layer. 
The ERD measurements used in this experiment were 
performed using an EN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator 
with a terminal voltage of 4.0 MV. A beam of Si’+ 
incident ions with an energy of 24 MeV was used. The 
sample was positioned so that the sample normal was at an 
angle of 75.0 + 0.2” to the incident beam. The detector 
was positioned so that the recoil scattering angle was at 
30.0 f 0.2”. A 12 urn mylar foil was placed in front of the 
detector to prevent detection of forward scattered heavy 
elements. Calibration was performed using a standard of 
hydrogenated Si3N,. The hydrogen concentration of the 
standard had previously been quantified using nuclear 
reaction analysis. Calibration is necessary to properly align 
the sample and detector geometries, which are sensitive to 
0.2” due to the glancing angles used. It is also necessary to 
calibrate for charge collection and detector efficiency since 
there is no substrate signal for normalization as there is 
with RBS. The data were collected using a multichannel 
analyzer and were converted to spectra of atomic fraction 
versus depth using the program SERDAP. 
3. Data analysis 
3.1. Backscattering 
The carbon area1 density, n(x), was obtained from the 
backscattering yield equation [ 11: 
n(x)= Y(dE/dx) 
Q&(E) ’ (1) 
where d E/d x is the energy loss in the layer, Q is the 
incident ion fluence, and R is the detector solid angle. 
The carbon yield, Y, was obtained from each spectra by 
integrating the area under the carbon peak after subtracting 
the silicon substrate signal with a linear background fit. 
The resonant scattering cross section, u, was deter- 
mined by integrating the resonance data using the incident 
energy as the upper limit of integration and the energy at 
the back edge of the layer as the lower limit of integration. 
To do this the stopping power of the incident ion in the 
layer must be calculated. 
The stopping powers of helium in silicon (E& germa- 
nium (E& and carbon (cc) were taken from TRIM-92 191. A function was fit in the region of interest for each 
element of the form: 
E;= [A In(E) +B]/E, 
and evaluated at the incident beam energy [I]. Bragg’s law 
was then used to calculate the stopping in the layer: 
E=XSiESi +X,,&oc+XCEc, (3) 
where Xi is the atomic fraction of element i. Since the 
concentration of carbon was initially unknown, the equa- 
tions were solved iteratively until the carbon concentration 
converged. The energy of the back edge of the layer was 
determined by multiplying the stopping value by the film 
thickness. These values were then used to integrate the 
resonant scattering cross-sectional area. 
3.2. Elastic recoil detection 
Data from the elastic recoil detection measurements 
were collected in a multichannel analyzer and plotted as 
counts versus channel. The spectra were converted to 
atomic fraction versus depth using the program SERDAP. 
The atomic density of the carbon atoms in the layer was 
calculated using the yield equation [IO]: 
Y,(EcJ = QMxb(Eb> 4)nsE, 
cos 8, dE,/dx ’ (4) 
where Q is the incident ion fluence, N,(x) is the atomic 
density of carbon in the layer at depth x, a(E& 4) is the 
scattering cross section of carbon (which in this experi- 
ment obeys the model of Rutherford), 0 is the detector 
solid angle, SE,, is the energy width of the channels, and 
cos 0, is the cosine of the angle between the incident 
beam and the sample surface normal. The subscript r refers 
to the recoiled atom. The term dE,/dx is the stopping 
power of the incident silicon ion on the inward path and 
the carbon recoil on the outward path and was evaluated 
with a slab analysis. The energy width per channel, 6 Ed. is 
determined from the energy of a surface element peak 
divided by the channel number of that peak. Energy loss in 
the mylar foil was also calculated through slab analysis. 
4. Results 
An ERD spectrum for sample F is shown in Fig. 1. 
This plot shows atomic fraction versus depth. It should be 
noted that the depth resolution of this technique is approxi- 
mately 200 x lOi atoms/cm* and therefore the surface of 
the sample is shown at the half height of the front edge of 
the carbon signal. The slope of this front edge is a result of 
the depth resolution rather than a concentration effect. The 
atomic fraction was averaged from a depth of 200 to 
700 X lOI atoms/cm*. The carbon concentration for all 
of the samples analyzed are listed in Table 1.

Atomic fractions were obtained by averaging all of the data points 
from a depth of 200 to 700X IO” atoms/cm*. The back edge of 
the film was obscured by a hydrogen surface signal and is not 
shown. 
The backscattering data for sample F is shown in Fig. 
2. To the left, at approximately channel 440 is the signal 
from the silicon in the layer. This signal merges with the 
substrate silicon signal about 10 channels lower. The effect 
of silicon resonance reactions can be seen by the large 
fluctuations in the substrate signal yield in channels 250 
through 420. The remainder of the substrate signal is 
smooth which is characteristic of a purely Rutherford cross 
section. The signal from the carbon resonance reaction is 
then sitting on this region of the substrate signal; thus the 
silicon resonance does not interfere with the carbon mea- 
surement.

shown in Fig. 3. The ERD values are plotted along the

gence of the values of these two techniques at the lowest 
carbon concentrations, where the backscattered values are 
always larger than the ERD values. Part of this may be a 
contribution of surface contaminants to the signal. Since it 
is difficult to separate the contributions to the carbon peak 
of surface carbon and carbon in the layer, this type of 
contamination can be misleading. It should be noted that 
this effect can be reduced by using an incident beam 
energy high enough so that the peak of the scattering cross

concentration so that contributions to the carbon signal by accurate carbon signals when the surface is covered by 
surface contaminants can be easily distinguished. hydrocarbons. 
Peak shaped resonance reactions like the i2C(cx, cy)‘*C 
at 4.265 MeV used in this experiment can lead to mislead- 
ing results if not performed carefully due to the extremely 
high dependence on the scattering cross section with en- 
ergy. To minimize this, it is very important that the 
incident ion energy be calibrated to close tolerances. For 
an accuracy of &OS at.%, the beam energy must be 
calibrated to within 5 keV. Acknowledgements 
6. Conclusions 
These experiments showed good agreement between 
two independent techniques for measuring the carbon con- 
centration in SiGeC/Si alloys; elastic recoil detection and 
backscattering spectrometry. The values obtained only di- 
verge slightly at lower carbon concentrations. Since the 
backscattered values are systematically larger than the 
ERD values, it is likely that a portion of this is due to the 
proportional increase in the contribution of surface hydro- 
carbon contamination to the backscattered carbon signal. The authors would like to acknowledge the Arizona

References 
The measurements using ERD are more reliable since 
the scattering cross section obeys the model of Rutherford. 
A profile of the carbon concentration is also obtained; thus 
enabling one to distinguish the contribution of surface 
hydrocarbons. However, this technique requires an acceler- 
ator capable of producing 2 24 MeV silicon ion beams, 
e.g. accelerators with terminal voltages 2 4 MV. These 
accelerators are limited in number. Yet, backscattering 
techniques using the mom common accelerators (terminal 
voltage 5 2 MV) can reliably measure carbon concentra- 
tions as demonstrated by this paper. A large scatter in the 
carbon concentrations may occur depending on how the 
integrated cross section is calculated, and therefore it is 
critical that the scattering cross section be properly mea- 
sured in order to obtain reliable backscattering results. 
Since this cross section changes rapidly with incident 
beam energy it is necessary to calibrate the beam energy to 
within 5 keV. Finally, the importance of maintaining a [l] W.K. Chu, J.W. Mayer and M-A. Nicolet, Backscattering
