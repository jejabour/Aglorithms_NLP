Abstract 
Compounds of the general form Ru2(CO)4('qs,~'~-C~H4LCsH4 ), where L - CH2-, (CH02C-, C2H4- and (CH3)2Si., have been 
found to undergo photolysis in deuterobenzene or deuterotoluene to give 'twisted' ruthenium hydride complexes of the form 
[Ru(CO),][Ru(CO)2H]('r/s,'q'~:'oi-CsH4LC.~H.0. Reaction of these hydrides with chlorocarbons resulted in the formation of the 
corresponding chlorides which could be isolated and characterized by IR, S H and Z'~C NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. 
In the particular case of Ru:(CO)4['Os,v/S-CsH4(CH.02SiC~H4] a secondary photochemical reaction occurs with formation of 
[Ru(CO)2]:(/~-v/'~:~ s-CsH4)[ p,-(CH.02Si-(~'LC.~H 4)] in which Ru-Ru and Cp-Si bonds have been broken and new Ru=Cp and Ru=Si

1. Introduction 
Photolysis of Ru2(CO)4(v/S-C.~H02, 1, in solution is 
known to proceed by both radical and carbonyl loss 
mechanisms. Photolysis of i in the presence of CCl4 or 
ICsHIt yields Ru(CO)2 X(vrLC~H.~), where X -- CI and 
I respectively [1]. Eisenstadt et al. [2], have adapted this 
reaction to a high yield synthesis of Ru(CO).,X(~ 5- 
C~Hs), where X = Cl and Br, by photolysis of 1 in 
CX4. Photolyses in low temperature matrices have 
demonstrated that carbonyl loss results in the formation 
of linear Ru2(/z-CO).~(v/5-C~H.~),. [3]. The analogous 
triply carbonyl-bridged iron compound has been oh-

We have reported the synthesis of ring-coupled

and CH 4) leads to the fotTnation of an asymmetric 
carbonyl-loss product, Ru,(CO)3(r/5,~5-C.~H4CH 2C.~ - 
H4), in which all three carbonyi groups are terminal [3].

Knox et al. [8] have photolyzed ili in the presence of 
Ph2C z and isolated Ru2(CO)2(/.t.CO)(/z-o-:o-'- 
PhsCzX~Isols.CsH4CH2CsH4). In the course of our 
own studies of the photolysis of I11 with Ph2C 2 we 
consistently observed an additional trace orange product 
during chromatographic workup of the reaction mixture. 
Subsequent analysis of this product established that it 
did not contain a Ph2C 2 moiety and prompted us to 
examine the solution photolysis of Ill-VI in the ab- 
sence of potential ligands. This paper describes the 
results of these studies into the photoinduced structural 
reorganization of ring-coupled ruthenium compounds. A 
discussion of the detailed photochemistry and possible 
mechanism of this reaction will be reported elsewhere

2. Results 
The syntheses of Ru2(CO)4('r/s,'qS-CsH4LCsH4), 
where L--CH2-, !!1, (CH3)2C-, IV, C2H4-, V, and 
(CH3)2Si-, VI, have recently been described [7]. IR 
studies of these compounds have established that ill [8] 
and IV [7a] have solution state structures in which all 
carbonyl groups are terminal, whereas V and V! prefer 
conformations in which two of the carbonyl groups are 
bridging. Molecular structures of ili and V confirm that 
these structural preferences continue into the solid state. 
I:~C NMR of ill-V! established that rapid averaging of 
carbonyl groups occurs at room temperature, indicating 
that transient bridging-carbonyl forms exist in all cases. 
Photolysis of !!! in thoroughly degassed, deuterated 
benzene or toluene in a micro.photolysis cell (about I 
ml capacity) resulted in the formation of a new species, 
VII, whose IR spectrum contains bands at 2033, 2014, 
1974, and 1963 cm °t. The tH NMR spectrum of the 
photoproduct was characterized by a complex, seven 
proton resonance cyclopentadienyl ring region, an AB 
quartet for the bridging methylene group, and a ruthe- 
nium hydride resonance. Although one major product 
was produced in these photolyses, additional resonances 
are observed in all regions, suggesting that there may be 
several minor products. VII is very air sensitive and 
0 0 
0 0 reacts to give an insoluble red solid upon brief exposure 
to air. We have not been successful in obtaining a '3C 
NMR spectrum of VII. 
The red solid formed when VII reacts with air had 
IR bands at 1992 and 1776 cm -s which are very 
similar in position to those reported by Knox and 
coworkers for the tetramer, !!; thus we tentatively sug- 
gest that the red solid is a ring-coupled analog of If. 
The t H NMR spectrum of the red solid was exceedingly 
complex in the cyclopentadienyl ring region and we 
have not been able to successfully interpret the spec- 
trum. 
Deuterobenzene solutions of ill and IV in NMR 
tubes were rigorously degassed by freeze-pump-thaw 
techniques. The NMR tubes were placed in a Pyrex 
water jacket and photolyzed for 15 min using a 350 W 
high pressure Hg lamp. During this time the solutions 
changed color from light yellow to dark red. Under 
these conditions ill gave results similar to those from 
the micro-photolysis vessel, although greater quantities 
of the secondary ruthenium-hydride products were ob- 
served by this method. Microchromatography of the 
reaction mixtures (after reaction with dichloromethane 
or CCI4 and removal of solvent) recovered the compo- 
nent that was responsible for the red color and showed 
it to be identical to the red oxidation product described 
above. Like !!1, photolysis of IV gave several products, 
with the major product having seven proton resonances 
in the cyclopentadienyl ring region, two resonances in 
the methyl region and a ruthenium-hydride resonance. 
Reaction of VII with dichioromethane or CC!4 
yielded an orange crystalline product, Vlll. Vlll could 
also be prepared along with the known [Ru(CO)2)CI] z- 
(~5,T/S-CsH4CH2CsH 4) when the photolyses of !il 
were carried out in neat CCI4. VIII was the only 
product when !!! was photolyzed in 4:1 benzene:dichlo-

romethane. The IR spectrum of Viii contained four 
bands in the terminal carbonyl region at 2046, 2028, 
1989, and 1975 cm -i, The bands at 2046 and 1989 
cm-i are assigned to a CpRu(CO)2Ci moiety, while 
those at 2028 and 1975 cm -m are typical of 
CpRu(CO)2R groups. 
The 'H NMR spectrum of VIII contains a set of 
seven cyclopentadienyl ring proton resonances, two of 
which overla~, and an AB quartet for the methylene 
protons. The 3C NMR spectrum contained resonances 
for seven protonated ring carbons and three ipso car- 
bons. Four ruthenium carbonyi resonances and a methy- 
lene carbon resonance were also observed. COSY al- 
lowed assignment of ring proton resonances to the two 
rings, but full assignment of the resonances was not 
possible. The spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests 
a molecular structure in which one of the cyclopentadi- 
enyl rings is sigma bonded to a ruthenium atom while 
still retaining a second, pentahapto bonded ruthenium. 
This proposed structure was confirmed by X-ray crystal- 
lography (vide infra). 
Photolysis of IV in a 3:1 benzene:chloroform mix- 
ture resulted in effectively quantitative conversion of IV 
to a new compound, IX, which was found to be identi- 
cal to a trace side-product from the reaction of 
TI2[CsH4(CH3)2CCsH 4] with [CI2Ru(CO)3] 2 that we 
have previously reported. The molecular structure of IX 
was previously determined and established that the 
compound has a twisted structure. The structure of IX 
will be discussed along with that of VIII below. 
Photolysis of an NMR sample of V in deuteroben- 
zene resulted in the formation of two hydride species 
(Ru-H at - 10.38 and - 17.34 ppm), Both the ring and 
bridge proton regions of this spectrum were complex. 
An IR spectrum of the sample contained sharp bands at 
2032, 2028, and a broad band at 1976 cm° ~, similar to

those observed for Vll. Reaction of a solution contain- 
ing these hydrides with dichloromethane, or photolysis 
of V in CDC! 3 resulted in the formation of a yellow- 
orange product, X. X was found to have terminal 
stretching bands at 2045, 2034, and 1988 cm-', which 
are almost identical to those observed for VIii and IX. 
The 'H and '3C NMR spectra of X conform to its 
formulation as a twisted complex with one ~5-Cp ring 
and one 7/s:7/m-Cp ring. The ethylene-bridge resonances 
form a well resolved set of four doublets of doublets of 
doublets. COSY, NOESY, and I H-'3C correlation 
spectra were recorded and allowed a detailed analysis of 
the solution geometry of the compound. Coupling con- 
stants for the doublet of doublet of doublet pattern of 
the ethylene-bridge hydrogen resonances were obtained. 
These coupling constants, along with COSY interac- 
tions, permitted both the geminal relationships and 
bridge connectivities relative to the two rings to be 
established. Applying the Karplus relationship [10], the 
dihedral angle of the ethylene bridge was found to be 
about 45 ° . This angle is in keeping with that obtained 
using Dreiding stereomodels of the compound, A pro~ 
posed conformation of the complex and the numbering 
scheme used in the spectral assignments is presented in 
Fig, I. 
The bromo analog of X has been isolated as a 
side-product in the reaction of CzH4(CsH4TI)2/TIBr 
with [CI2Ru(CO)3] 2 and has been fully characterized 
[7b]. 
Photolysis of an NMR sample of Vl in deuteroben- 
zene gave rise to complex new resonances in the cy- 
ciopentadienyl ring region, two new methylsilyl reso- 
nances, and a ruthenium-hydride resonance indicative of 
the formation of a new hydride species analogous to the 
twisted species described above. Photolysis of Vl in 
neat CCl4 yielded a poorly soluble tan solid whose IR 
and IH NMR spectrum showed it to be [Ru(CO)2CI]2- 
[ 7/s, 7/s-CsH 4(CH 3)2SiCsH 4]. Column chromatography 
of the CCI 4 soluble components of the reaction mixture 
yielded a trace of a new compound, Xl. XI is the 
exclusive product when V! is photolyzed in a 4:1 
benzene:chloroform mixture. IR, 11-I and ~3C NMR of 
Xl are similar to those of the twisted compounds de- 
scribed above and are consistent with classification of

X! as the twist derivative of Vi with the formula 
[Ru(CO)2 IRu(CO)2Cil ~s,ns: n'-CsH 4(CH 3)aSiCsH 3]. 
COSY NMR spectra permitted some specific assign- 
ments to be made. Accidental overlap of the proton 
resonances of the hydrogens adjacent to the bridge on 
the ~/S-Cp ring (designated a-T/5-Cp) precluded exact 
assignment of H-3 and H-4; thus these have been 
designated simply as /~-~5-Cp. As in most cases, we 
have not been able to exactly assign protons H-8 and 
H-10 on ring 7/5:~?LCp by either COSY or NOESY 
spectroscopy. 
In contrast to the behavior of the carbon-bridged 
compounds described above, continued irradiation of 
solutions of V! gave rise to a second, non-hydride 
species that appeared to grow at the expense of the 
ruthenium-hydride compound. Column chromatography 
of the reaction mixture from a microscale photolysis of 
V! eluted a rapidly moving, very pale yellow compound 
that gave an almost colorless oil, Xll, upon removal of 
solvent. The IR spectrum of this compound consisted of 
four bands in the terminal carbonyl region. The simple 
t H NMR spectrum c~nsisted of four cyclopentadienyl 
ring proton resonances and a single methyl-silyl rose- 
nance. A (:](::-MS analysis of the compound showed it 
to have a parent mass of 500 Da and a fragmentation 
pattern consistent with sequential loss of four carbonyl 
groups. The starting material, VI, had a parent mass and 
fragmentation pattern that were effectively identical to 
those of XII, with the two compounds differing only in 
the relative amounts of the carbonyl-loss fragments and 
in their retention time on the chromatographic column. 
These data arc consistent with XII being a structural 
isomer of VI having a unique structure in which one of 
the cyclopentadienyl-silyl bonds has been broken along 
with the Ru-Ru bond and the molecule reformed with 
an Ru-~ILCp bond and an Ru-Si bond to give a 
molecule with the form [Ru(CO)z]z(/.~-T/s:III,CsH,I)- 
[ It-(CH ~)~ Si~-(~s.Cs H 4)], 
In order to clarify the relationship between the inter- 
mediate hydride and XII, a sample of VI was pho- 
tolyzed briefly. After recording a 'H NMR to establish 
the relative quantities of VI, hydride, and XII, the 
sample was stored in the dark at 23 °C, Spectra taken of this sample over a 15 h period demonstrated that the 
relative ratios of Vl and Xll did not change signifi- 
cantly, although the hydride slowly disappeared. Heat- 
ing a similar sample to 65 °C for 5 min resulted in the 
formation of a fine precipitate. NMR analysis showed 
significant depletion in the relative quantity of hydride 
present, but no change in the relative amounts of VI and 
XII. We cannot distinguish between the possibility that 
the hydride had thermally rearranged to give both VI 
and XII, or that traces of air were selectively reacting 
with the hydride. Photolyses conducted with optical 
filters, which only passed light shorter than 450 nm and 
between 400 and 500 nm, yielded both the hydride and 
Xll. Photolysis of VI in neat CCI4 yielded only XI, but 
Xll was formed along with XI when the photolysis was 
carried out in toluene with about 10% CCi 4. 
The apparent ease of formation of metal-to-ring cou- 
pling products in these photochemical reactions of 
ring-coupled ruthenium compounds prompted us to ex- 
amine the photolysis of an NMR sample of I in deuter- 
obenzene. A ~H NMR spectrt~m recorded immediately 
after photolysis revealed the prcsen,~e of several hydride 
products. The cyclopentadienyi ,ing region contained 
several resonances and it was not possible to identify 
any single species with any certainty. We have carried 
out similar reactions on a number of ring-substituted 
compounds of the general form Ru 2(CO)4(~/S-C s H 4R)2, 
where R -- CH~, CH2Ph, CHO, COCH 3, and COACH 3, 
and found that hydride products are formed in all cases. 
We have thus far been unsuccessful in cleanly isolating 
the chloride derivatives of these hydride species: how- 
ever, we strongly believe that the dominant products 
have the form Ru(CO)2(~s-CsH4R)(/~.T/s:~I-CsH~R).

gen that gave rise to the red tetrameric product, 11, 
reported by Knox and his coworkers. 
3. X-ray crystallography 
In order to definitively establish the structure of 
VIII, crystals were grown from dichloromethane-petro- 
leum ether by vapor diffusion in the cold. X-ray crystal- 
lographic analyses of these crystals revealed the unique, 
twisted structures presented in Fig. 2 in which one 
cyclopentadienyl ring is pentahapto to one ruthenium, 
while the second ring is monohapto to this ruthenium

and pentahapto to an Ru(CO)2CI moiety. With the 
exception of the methyl groups in the bridge of IX, the 
molecules of compounds VIII and IX are effectively 
superimposable, In both cases, the two rings are almost 
exactly perpendicular to one another. Each of the two 
geometrically similar ruthenium sites in the two 
molecules are of the 'three.legged piano stool' type. 
The interligand angles average about 90 °. No bond 
metric shows evidence of any unusual strain as an 
accommodation to the formation of the o" (Ru-Cp) 
bond. Crystallographic data are presented in Table I

4. Discussion 
The studies described above have revealed a previ- 
ously unobserved, photoinitiated rearrangement of 
ring-coupled cyclopentadienyirutheniumcarbonyl corn- 

18 T.E. BitterwoU et al. / Journal of Orgam~metallic Ckcmistry 514 (1996) 13-21 
pounds in which the Ru-Ru bond is broken, and new 
Ru-o,.Cp and Ru-H bonds are formed. Reaction of the 
hydride intermediates with various halocarbons give rise 
to isolable chloride derivatives. No parallel chemistry 
was observed with the iron analogue of iIl. However, 
we have recently found similar behavior in ring-coupled 
heterobimetallic compounds of the general formula 
RuM(CO)s(.qs,T/5-CsH4-L-C5H4 ), where M = Me or 
W and L - CH 2 or C(CH3) 2. as well as the bimetallic 
molybdenum compound, M2(CO)5(~5,7/5-C5H4CH2C5 - 
H4). These studies will be reported elsewhere. 
Perhaps germane to the mechanism of these rear- 
rangement reactions is the observation that photolyses 
of the various bridged compounds in neat chlorocarbons 
such as CCI 4 and CHCI3 give rise to the chloro deriva- 
tives, [Ru(CO)2CI]2(~/5,~5-CsH4LCsH4), and small 
quantities of the twist chlorides, whereas the twist com- 
pounds are efficiently produced in 4:1 benzene:halo- 
carbon mixtures. Photolysis of I in the presence of 
chlorocarbons to give Ru(CO)2CI(~/5-CsHs) is well 
known and is presumed to proceed by photochemical 
cleavage of the Ru-Ru bond to give CpRu(CO) 2 free 
radicals which in turn react with the chlorocarbons [I]. 
We anticipated that ring-coupling would have the effect 
of keeping the CpRu(CO) 2 radicals in close proximity, 
thus facilitating their thermal back-reaction to reform 
metal-metal bonds. In neat chlorocarbon solvents, it 
appears that the photochemically generated radicals can 
be efficiently intercepted to yield [Ru(CO)eCI]2[vls,v? "s- 
C~H4LCsH4] products. 
Whether a diradical intermediate is involved in the 
twist reaction has not yet been determined. Detailed 
photochemical studies to be reported elsewhere [9] indi- 
cate that carbonyloloss is also observed at the same 
wavelengths shown to be responsible for the twist reac- 
tion, thus the intermediacy of an unsaturated species 
cannot yet be ruled out. 
In the particular case of VI, it would appear that the 
twist hydride itself undergoes a photochemical reaction 
to yield Xil in which one CpRu(CO)2 moiety has 
effectively been rotated relative to its orientation in VI. 
A similar reaction has been reported by Sun et al. [11], 
in which Fe,(CO)4[v/s,v/S-CsH4(CH~)2SiCsH4] is ther- 
mally transformed into [Fe(CO)z],[/z-v/'~:l/I- 
(CH~)zSiCsH4]. Perhaps more relevant is the report by 
Vollhardt and Weidman [12] that the fulvalene deriva- 
tive, Ru=(CO)4(v/s,7/S-CsH4CsH4), undergoes a photo- 
chemical rearrangement to give [Ru(CO)2]z(~-T/5:?/I- 
C5H4) ~, which may be restored to its original form by 
heating. Voilhardt and Weidman tentatively ruled out a 
radical mechanism for this reaction because this process 
appeared to be unaffected by the presence of I M CCI~. 
In the light of the present results, it would appear that 
the mean lifetimes of a reactive intermediate may be 
sufficiently long in dilute CCI~ to allow for radical 
rearrangement to the observed product. 5. Experimental 
'H and t3C NMR spectra were recorded on either an 
IBM NR-300 MHz NMR spectrometer at the University 
of Idaho or a GE QE-300 MHz NMR spectrometer at 
the U.S. Naval Academy and were referenced to appro- 
priate solvent references. IR spectra were recorded on 
either a Perkin Elmer 1750 FTIR or a Bio-Rad Quali- 
matic FFIR. HPLC analyses were conducted on a Gow- 
Mac HPLC outfitted with a silica gel column using 30% 
THF in petroleum ether as an eluant. GC-mass spectral 
studies were conducted using a Hewlett Packard 5990 
GC-MS while the mass spectrum of VIII was recorded 
using a Finnigan mass spectrometer at the University of 
Vermont. Analyses were conducted by Galbraith Labo- 
ratories, Inc. of Knoxville, TN and Desert Analytics, 
Inc. of Tuscon, AZ. 
5. !. General photolysis procedures 
Photolyses were carried out using either an Ace 
Hanovia medium pressure lamp held in a water-cooled 
quartz jacket, or a UVP, Inc. 350 W high pressure 
mercury lamp. Optical filters were purchased from 
Corion, Inc. NMR samples for photolysis were prepared 
by either vacuum trap-to-trap transfer of the NMR 
solvent to an NMR tube containing the ruthenium com- 
pound, or by preparation of the solution followed by 
three freeze-pump-thaw cycles at high vacuum. Mi- 
croscale photolyses of 10-20 mg of sample were con- 
ducted in an Ace 'Micro No-Air' apparatus equipped 
with a quartz sample tube and a cold finger. Microscale 
photolysis samples were degassed by three freeze- 
pump-thaw cycles followed by a nitrogen backflush. 
NMR tubes were cooled during photolysis by a Pyrex 
water jacket and microscale photolyses were carried out 
using a cold finger. IR spectra of air sensitive reaction 
mixtures were prepared by transfer of sample in a 
nitrogen fllshed syringe to a nitrogen flushed IR cell 
outfitted with microsepta. The majority of the reactions 
reported in this work were conducted on either NMR 
tube or microscales, thus recovered samples were corre- 
spondingly small. As a result, mass spectrometry has 
been the primary tool for chemical analysis in these 
experiments. 
5.2. Photochemical studies of RuzfCO)4l~5.vlS-C~H~. 
¢H2 es H, !. m 
A solution of !11 in C6D 6 in an NMR tube was 
prepared by trap-to-trap transfer, and the solution was 
photolyzed using an Ace Hanovia lamp without filters. 
The NMR tube was approximately 5 cm from the lamp. 
The solution color changed from yellow-orange to red 
during this period. Spectra recorded after 2 h indicated 
the formation of a hydride species, Vii. IR: (C6D 6)

A microscale sample of Ill in C6H 6 was photolyzed 
for 2 h using an Ace Hanovia lamp, after which time 
dichloromethane was injected into the sample and the 
reaction mixture stirred for an additional hour. After 
removal of solvent, the residue was taken up in 1:1 
petroleum ether:.dichloromethane and chromatographed 
on a 5 mm × 150 mm alumina column. A yellow band 
was rapidly eluted which was stripped of solvent to give 
yellow-orange crystals of VIII, m.p. 156-158 °C. IR:

Microscale photolysis of IIi in CC!4 for 4 h using an 
Ace Hanovia lamp, resulted in the precipitation of an 
orange solid from the reaction mixture. IR and ~H NMR 
showed this solid to be identical to [Ru(CO)2CI]2(v/s, 
v/S-C s H 4CH 2C s H 41. Removal of solvent from the reac- 
tion mixture and chromatography as described above 
gave VIII as the sole additional reaction product. 
When solutions of the hydride, VII, were exposed to 
air, a red precipitate formed quickly. This red solid does 
not melt up to 300 °C. The compound is poorly soluble 
in all common solvents. IR: (CH2CI 2) 1945, 1766

poor quality with low signal to noise. Only high confi- 
dence resonances are reported. 
5.3. Photolysis of Ruz(CO)J'~,~S-C~H4(CH.~)zCCj - 
H, I, iv 
An NMR sample of IV was prepared by dissolving 
the compound in C6D 6 then degassing the solution with 
three freeze-pump-thaw cycles. The sample was placed 
in a Pyrex water jacket and photolyzed using a 350 W high pressure UV lamp for 24 min. JH NMR: (C6D 6) 
4.94 (IH, Cp), 4.76 (IH, Cp), 4.73 (1H, Cp), 4.68 (1H,

Photolysis of a 100 mg sample of IV in 3:1 
C6H6:CHCI 3 in a Pyrex vessel for 30 min using a 350 
W high pressure Fig lamp gave a red-orange solution. 
After removal of solvem, the solid was chro- 
matographed on alumina using 1:1 petroleum ether:.di- 
chloromethane as an eluant. An intense yellow band 
was eluted from the column which gave IX in quantita- 
tive yield. Physical and spectral properties of IX pre- 
pared in this manner were identical to a sample recov- 
ered as a by-product of the reaction of 
(CHj)2C(CsH4TI) 2 with [CI2Ru(CO)3] 2 and reported 
previously [7b]. 
5.4. Photochemical studies of Ruz(CO)~(~5,cI~.CsH4- 
C2H4CaH4), V 
Photolysis of an NMR sample of V in C6D6 for 50 
min at room temperature resulted in the appearance of 
Ru-H resonances at -10.38 and -17.34 ppm and a 
complex set of resonances in the ring and ethylene 
bridge regions. IR of the solution showed product bands 
at 2032, 2028, and 1976 cm -I. Upon addition of 
dichloromethane to the photolysis solution, new IR 
bands were found at 2045, 2033, and 1988 cm °l. 
HPLC of the products of this reaction contained one 
major product band (which was subsequently shown to 
be X by comparison with an authentic sample) and a 
second, lesser band whose identity has not yet been 
established. 
A 10 mg sample of V in neat CHCi~ in a micropho- 
tolysis cell was photolyzed for 30 rain using a 350 W 
high pressure Hg lamp. After removal of solvent, the 
resulting red solid was separated by chromatography on 
alumina using I:1 petroleum ether:dichloromethane as 
an eluant. The first yellow band was collected and 
stripped of solvent to give X as an orange crystalline 
solid. IR: (CDCI0 2042, 2032, 1978 cm-i. I H NMR:

5.5. Photolysis of Ruz(CO)J~Is,~S-Cs H4(CH3 )zSiCs - 
H,/. W 
NMR samples of Vl were photolyzed in both CeD e 
and C6DsCD 3 as solvents using the Ace Hanovia appa- 
ratus. Spectra recorded in the first 5-10 min of photoly- 
sis contained complex ring regions, new Me2Si reso- 
nances at 0.59 and 0.33 ppm, and a Ru-H resonance at 
-10.41 ppm. Upon continued photolysis, ring reso- 
nances at 5.10, 4.88. 4.61 and 4.45 and a Me2Si 
resonance at 0.60 ppm increased while resonances asso- 
ciated with the hydride species decreased. After 2 h of 
photolysis only traces of the Ru-H species could be 
observed. Removal of solvent followed by chromatogra- 
phy on a !0 cm × 3 mm alumina column with !:1 
petroleum ether:dichloromethane as an eluant recovered 
Xll as a pale yellow oil. IR: (CH2CI 2) 2032, 1999,

444 (M+-2CO), 416 (M+-3CO), 388 (M*-4CO). 
Similar NMR-scale photolyses were carried out using 
optical filters (A < 450 nm) and 400 < ,~ < 500 nm) 
without affecting the observed results, A sample of Vi 
in C6DsCD ~ was photolyzed for 5 rain and shown by 
NMR to contain both hydride and Xll, After storage 
overnight in the dark, the sample showed complete 
decomposition of hydride, but no change in the relative 
amounts of V! and Xli. In a similarly prepared sample, 
the hydride was decomposed after 5 rain in a 65 °(2 bath 
with no change in the relative amounts of VI and Xll. 
Photolysis of VI in neat CCI 4 resulted in the precipi- 
tation of [Ru(CO)2CI]2['qs,~S-CsH,,(CH3)zSi.CsH4I as 
a tan solid, IR: (CH2CI 2) 2055, 2005 cm -t. 'H NMR:

workup as described above. 
5.6. Crystal structure determination 
A summary of crystallographic data is given in Table 
I. A crystal of VIII was mounted with epoxy cement on 
glass fibers. Unit-cell parameters were obtained by the 
least squares refinement of the angular settings of 24 
reflections (20 ° ~ 20 < 25°), Photographic evidence de- 
termined that the crystal belonged to a monoclinic 
system. Systematic absences in the diffraction data indi- 
cated either of the C-centered space groups C2/c or 
Cc. The noncentrosymmetric alternative, Cc, was first 
suggested by the E-statistics (e.g. I E 2 - I I = 0.74) and 
confirmed by the results of refinement. The resulting 
two independent molecules of VIII are nearly identical. 
The structure was solved by direct methods and 
completed by subsequent difference Fourier synthesis. 
All non-hydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined, 
and all hydrogen atoms were treated as idealized, 
updated isotropic contributions (dCH--0.96 ~), 
SHELXTL (5.1) software was used on all calculations 
[13].
