ABSTRACT 
The mammalian ovarian cycle is a strictly regulated process that is dependent on the intimate 
interactions among the 3 cell types in the follicle - theta, granulosa, and oocyte. The cycle has been shown 
to be controlled by gonadotropins as well as locally produced peptide factors. In this study, an in vitro 
culture system was used to study the roles of 2 locally produced ovarian peptide factors, transforming 
growth factor- 0, (TGF-P, ) and activin-A, on porcine granulosa cell steroidogenesis. Gonadotropin- 
stimulated cultured porcine granulosa cells (from medium-sized follicles) were pretreated with IO0 &ml 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) for 48 h and then treated with I ng/ml TGF-P,, 100 ng/ml activin-A, 
TGF-0, plus activin-A, or received no treatment (control) for 48 h. From our previous studies, the 
concentrations of the 2 growth factors were determined to produce maximal antisteroidogenic effects in 
porcine granulosa cells. Progesterone (P4) production, estradiol- l7jJ (6 ) production, and aromatase 
activity for gonadotropin-stimulated porcine granulosa cells treated with TGF-P,, activin-A, and TGF-0, 
plus activin-A were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced fromthat of the control. The same procedures were 
conducted on basal steroidogenesis studies in which no pretreatment with FSH was performed. Both P, 
and Ez production and aromatase activity for porcine granulosa cells treated with TGF-B,, activin-A and 
TGF-P, plus activin-A were significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited compared with the control. Our results 
indicate that both TGF-/3, and activin-A can inhibit FSH-stimulated and basal steroidogeneses in porcine 
granulosa cells and, thus, may act as local atretic factors during follicular development. When the 2 growth 
factors were given in combination at concentrations that would produce maximal steroidogenic inhibition, 
they were not able to produce a synergistic effect. These results are consistent with the current theory that 
TGF-0, and activin-A may act via the same messenger system, a serine-threonine kinase.

INTRODUCTION 
During each estrous cycle, in the mammal, a cohort of quiescent primordial follicles is recruited 
to develop. However, only a select few, in polytocous animals, eventually mature to a stage capable of 
ovulation. Most of the developing follicles undergo atresia and degenerate. This selective process is at 
least partially regulated by gonadotropins, but many local factors are also implicated (1). 
The general morphology of a mammalian ovarian follicle consists of an outer layer of theta cells 
and inner layers of granulosa cells which surround the oocyte. The 3 cell types within the follicle (theta, 
granulosa, and oocyte) interact both structurally and functionally, incorporating endocrine, paracrine, and 
autocrine processes. In the granulosa cell, these processes regulate cellular differentiation, which 
contributes to the state of follicular development (14). Differentiation of the follicle beyond the small 
follicle is characterized by increased aromatase activity, androgen synthesis, and estrogen synthesis (14). 
Transforming growth factor-p (TGF-P) and activin are 2 growth factors which belong to the same 
family as inhibin. Both TGF-0 (IO) and activin (4,23) have been isolated in mammalian ovaries; TGF-B 
is an approximately 25 kDa peptide with homodimeric subunits and is produced by almost all mammalian 
cells investigated, normal and transformed (I 2). The TGF-B family of peptide growth factors currently 
includes 5 members, TGF-P, to TGF-P,. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that TGF-P, can 
regulate progesterone (PJ production in gonadotropin-stimulated porcine granulosa cells in vitro (5,6). 
Activin is an approximately 24 kDa peptide consisting of disulfide dimers of inhibin j3-subunits. The 3 
members of activin are named depending on the dimeric constituents of inhibin PA- and/or pa-subunits. 
Activin possesses demonstrable roles in reproductive physiology both in vivo and in vitro (9). Our 
laboratory has also shown that activin-A, which is formed from a homodimer of inhibin j3,-subunits, can 
inhibit porcine granulosa cell steroidogenesis in vitro (25). 
Since TGF-P and activin are protein products, they presumably act by a transmembrane receptor. 
Although receptors for TGF-P and activin have been identified, their mechanisms of action are indefinite 
(I 8.24). Both factors bind to known receptors, a class (type II) of which belongs to a new subfamily of 
transmembrane protein serine kinases (I 9). Expression cloning of cDNA for type II TGF-0 receptors 
indicates that it is closely related to the activin receptor (ActRII) (I 7). 
In the current study, we treated porcine granulosa cells with doses of TGF-p, (I ng/ml) and activin- 
A ( 100 ng/ml) that were determined in previous experiments to produce maximal inhibition of 
steroidogenesis (525). In order to assess the effects of these factors on cultured porcine granulosa cell 
differentiation, we measured FSH-stimulated and basal P4 productions, estradiol (I$) productions, and 
aromatase activities, three indicators of differentiation beyond the small follicle stage. We also treated cells 
with a combination of TGF-P, and activin-A to assess any synergistic effects of these 2 growth factors on 
porcine granulosa cell differentiation. At doses that produce maximal inhibition, if TGF-0, and activin-A 
utilize the same messenger system, then their combination would not be expected to produce synergistic 
effects. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals 
Bovine albumin, gelatin (from swine skin), Triton X- 100, progesterone (P4), estradiol- I7p (EJ and 
Theriogenology 1465 
activated charcoal were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Sodium phosphate 
monobasic (NaH2P0,), sodium azide, and ScintiPrep 2 were purchased from Fisher Scientific Company 
(Fair Lawn, NJ). Monoclonal antibodies to Pq and E were obtained from Biodesign International 
(Kennebunkport, ME). Purified ether and methanol were acquired from JT Baker, Incorporated 
(Phillipsburg, NJ). Sodium phosphate diphasic (Na,HPO,) was purchased from EM Science (Cherry Hill, 
NJ). Sodium chloride was obtained from Jenneile Chemical Company (Cincinnati, OH). Dextran T-70 
was acquired from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ). Toluene was purchased from Mallinckrodt, incorporated 
(Paris, KY). 
Porcine Granulosa Cell Culture 
All media used contained Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle/Ham’s F- I2 medium mixture (DME/F- 12, 
Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 250 rig/L amphotericin B, 100 It-J/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml 
streptomycin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY). Additional supplementations are mentioned as 
needed. 
Porcine granulosa cell culture procedures were adopted from Akira et al (2). Porcine ovaries 
obtained from a local slaughterhouse were transported on ice within 30 min of slaughter to the laboratory. 
The ovaries were then soaked in 70% ethanol for approximately I min and washed IO times with double- 
distilled water. Granulosa cells were obtained by aspirating medium-sized follicles (2 to 5 mm in diameter) 
with a 20-gauge needle and a IO-cc syringe. Follicular fluids were pooled and centrifuged for 5 min at 
approximately 200 x g. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended by gentle mixing in 
DME/F- I2 and recentrifuged. Removal of supernatant, resuspension, and centrifugation was repeated. 
After removing the remaining supernatant, the cells were suspended in DME/F- 12 supplemented (DME/F- 
12/S) with I pg/ml insulin (Sigma), I II-J/ml thrombin (Sigma), and IO pg/ml low density lipoprotein 
(Sigma). Cells were then seeded into 24-well Corning culture plates (#X820, Corning Glass Works, 
Corning, NY) at a density of 2.0 x IO5 live cells/well. The number of live cells was determined by trypan 
exclusion method. The wells had been previously coated with IO% fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone, Logan, 
UT) by adding 1.0 ml DME/F-I 2/S plus 10% FCS to each well 18 to 24 h prior to seeding. The 10% FCS 
media was completely removed approximately I h prior to seeding, and FCS coating was used to enhance 
cell attachment. Each well contained a total volume of I .O ml DME/F- 12/S. The cells were cultured ~OI 
48 h (5% CO,, 95% air, 37” C) at which time porcine granulosa cells reached a monolayer of close to 
IOO% confluency. For gonadotropin stimulation, the wells were then washed 3 times with DME/F- 12, and 
I .O ml DME/F-12/S containing 100 ng/ml follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH, ovine NIH-FSH-SY, 
National Institutes of Health) was added to each well. The cells were allowed to incubate (5% CO,, 95% 
air, 37” C) for another 48 h. In the basal steroidogenesis study, the cells were washed 3 times and 
incubated (5% CO?, 95% air, 37” C) with DME/F-12/S for 48 h. Media were then removed and the cells 
were treated with control media (DMEIF-12/S only), I ng/ml TGF-0, (from porcine platelets, R&D 
Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 100 ng/ml activin-A, or TGF-P, plus activin-A in DME/F-12/S for 48 hours. 
Media and cells were collected at the end of treatment for P, and E? radioimmunoassay (RIA) and protein 
assay, respectively. 
Radioimmunoassay (RlA) 
The RLA procedures for Pd and E, measurements follow the methods described by Bartke et al (3). 
Before steroids were extracted from media samples, [I ,2,6,7-ZH]-P, (0.0 I8 yCi: DuPont NEN, Boston, 
MA) or ]2,4,6,7-‘H(N)]estradiol (0.018 pCi; DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) was added to each sample for 
measurement of extraction efficiency. Aliquots of media were mixed with tritiated steroid (0. I8 uCi) and 
monoclonal anti-steroid antibody (Sigma) and then incubated at room temperature and at 4°C

charcoal (Sigma), and the radioactivity of the bound fraction was measured on a liquid scintillation counter. 
Both the P., and Er concentrations were determined from a standard curve ranging from 12.5 to IO0 pg/ml. 
Steroid concentrations were expressed as pg/pg cell protein. 
Aromatase Activity Assay 
Immediately after media were collected for P, and E2 RIA, cells in each well were cultured with 
2 pCi [ Ip-‘HI-androstenedione (Amersham, Amersham, UK) in I .O ml DMEW12/S for 3 h. As 
previously described (3), aromatase activity was determined by measuring the amount of ‘H-H,0 released 
into the media after the 3-h exposure time. Aromatase activities were expressed as pmol ‘H-HI0 
released/pg protein. 
Protein Assay 
Protein contents of the cells were determined by Bio-Rad microassay techniques (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Briefly, 0.8 ml of 0. I N NaOH (Sigma) in double distilled water was added 
to each well after removal of media. The NaOH solution was then removed and mixed with 0.2 ml Bio- 
Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) and absorbance

Statistical Analyses 
For all experiments, the results are presented as mean * SEM for 6 replicate cultures of each 
treatment. Each experiment utilized cells from different pools of granulosa cells, and each was repeated 
at least twice. The absolute steroid production values are often very different among batches of granulosa 
cells. Therefore, data shown for all assays performed on FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis were performed 
on the same pool of granulosa cells. Data shown for basal steroidogenesis were performed on a different 
pool of granulosa cells. Additionally, only representative experiments are reported rather than pooled data 
from all replicate experiments. Data were evaluated with one-way analysis of variance. Post-tests were 
performed using the Bonferroni multiple comparisons procedure. A P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.

DISCUSSION 
It has become apparent through recent research that growth factors produced by theta and 
granulosa cells may locally modulate ovarian cell proliferation, differentiation, steroidogenesis and 
angiogenesis (I 5). This study demonstrated that 2 growth factors, TGF-P, and activin-A, can inhibit 
gonadotropin-stimulated and basal steroidogeneses in cultured porcine granulosa cells from medium-sized 
follicles. Both of these growth factors have been isolated within the mammalian ovary (4,10,23) and have 
been previously shown in our laboratory to possess steroidogenic regulatory capabilities in cultured porcine 
granulosa cells (5,6,25). More specifically, this study examined the ability of TGF-P, and activin-A to 
regulate the biosynthetic pathways for androgen and estrogen, parameters for differentiation beyond the 
small follicle stage (14). 
Both TGF-P, (I @ml) and activin-A (I 00 r&ml) were able to attenuate P4 and E, production and 
aromatase activity, as assessed by 3H-Hz0 release from [I p’ HI-androstenedione. Our data show that 
1470 Theriogenology 
suppression of E, production by both growth factors is at least in part due to suppression of aromatase 
activities. The actions of TGF-P, are not surprising since it has been demonstrated to also inhibit 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH receptor formations in porcine granulosa cells, actions that suggest an, 
atretic role in follicular development (I 5). This study supports the atretic role theory. One mechanism 
through which TGF-0, can inhibit FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis is through the aforementioned inhibition 
on FSH receptor formation. TGF-0, can also inhibit basal steroidogenesis, which suggests that this growth 
factor can more directly regulate steroid enzyme activities such as aromatase. If TGF-0, can truly suppress 
FSH receptor formation and, therefore, inhibit FSH-stimulated differentiation and steroidogenesis in 
porcine granulosa cells as well as suppress steroidogenic enzyme activities directly, then TGF-P, is 
potentially a major regulator of follicular atresia. However, this simplified and appealing theory is 
confounded by our previous finding that TGF-II,, in specific conditions, can also stimulate steroidogenesis 
in porcine granulosa cells (6). The exact role of TGF-0, in porcine granulosa cells may not be clarified 
until we understand the role of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic factors in the regulation of TGF-9, 
expression in the ovary. 
Transforming growth factor-p has demonstrated vast abilities in many different tissues (I I). The 
actions of TGF-P often depend on the presence of specific environmental conditions, varying with cell type, 
presence of growth factors, and presence of other constituents; TGF-P stimulates proliferation in rat 
granulosa cells (l3), but inhibits growth in pig granulosa cells (7). Our laboratory has shown that TGF-P, 
can stimulate P4 synthesis in granulosa cells isolated from PMSG-stimulated mature rats (8) and inhibit P, 
production in cultured porcine granulosa cells (5.6). Within the same species and cell type, manipulations 
of environmental conditions have also produced opposing action (6,22). In this study, conditions 
permissive for the antisteroidogenic effects of TGF-0, were established to allow comparison with the 
antisteroidogenic activities of activin-A. 
Activin belongs in the same family of proteins as TGF-P. As with its familial counterpart, TGF-0, 
activin-A exhibits species-specific modulation of gonadotropin-induced differentiation of granulosa cells. 
Activin-A stimulated FSH-induced steroidogenesis and aromatase activity in rat granulosa cells (16.21). 
In contrast, this study demonstrated that activin-A inhibits FSHinduced and basal steroidogenesis and 
aromatase activity in porcine granulosa cells. It is unknown whether activin-A has any effect on 
gonadotropin receptor synthesis in granulosa cells. More information is needed on the effect of activin and 
its regulation in the ovary, with specific emphasis on changes in activin’s role as associated with changes 
in stage of follicular development. Like TGF-0, activin’s differential role in the follicle may depend on cell 
type, presence of other growth factors, and specific intra- and extracellular environments. It has been 
suggested that activin may function to establish and maintain the dominant follicle(s) during the 
preovulatory period, and to suppress the nondominant follicles (9). Our study indicates that activin-A may 
act as an atretic factor on medium-sized follicles, 
Although receptors for TGF-0, and activin-A have been identified, a consensus second messenger 
system has largely been unidentified until recently (18,24). Transforming growth factor-o, binds 
predominantly to the type II receptor. Expression cloning of the cDNA for the type II TGF-fi and activin 
(A&II) receptors disclose that they are closely related and belong to a new subfamily of transmembrane 
protein serine/threonine kinases (I 7,I9). This study evaluated the synergistic actions of maximal doses of 
TGF-P, and activin-A on porcine granulosa cell steroidogenesis. Since the 2 factors did not act 
synergistically in either gonadotropin-stimulated or basal studies, we speculate that they may act via the 
same or related second messenger systems. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that activin-A and 
TGF-P, share the same second messenger system, a serinelthreonine kinase. It must also be noted that our 
data does not exclude the possibility that TGF-P, and activin-A may act via different second messenger 
systems that, perhaps, converge downstream at a common pathway or that may act in a competitive fashion 
Theriogenology 1471 
to inhibit steroidogenesis in porcine granulosa cells. 
This study has presented data which suggest that TGF-l3 and activin-A are potential inducers of 
atresia in porcine follicles. By their abilities to inhibit both basal and FSH-stimulated steroidogeneses, these 
growth factors present as major regulators of follicular differentiation. As mentioned previously. both 
factors also possess differential functions that are dependent on microenvironmental conditions, The 
abilities to respond in a differential manner to the specific environment may confer an adaptive function 
to these growth factors. The functions of the growth factors adapt to the environment, allowing porcine 
granulosa cells to respond appropriately. Since TGF-P, can stimulate and suppress porcine granulosa cell 
steroidogenesis, it may be the local factor that senses environmental conditions and determines whethei 
the follicle will develop or undergo atresia during the estrous cycle
