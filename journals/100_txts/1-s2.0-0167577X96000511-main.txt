Abstract 
Alumina long fiber (22 vol%)/alumina matrix composites were formed by infiltration of aqueous alumina suspensions 
into alumina fiber-sheets and sintered in air or in vacuum at lOOO-1400°C. The fracture behaviour and strength of the 
composites were interpreted in relation to the following factors: strength of the alumina matrix, sintering between alumina 
fibers and matrix at the interfaces, coating effect of inert material over the surface of alumina fibers and degree of adhesion 
of interfaces.

1. Introduction 
Continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix com- 
posites have been intensively studied in recent years 
to achieve their high reliability based on the high 
toughness and ductility at high temperatures. Among 
the many kinds of long fibers, Si-C-O and Si-Ti- 
C-O fibers are well incorporated with lithium alumi- 
nate glass [1,2], mullite [3], silicon carbide [4-81 or 
silicon nitride matrix [9-l 11. The ceramic matrix 
composites with the above non-oxide fibers prefer an 
inert gas atmosphere or a low oxygen pressure atmo-

life of materials. The attractive composites for use in 
air are oxide fiber-reinforced oxide matrix compos- 
ites. However, compared with the study of composite 
materials using non-oxide long fibers, the oxide 
fiber/oxide matrix systems have been poorly inves- 
tigated because of the difficulty in controlling inter- 
facial strength which is influenced by the sintering 
process. The purpose of this work is to basically 
understand the nonlinear fracture behavior of alu- 
mina fiber/alumina matrix composites in relation to 
the sintering process. The long alumina fiber (22 
vol%)/alumina matrix composites have been formed 
by pouring aqueous alumina suspensions into the 
open spaces of alumina fiber-sheets and sintered at 
1 OOO- 1400°C in air or vacuum (0.01 Pa).

2. Experimental procedure 
A high-purity alumina powder with the chemical 
composition of 99.95 wt% Al,O, and 0.05 wt% 
MgO (average particle size 0.5 pm>, supplied by 
Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co., Ltd. Japan, was 
ball-milled with distilled water for 3 h to prepare the 
aqueous alumina suspensions of 48.7 ~01% solids. In 
the alumina suspensions, polyacrylic ammonium 
(dispersant) of 0.6 wt% and acryl type emulsion 
(binder) of 0.6 wt% against the weight of alumina 
powder were added before ball-milling. The supplied 
alumina yarn of 1000 filament consisted of o-alumina 
fibers of IO p_m diameter (Mitsui Mining Co., Japan). 
The alumina fibers, 85 mm long, were attached to a 
polypropylene frame to make unidirectional alumina 
fiber-sheets. The aqueous alumina suspension was 
poured into the open spaces of alumina fiber-sheet at 
a reduced pressure of 1 kPa. The alumina sheets of 
nine layers (300 p,m thickness/sheet) were lami- 
nated under a pressure of 17 kPa and dried in air at 
1 10°C. Some alumina fiber-sheets were dipped into a 
EN suspension of 2 ~01% solids so as to coat the 
surface of the alumina fibers with hexagonal BN 
particles, 7 pm size (purity > 99.5 wt%, Denki Ka- 
gaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, Japan). The BN sus- 
pension contained polyvinylalcohol (I wt%) and an 
acryl type emulsion of 0.23 wt% against the weight 
of suspension. Green composites were heated by an 
electric furnace at a rate of S”C/min to 1 OOO- 1400°C 
in air (KSH-2, Advantec Toyo Ltd., Japan) or in 
vacuum (0.01 Pa, VCH-161616, Japan Hayes Ltd., 
Japan) and sintered for I h. Bulk densities of the 
sintered alumina fiber/alumina matrix composites 
were measured by the Archimedes method in 
kerosene. A sintered sample was cut to five test 
specimens 35 mm long, 4 mm wide and 3 mm thick. 
parallel to the direction of long fibers. The flexural 
strengths of the test specimens, polished with No. 
600 SIC abrasive paper, were measured at room 
temperature using the three-point flexural method 
over a span length of 30 mm and a crosshead speed 
of 0.05 mm (AGlOTA, Shimazu Corporation, Japan). 
The average strength was calculated from the data 
for five specimens. The microstructures of the com- 
posites were examined by scanning electron mi- 
croscopy (JSM-840, JEOL Ltd, Japan). 3. Results and discussion 
Fig. I shows the density of monolithic alumina 
and alumina fiber (I 1 vol%)/alumina matrix com- 
posites sintered in air and in vacuum. Apparent 
densification of the alumina and composites occurred 
at temperatures above 1200°C. The sinterability of 
both samples was higher in an atmosphere of air 
rather than in vacuum. As seen in Fig. I, the incor- 
poration of alumina fibers into an alumina matrix 
reduced the materials transport during heating but 
may not restrict the full densification of the compos- 
ites at higher temperatures above 1400°C. 
Fig. 2 shows the stress-strain curves for alumina 
fiber (22 vol%)/alumina matrix composites sintered 
at lOOO-1400°C in air. The monolithic alumina sin- 
tered at IOOO- 1400°C in air fractured with a linear 
relation of stress-strain. The observation of the frac- 
ture surface of the alumina sintered at 1400°C indi- 
cated that cracks propagated through grain bound- 
aries of 0.5-l .5 pm grains. The fracture behavior 
and strength of the alumina fiber/alumina matrix 
composites changed with sintering temperature. 
The low-density composites sintered at lOOO- 
1100°C showed a nonlinear fracture behavior associ- 
ated with the pull-out of alumina fibers in the porous 
matrix (Fig. 3). Though the alumina matrix was 
porous and moderate, the pull-out of alumina fibers 
was observed. An increase of the sintering tempera- 
ture to above 1200°C provided a linear fracture 
behavior. The strength of the composites was com- 
pared with that of monolithic alumina as a function 
of sintering temperature, as shown in Fig. 4a. A 
higher strength was measured in the composites than 
in the monolithic alumina sintered at 1000-l 100°C.

The above results, shown in Fig. 2 and 4a, suggest 
that (1) the nonlinear fracture behavior of the low- 
density composites is associated with the weak 
strength of the interfaces between alumina fibers and 
the matrix, which causes the bridging and pull-out 
effects of alumina fibers, (2) the relatively high 
strength of the composites sintered at 1000-l 100°C 
is ascribed to the higher flexural strength of the 
alumina fibers than alumina matrix, (3) the linear 
fracture behavior of the composites sintered at 
1200- 1400°C arises from the sintering between the 
alumina fibers and the matrix which immobilizes the 
fibers in the matrix [2], and (4) the flexural strength 
of the composites sintered at 1200-14OO”C, which 
was lower than the strength of the corresponding 
matrix, is dominated by the size of the defects 
formed at the interfaces between fibers and the ma- 
trix. That is, the high strength of the composites that 
show a nonlinear fracture behavior may be a result

of: (1) the higher strength of the fiber as compared to 
that of the matrix, (2) dense matrix transfers the 
applied stress to the fibers, (3) a weak interfacial 
strength causing bridging and pull-out effects of the 
fibers and (4) no defects at the interfaces. 
The fracture behavior of the composites sintered 
in vacuum was similar to that of composites sintered 
in air. The strength of monolithic alumina and com- 
posites sintered in vacuum is shown in Fig. 4b. The 
composites sintered at 1000-l 100°C showed a non- 
linear fracture behavior associated with the delami- 
nation along the interfaces between alumina fibers 
and matrix. Use of the BN particle-coated alumina 
fibers enhanced the nonlinearity of fracture behavior 
of composites up to 1300°C of sintering temperature. 
Fig. 5 shows the pull-out of short length of alumina 
fibers with BN-particles in the alumina matrix sin- 
tered at 1300°C. The strength of the composites 
using BN particle-coated fibers was slightly lower 
than that of composites using alumina fibers without 
BN particle coating. The above results suggest that 
(1) BN particles prevent the sintering between alu- 
mina fibers and the matrix and enhance the bridging

and pull-out of alumina fibers against applied stress, 
(2) a main crack propagates through the weak matrix 
due to the low transmittance of applied stress to 
alumina fibers, (3) increase of the sintering tempera- 
ture promotes the sintering between the alumina 
matrix and the BN particle-coated alumina fibers to 
form strong interfaces, resulting in brittle fracture of 
the composites, and (4) partial sintering at the inter- 
faces produces the defect controlling the flexural 
strength. The above interpretation of the fracture 
behavior of composites using BN particle coated- 
alumina fibers leads to the following conclusions: (1) 
coating of long fibers with chemically inert materials 
should homogeneously cover all the surface of fibers 
to prevent the partial sintering at the interfaces at a 
high temperature, (2) dense matrix is needed to 
transmit the applied stress to fibers in addition to 
increasing the fracture resistance of composites and 
(3) highly adhesive interfaces are recommended so 
as not to produce the origin of fracture to be at the 
interfaces. 
4. Conclusions 
Long alumina fiber (22 vol%)/alumina matrix 
composites have been formed by infiltration of aque- 
ous alumina suspensions into fiber-sheets and sin- 
tered at IOOO-1400°C in air and in vacuum (0.01 
Pa>. Densification of the composites occurred at 
temperatures above 1200°C. A nonlinear fracture 
curve of stress-strain was measured in the low-den- 
sity composites sintered below 1 lOO”C, and showed 
that the strength was higher than that of the corre- sponding matrix. An increase in sintering tempera- 
ture caused an increase of the strength of the matrix 
but resulted in a brittle fracture behavior. The strength 
of the composites sintered at 1300- 1400°C was lower 
than that of the matrix. Coating of the alumina fibers 
with BN particles enhanced the nonlinearity of the 
fracture behavior of the composites up to a sintering 
temperature of 1300°C. 
Based on the above experimental results, it was 
concluded that the high-strength composites showing 
a nonlinear fracture behavior may be satisfied with: 
(1) higher strength of fibers compared to that of the 
matrix, (2) dense matrix to transmit the applied stress 
to the fibers and to increase the fracture resistance of 
the composites, (3) homogeneous coating of long 
fibers with chemically inert materials so as to pre- 
vent partial sintering at the interfaces and to give a 
weak interfacial strength for enhancing the bridging 
and pull-out effects of the fibers, and to obtain 
highly adhesive interfaces so as not to produce the 
origin of fracture to be at the interfaces.
