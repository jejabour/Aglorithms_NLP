Abstract 
The reaction of thiazole (Tz) with diorganotin(IV) dihalides yielded compounds of type [SnR2X2(Tz)2] (R = Me, Et, Ph; X = C1, Br). 
The structure of dichlorodiphenylbis(thiazole)tin(IV) was determined by X-ray diffraction. The crystals are monoclinic (space group 
P21/c) and consist of discrete trans-SnPhECl2(Tz) 2 units with the metal atom coordinated to two C1 atoms, two phenyl carbons, and the 
N atoms of two thiazole rings. MSssbauer and IR spectra suggest similar trans-stereochemistry for the other complexes prepared. The 
behavior of these compounds in solution was studied by conductimetry and NMR techniques. 
Keywords: Tin; Thiazole; Mbssbauer spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Crystal structure 
1. Introduction 
In previous work [1] we prepared and in some cases 
studied the crystallography of several dialkyltin(IV) 
complexes of type [SnR2X2L 2 ] (R = Me, Et, Bu; X = 
C1, Br; L an imidazole or pyrazole) in order to investi- 
gate the steric influence of the different substituents on 
the structure of the compounds. This study was recently 
extended to diaryltin(IV) derivatives by the preparation 
of dichlorodiphenylbis(pyrazole)tin(IV) [2]. In all these 
compounds the ligands L have an N-H group that can 
take part in hydrogen bonding, and hydrogen bonds 
were in fact detected in the compounds studied crystal- 
lographically. To investigate the influence of the ab- 
sence of such bonds on the orientation of the azole ring 
and the overall structure, we prepared the complexes 
[SnR2X2(Tz) 2] (R--Me, Et, Ph; X=C1, Br; Tz= 
thiazole). This paper describes their preparation and 
characterization, and the crystal structure of the 
dichlorodiphenyl compound.

X-ray data collection and reduction. A colourless pris- 
matic crystal was mounted on a glass fibre for data 
collection in an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 automatic diffrac- 
tometer [3]. Cell constants and an orientation matrix for 
data collection were obtained by least-squares refine- 
ment of the diffraction data from 25 reflections in the 
range 6.8 ° < 0 < 13.6 °. Data were collected at 293 K 
using Mo K a radiation (A = 0.71073 ,~) and the to/20 
scan technique, and were corrected for Lorentz and 
polarization effects. An empirical absorption correction 
was made [4]. Table 1 summarizes the crystal data, 
experimental details and refinement results.

The mixture was stirred for a short time, the solvent 
then partly evaporated off, and the white solid formed 
filtered off and dried in vacuo. Crystals suitable for

2.3. Physical measurements 
Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo-Erba 
1108 apparatus. Melting points were determined using a 
Biichi apparatus. IR spectra were recorded with Nujol 
mulls or KBr discs on a Nicolet FT-IR 55XC20F spec- 
trometer. Conductivities were determined with a WTW- 
LF3 conductivity meter. M~Sssbauer spectra were deter- 
mined at 80.0 K in a constant acceleration apparatus 
with a Cal19mSnO3 source and 6 referred to SnO 2. 1H 
(250.13 MHz) and 13C (62.83 MHz) NMR spectra were 
recorded in CDC13 at room temperature on a Bruker 
WM-250 and referred to TMS. Table 1

Structure solution and refinement. The structure was 
solved by direct methods [5], which revealed the posi- 
tions of all non-hydrogen atoms, and refined on F by a 
full-matrix least-squares procedure using anisotropic 
displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. 
The hydrogen atoms were located in the Fourier differ- 
ence maps and included in the structure factor calcula- 
tions as fixed contributions (Bis o = 4.0 ~x 2 ) but their 
positional parameters were not refined. A secondary 
extinction correction was applied [6]. When all 
shift/e.s.d, ratios were less than 0.001, the agreement 
factors were those listed in Table 1. Atomic scattering 
factors were taken from Ref. [7]. Molecular graphics 
were obtained with SCHA~CAL [8]. Final atomic parame- 
ters and bond distances and angles are listed in Tables 2 
and 3 respectively. Table 3

3.1. Description of the structure of [SnPh 2 CI2(Tz) 2 ] 
The molecular structure of [SnPh2C12(Tz) 2 ] is shown 
in Fig. 1 together with the numbering scheme. The Sn 
atom is octahedrally coordinated to two C1 atoms, two 
phenyl C atoms, and the N atoms of two thiazole 
ligands in an all-trans configuration. The deviation from 
the ideal octahedral angles is small (Table 3).

The Sn-C1 and Sn-C bond lengths are similar to 
those in other octahedral dichlorodiphenyltin(IV) com- 
pounds [2,9] and in octahedral dichlorodiorganotin(IV) 
complexes in general [1]. The Sn-N bonds (average 
2.369(8) .~) are close in length to those in other 
SnR2X2L 2 systems with N-coordinated L [1], but 
slightly longer than the average value (2.328 ,~) in 
[SnPhEClE(HPz) 2 ] [2]. 
The phenyl rings are practically coplanar, forming 
dihedral angles of 35.7 ° (ring 1) and 38.8 ° (ring 2) with 
the CI(1)C(ll)CI(2)C(21) plane. The thiazole rings are 
essentially planar, with negligible deviation from the 
best least-squares plane, and do not undergo significant 
structural modifications on coordination [10]. The dihe- 
dral angles of these rings with the CI(1)N(11)C1(2)N(21) 
plane (14.2 ° (ring 1) and 16.1 ° (ring 2)) show that the

SnCl2(Tz) 2 moiety is closer to planar than trans- 
[PtC12(Tz) 2 ] [11 ], probably owing to the steric influence 
of the phenyl ring in the tin compound. 
Comparison of this structure with that of 
[SnPh2C12(HPz) 2] shows opposite rings to be more 
coplanar in [SnPh2C12(Tz)2]. This suggests that in- 
tramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonds have 
significant structural influence when present in this type 
of complex. 
3.2. Mi~ssbauer spectra 
Table 4 shows the MSssbauer parameters of the 
adducts. The variation of the isomer shift is typical of 
organometallic tin(IV) derivatives, the 6 values increas- 
ing on going from the phenyl complexes (average value 
1.50 mm s -1) to the methyl complexes (average value 
1.56 mm s -1 ) and finally to the ethyl compounds (aver- age value 1.74 mm s- 1 ). Moreover, the bromide adducts 
have values ca. 0.06 mm s-~ higher than the chlorides, 
as expected on electronegativity grounds. 
The AEQ values are typical of trans octahedral com- 
plexes and, as expected, those of the alkyl derivatives 
are higher than those of the aryl derivatives. Moreover, 
the AEQ of the two aryl species are almost identical, as 
are most of those of the alkyl species, suggesting that 
all these compounds have the same structure. To check 
this conclusion, the bond angles obtained by X-ray 
analysis of [SnPhEC1E(TZ)2] were used with the corre- 
sponding experimental value of AEQ to calculate the 
p.q.s, value for the N-bonded thiazole molecule accord- 
ing to the point charge model. The value obtained, 
-0.20 mm s-1 was then used for the alkyl derivatives 
to calculate a AEQ of 3.78 mm s-I, in good agreement 
with the experimental value (average 3.85 mm s-l). 
This supports the view that all these adducts have very 
similar structure.

3.3. Vibrational spectra 
The shifts in the thiazole bands [12] on coordination 
are similar to those found for other complexes with 
N-bonded ligands [13]. Significant IR bands for the 
SnR2X 2 fragment (600-100 cm -1 ) are listed in Table 
5. Their positions and intensities (the high intensity of 
the band identified as Vsym(Sn-C) for the phenyl deriva- 
tives is probably due to a contribution from a ligand 
vibration) are similar to those found for other systems 
for which all-trans octahedral SnR2X2L 2 stereochem- istry has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies [ 1, 
2, 9 and references therein, 14]. 
3.4. Characteristics in solution 
The molar conductivities of 10 -3 M solutions of the 
complexes in MeCN show them all to be non-ionogenic 
in this solvent [15].

suggest that the donor-acceptor interaction between 
SnR2X 2 and thiazole partially persists in solution. 
However the 2J(Sn-H) values for the methyl deriva- 
tives are only slightly greater than those of the free 
acceptors in this solvent (66.82/69.82 for SnMe2C12 
and 65.70/68.92 for SnMe2Br 2 [16]), suggesting that 
extensive dissociation of the thiazole ligand occurs. For 
[SnMe2X2(HPz) 2] we found [la] that the dissociative 
process [SnMe2X2(HPz)2] ~ [SnMe2X2(HPz)] + HPz 
led to the pentacoordinated [SnMe2X2(HPz) ] species 
predominating in solution; the lower 2j(Sn-H) values 
obtained for the Tz compounds suggest [17] that both 
[SnMe 2 X2(Tz) 2 ] and [SnMe 2 X2(Tz)] undergo dissocia- 
tion increasing the concentration of free SnMe2X 2 in 
solution. This conclusion is further supported by the 
values of the lj(ll9Sn-13C) coupling constants [18]. 
Similar behaviour is exhibited by the ethyl deriva- 
tives. The J(Sn-H) coupling constants are again only 
slightly greater than those for the free acceptors [16], 
suggesting that dissociation is more extensive than for 
the analogous pyrazole complexes [lb], and this is again 
confirmed by the values of the lJ(119Sn-13C) coupling 
constants [19]. 
The l H NMR spectra of the phenyl derivatives show 
two multiplets attributable to the H(2, 6) and H(3, 4, 5) 
protons. Comparison of the positions of these signals 
for [SnPh2C12(Tz) 2] and SnPh2CI 2 [20] shows only 
very slight shielding of H(2, 6) on coordination, less 
than in the analogous complex with the N-donor ligand 
bipyrimidine [20]. As in other dichlorodiphenyltin(IV) 
complexes [9,20,21], the resonance of the ipso carbon of 
the phenyl groups shifts towards higher frequencies on 
coordination, but the small magnitude of the shift (1.2 
ppm) is again suggestive [21] of extensive dissociation. 
In conclusion, in chloroform solution the dialkyl- and 
diaryltin(IV) complexes of thiazole prepared in this 
work lose the six-coordination observed in the solid 
state, an,~ the pentacoordinated species [SnR2X2(Tz)] 
that are imtially formed also undergo extensive dissocia- 
tion, even though the presence of only one set of signals 
for the Tz ligand in both lH and ~3C NMR spectra 
shows that the free and coordinated ligand are involved 
in fast interchange.
