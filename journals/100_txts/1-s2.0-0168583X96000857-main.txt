Abstract 
Samples consisting in polycrystalline films of 8 wt.% Y,O,--ZIG,, 0.8 mm thick, deposited by plasma spray technique, 
were irradiated with l-4 keV Ar ions in the fluence range between 1 X 1016 and 7 X lOi ions/cm2. The formation of 
radiation-induced Z&II> and Z&I) as well as Y(E) suboxides is demonstrated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS). In particular, reduced species start to be observed when the energy of the irradiating ions is higher than 1 keV, while 
the relative amount of the low valence cations produced for a given fluence in the altered layer has been found to depend on 
the primary ion energy. The results obtained by angular dependent XPS (ADXPS) analysis suggest that the in-depth 
distribution of the Zr and Y reduced species also depends on the primary ion energy. In particular, for samples irradiated 
with 2 keV Ar ions the Zr (and Y) reduced species are detected at the surface, while for samples irradiated with 4 keV ions 
the reduced species are found to be mostly localized in depth. The observed irradiation effects are explained in terms of 
bombardment-induced Gibbsian segregation (BIS) mechanism. 
1. Introduction 
A continuously growing interest is being devoted to 
study the effects of ion beam irradiation on refractory 
oxides and ceramic-based materials f1,2]. More in particu- 
lar, it has been demonstrated that some of the relevant 
properties of ceramics can be modified by ion irradiation. 
In fact, hardness, resistance to cracks, strengthening, fric- 
tion and wear properties are significantly affected by the 
ion beam treatments [2]. Accordingly, ion irradiation ef- 
fects in zirconia are very interesting due to both fundamen- 
tal and technological reasons. 
As to the fundamental interest, the understanding of ion 
irradiation effects on refractory oxides in general and in 
zirconia in particular is linked to the occurrence of the 
complex phenomenology of sputtering in such materials 
[1,3,4]. In particular, the still puzzling point concerns 
mainly the occurrence of more or less severe composi- 
tional modifications induced by irradiation in such materi- 
als. Likewise, the preferential depletion of oxygen in zirco- 
nia is one of the controversial points in the field, as it does 
not fit with model based on simple thermodynamical argu- 
ments [1,4]. 
On the other hand, from a technological point of view, 
among the ceramics, zirconia-based materials have an 
outstanding interest, due to their very interesting engineer-

resistant and refractory, it is currently used as a coating in 
a variety of applications such as cutting tools, pumps 
engine parts, oxygen sensors, thermal barrier coatings and, 
potentially, for biological implants. Many of these applica- 
tions require high strength with low friction and wear, 
which can be optimized by means of ion irradiation. In 
particular, it has been found that the hardness and the 
friction coefficient (i.e., the wear resistance) are affected 
by the ion-induced damage [5]. 
Finally, the preparation techniques of thin and thick 
films of zirconia and zirconia-based materials are mainly 
based on processes as air pressure plasma spray (APPS) or 
low pressure plasma spray (LPPS), electron beam deposi- 
tion or ion beam sputter deposition. All these techniques 
involve the interaction of energetic particles with the sur- 
faces of the growing films. Accordingly, some evidences 
of the chemical and structural modification of the zirconia 
surfaces induced by irradiation effects during the deposi- 
tion have been reported [6-91. 
In a general way, the mechanism of beam-induced 
modification of the properties of ceramics may involve 
several different leading factors, including compositional 
changes, due either to reactive ion implantation or to inert 
beam-induced chemistry, phase changes, including also 
amorphization, and formation of single or clustering point 
defects [4]. However, it should be noted that, due to the 
ihtrinsic difficulty in detecting them, only a little attention 
has been paid to investigate the beam-induced chemical 
modifications.

The aim of this paper is to study the occurrence of the 
compositional and chemical modifications induced in yt- 
tria-zirconia thick films by low-energy ion irradiation. The 
underlying idea is that significant chemical modifications 
of the oxidation state of the Zr and Y cations are induced 
by the ion irradiation and that the compositional modifica- 
tions, i.e., the oxygen depletion, is a direct consequence of 
such a primary chemical modification. The relevant chemi- 
cal modifications essentially consist in the reduction of the 
Z&V> and Y(II1) species respectively to Zr(III), Z&I) and 
Y(B) species. 
2. Experimental 
The yttria-zirconia samples have the following chemi- 
cal composition (wt.%): Y,O,, 7.98; ZIG,, 90.34; the 
samples contain also small traces of HfO, (1.09%>, CaO 
(0.2%), Fe,O, (0.12%) and TiO, (0.17%). The samples 
were films (about 0.8 mm thick) deposited on type AISI 
316 stainless steel, by air pressure plasma spray (APPS). 
Flat surfaces especially suited for angular dependent XPS 
analysis and for Ar + irradiation were obtained first by 
mechanical polishing to mirror-like finish, using diamond 
pastes up to 0.25 pm, followed by a cleaning step with 
organic solvents in an ultrasonic bath and air thermal 
treatment at 1220 K for 4 h. The final surface composition 
was the expected fully oxidized 8 wt.% Y,O,-ZrG,. 
Angular dependent X-ray photoelectron spectra (AD- 
XPS) were obtained in an XPS spectrometer equipped with 
hemispherical analyser using Al Ka ,J radiation (hv = 
1486.6 eV>. The electron analyser was operated in fixed 
analyser transmission mode (FAT) with a constant pass 
energy of 20 eV. Under this condition the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the reference Ag3d,,, peak for 
Ar+ cleaned material was 1.0 eV. The base pressure 
during the experiments was 5 X 10-i’ mbar in the analy- 
sis chamber. The correction for the charging-up effects 
was obtained by referencing all the peaks to the binding 
energy (B.E.) of the Au4f,,,, set at 83.8 eV, from evapo- 
rated gold onto the surface of some samples. In such 
conditions the B.E. of the Zr3d,,, is found at 182.3 eV, in 
good agreement with literature [7,10,11]. The doublet Zr 3d 
signal was analysed by a peak fitting routine, obtaining 
that the doublet consists of two Gaussian shaped peaks 
having a FWHM of 1.5 eV and a spin-orbit splitting value 
of 2.37 eV. The intensity ratio for the two peaks is 1.47 
with respect to the theoretical 1.5. 
The analysis of the various components in the Zr3d 
region of Ar+ irradiated samples has been performed by 
using doublets reproducing exactly the Z&V) doublet, i.e., 
keeping a Gaussian shape for the components, the internal 
distance between 3d,,, and 3d,,, peaks to be 2.4 eV and 
their intensity ratio 1(3d,,,): 1(3d,,,) = 1.5. The FWHM 
of each component was allowed to vary only at 0.1 eV 
after the irradiation. The Ar+ irradiation was performed in situ in the XPS 
apparatus by using a AG21 ion gun, operated at a pressure 
of 5 X lop6 mbar. Ar+ energies were set to 1, 2 and 4 
keV. Samples were irradiated in the fluence range between 
5 X 1016 and 1.2 X 10” ions/cm*. The fluence was eval- 
uated by switching the Ar+ beam onto a Faraday cup near 
to the surface of the target. The angle of incidence was 0” 
from the normal to the sample surface. 
3. Results and discussion 
Samples of the 8 wt.% (equivalent to a 4.5 mol%) 
yttria-zirconia plasma sprayed coatings (henceforth YSZ) 
have been irradiated by using Ar+ beams at 1, 2 and 4 
keV. The ion fluence ranges from 5 X 1016 to 1.0 X lOi* 
ions/cm2. The related mean projected ranges (R,) for the 
bombarding ions, as estimated by TRIM code [ 121, are 
respectively about 1.9 run for 1 keV Ar ions, 3.0 nm for 
2.0 keV ions and 4.8 nm for 4 keV ions. It should be noted 
that the thickness of the whole irradiated layer is probably 
higher than the R,, as it depends also upon the longitudi- 
nal straggling of the primary ion as well as on the effect of 
the recoiling atoms. On the other hand, we should also 
take into account the fact that probably a substantial 
alteration cannot occur below a critical energy density, as 
it is suggested from the fact that 1 keV Ar+ is not able to 
induce any detectable reduction in the fluence range up to 
1 X 10” ions/cm2. Hence, we can estimate that the thick- 
ness of the altered layer is probably comparable to the 
estimated R,. 
After each step of Ar+ irradiation, XPS measurements 
have been carried out at various values of (Y, this being the 
angle between the normal to the sample and the entrance 
slit axis. In particular (Y = 0” and cr = 60” of take-off 
angles have been explored, i.e., respectively bulk-like and 
surface-enhanced modes, as for (Y = 0” take-off angle the 
estimated sampling depth is about 6.6 nm, while for 
cr = 60” take-off angle it is 3.3 nm [13]. According to the 
above discussion, we can estimate that the XPS sampling 
depth in bulk mode is larger or comparable to the thick- 
ness of the altered layer for the considered Arf energies. 
Fig. 1A reports the XPS spectra of the energy region of 
Zr3d s/2-Zr3d,,, of a virgin YSZ sample (trace a) and an 
Ar+ irradiated surface (2 keV, fluence 1.3 X 10” 
ions/cm2) (trace b). Both spectra have been obtained with 
a take-off angle (Y = 0” (sampling depth 6.6 nm). The 
characteristic features of the 3d peaks, i.e., the binding 
energy (B.E.) of Zr3d,,, at 182.3 eV, the intensity ratio 
of 3 : 2 and the spin-orbit splitting of 2.4 eV, are in close 
agreement with those of Z&V) species [lo,1 11. The sub- 
traction of the normalized b) spectrum from the a) yields a 
further doublet structure for the irradiated samples.

shows again the doublet structure, indicated now as trace 
d, already seen in Fig. 1A. This doublet has a B.E. 1 eV 
lower than that of Zr(IV) doublet, while the spin-orbit 
splitting and the characteristic 3d,,, to 3d,,, intensity 
ratio turns to be exactly those expected for the Zr doublet. 
This is put in evidence in the peak fitting of such a doublet 
reported in Fig. 1C. We assign this doublet to Z&II> 
species (18 1.3 eV for Zr 3d,,, component). 
It is important to note that the subtraction procedure of 
the bulk-like spectrum from the surface-enhanced spec- 
trum yields the same effect as when the spectra for the 
virgin surface is subtracted from that of the irradiakd 
surface (in Fig. IA). Thus, we can see that the main effect 
of 2 keV Arc to 1.3 X lOI ions/cm2 consists in the formation of reduced Zr doublet and that the reduced 
species are mainly formed on the surface. 
The first evidence obtained by the peak fitting proce- 
dure has to be confirmed with a more definitive evidence. 
In particular, such an evidence can be univocally obtained 
by monitoring the irradiation-induced modification of the 
valence band structure. Fig. 2 reports the uppermost part of 
the valence bands of the virgin sample (Fig. 2a) and of the 
2 keV Arf irradiated one (Fig. 2b). In the case of pure 
ZrO, as well as in Yttria-doped ZrO,, theoretical calcula- 
tions showed that these levels correspond to the bonding 
levels formed essentially “02~” bands with a very weak 
d character, as expected for a Zr and Y 4d(O) configuration 
[15]. In particular, the doublet in Fig. 2a consists essen- 
tially of a component due to the 0 2pa molecular orbit&, 
centred at 7.8 eV in the present spectra and a component 
due to the 02prr, roughly centred at 5.5 eV [10,14,15]. It 
is to note that the absolute value of the bonding levels is 
still a matter of debate, as various experimental factors, 
such as the physical structure of the oxide layer, its 
thickness and crystalline structure, etc., affect the correct 
determination of the B.E. of the bonding levels with 
respect to the Fermi level. Accordingly here we positioned 
the spectra with respect to the apparent B.E., after remov- 
ing the work function of the spectrometer. 
After the Ar+ irradiation the whole shape of the va- 
lence band is significantly modified. In particular, the most 
interesting feature corresponds to a new broad band which 
appears in the bandgap, its centroid being at about 0 eV. 
This new band is due to the filling-up of 4d orbitals in the 
altered layer [ 141, i.e., to the formation of reduced Zr(III) 
or Zr(I1) species, in agreement with the spectral evidence

reported for the core Zr3d peaks in Fig. 1. We recall here 
that the possible contribution of the Y species to the V.B. 
structure is negligible, due to the very low concentration of 
the Y, the Y/Zr atomic ratio being 0.085-0.091, as 
expected for the 8 wt.% doping. 
These results indicate clearly that a reduction process is 
induced by ion irradiation in YSZ samples. Such a reduc- 
tion effect of ZrO,-based materials has been observed also 
from other research groups, either induced by electron- 
1161 or ion-irradiation [3,14,17-201. As to the general 
interpretation of the 0 loss from ZrO,, a very stable oxide, 
it has been attributed to a “chemically-guided” mecha- 
nism just based onto the formation of a met&able phase

i of Zr,O,, demanding only about 0.95 eV/atom instead of 
the 3.8 eV/atom needed to obtain the complete (and 
unlike) reduction to metallic cations [3,4]. 
The open problem for these materials consists in the 
extent and dependence of reduction upon the ion energy 
and fluence. Indeed, some authors claimed that in ZrO, 
thin films a very extensive reduction occurs, producing not 
only a predominant Zr(I1) species but also metallic Zr 
species [14,19]. On the other hand, several authors, work- 
ing on ZrO, powder compacts or thick layers, observed 
only a very mild reduction, producing mainly Zr(II1) 
species and a final substoichiometric layer of Zr0,,so_s5

a controversial point we performed a series of experiments 
to determine the evolution of the reduced phase for such 
thick film as YSZ. 
Fig. 3 reports the irradiation effects in the Zr3d region 
induced by ions of different energy and to different flu- 
ence. The samples have been analysed in the bulk-like and 
surface-enhanced modes, in order to provide some insight 
on the nature of the phenomenon. Thus, spectra reported in 
Figs. 3a, 3b, 3d and 3f are obtained with take-off angle 
(Y = O”, i.e., with a sampling depth of 6.6 nm. Spectra 3c, 
3e and 3g have been obtained with a take-off angle 
(Y = 60”, i.e., with a sampling depth of 3.3 nm [13]. 
The comparison of spectra 3b and 3c (bulk-like) with 
spectra 3d and 3e (surface enhanced) suggests that an 
energy threshold may exist for reduction, as far as the 1 
keV Ar+ irradiation does not induce any measurable re- 
duction (Figs. 3b-3c). Further experiments in our Labora- 
tory (not reported here) have shown that 1 keV Ar ions 
seem not able to promote reduction up to a fluence of 
1 X 10” ions/cm*. Thus energy and fluence thresholds, at 
least for Ar ions could well exist, energies higher than 1 
keV and fluence higher than 1 X 10” ions/cm* needed to 
promote the cation reduction. 
On the other hand, the comparison of spectra 3d-3e 
and 3f-3g suggests that ions of increasing energy have an increasing effectiveness in promoting reduction of Zr. In 
fact, these spectra refer to samples irradiated respectively 
with 2 and 4 keV Ar+ but to the same total fluence 
(1.3 X 10” ions/cm*). According to the figure, 2 keV 
Arf irradiation promotes only a very low but detectable 
reduction of Zr(IV) to Zr(III), the reduced species resulting 
“segregated” at the surface. Thus, the indicated fluence of 
about 1 X 10” ions/cm2 seems to be the onset fluence of 
Zr reduction (Fig. 3d). At variance of this, 4 keV Art 
irradiation induces a more significant reduction of Z&V) 
to Z&II) and (to a small extent) Z&I) species, the reduced 
species being more abundant in depth, i.e., “buried” 
within the altered layer. 
Fig. 4 reports the effects of Ar+ irradiation on the 
oxidation state of Y atoms present in the structure of our 
samples. The general trend with respect to the ion fluence 
is very close to that obtained for Zr atoms, as the Y(II1) 
species are reduced in part to Y(II) species as much as the 
ArC fluence and energy increase. Accordingly, also in this 
case the irradiation with 2 keV is less effective than the 
irradiation with 4 keV Ar’ ions. Furthermore, the profile 
of the Y reduced species tend to follow that of the reduced 
Zr ones, the Y(I1) being in depth for 4 keV Ar irradiated 
samples.

tive content of Zr- and the Y-related oxygen content of the 
virgin and Ar+ irradiated samples. The calculation has 
been performed by taking into account the percentage of 
the reduced Zr(II1) and,ZrfII) as well as the Y(I1) species 
normalised respectively to the initial 100% of Z&V) for 
which x = 2.0 and Y(II1) for which x = 1.5. Fig. 5 con- 
tains an interesting feature indicating the starting of the 
reversal of the profile of the reduced Zr and Y species. In 
fact, the comparison of the bulk-like (“b” traces in the 
figure) and surface-enhanced dam (“s” traces in the fig- 
ure) for 2 keV irradiated samples indicate that the reduced 
species lies on the top of the altered layer, while the same 
comparison for the 4 keV irradiated samples indicate that 
the reduced species are more in depth for such higher 
energy. 
The results shown in Figs. 3-5 deserve a more careful 
discussion. In particular, two facts seem to be well de- 
fined: a) the higher is the ion energy, the more extended is 
the reduction; b) for 4 keV Ar irradiation the reduced Zr 
and Y species is located beneath the surface. These two 
effects have to be analysed separately. 
As to the first effect, a simple explanation can be 
related to the mean projected range of projectiles of in- 
creasing energy. Accordingly, the difference in the ion 
range is responsible for the variation in the thickness of the 
effectively altered layer, and in turn, the thicker is the 
altered layer, the higher is the detected concentration of the 
reduced species. Another explanation can involve the dif- 
ference in the total deposited energy for ions of increasing 
energy. Thus, the irradiation to a given fluence with 1, 2 
and 4 keV Ar ions will involve an increasing amount of deposited energy (roughly a factor 1.5 between 1 and 4 
keV) and in turn an increasing efficiency of the reduction 
process. It is to point out that an univoque explanation of 
the reduction efficiency still needs the clarification of the 
relation between the reduction mechanism and the primary 
energy deposition events. 
As to the second effect, it deserves a more careful 
discussion, as the two chemically guided mechanisms (i.e., 
chemically random and the enthalpy guided ones) cur- 
rently proposed to account for the 0 loss from irradiated 
oxides does not allow any definite expectation about the 
depth distribution of the 0 vacancies [4]. In the same way, 
we can rule out the possible influence of a merely ballistic 
mechanism, as we expect in this case that the O-depleted 
layer lies on the top surface, due to the inhinsic nature of 
the ballistic mechanism [20]. 
Hence, we propose that the peculiar behaviour of Zr 
reduced species is due to another chemically-guided mech- 
anism, i.e., the bombardment-induced Gibbsian segrega- 
tion (BIS) [4,21]. According to such mechanism, the loss 
of 0 is induced all along the projected range of the 
incoming ions, but there is a preferential sense of diffusion 
of the available 0 atoms, due to the energetically favoured 
formation of a surface spike of 0, acting as a “pump” for 
the subsurface atoms. Thus, the process would consists in 
a “back streaming” and trapping of the in-depth depleted 
oxygen within a surfacial layer. In this framework, we can 
account for the observed difference between the 2 and the 
4 keV Arf effect, as it is due to the fact that (below a 
critical distance of the damage peak from the surface) the 
oxygen segregation layer cannot be detected by the XI’S, 
its thickness being critically related to an effective “0 
escape depth”, obviously depending on the chemical na- 
ture of the oxide. 
Accordingly, the above reported experiments suggest 
that such an “0 escape depth” is about 3 nm in YSZ, as it 
coincides with the projected range for 2 keV Ar+ ions. It 
is to recall that the XI’S technique in surface-enhanced 
mode has just a sampling depth of 3.3 nm, so that the 
existence of a possible surface O-rich layer remain unde- 
tectable. At variance of this, a clear difference will be seen 
when the Ar ion projected range is 4.8 nm, so that the 
reduced species can be detected in the bulk-like mode 
(sampling depth of 6.6 mn) but not in the surface-enhanced 
mode. 
4. Conclusions 
Let us summarize the experimental data up to now 
reported: 
a) the Ar+ irradiation promotes reduction of the Zr(IV) 
and Y(II1) cations respectively to Zr(III), Zr(II) and to 
Y(I1) species, producing respectively an average ZrO,,,, 
and a Y,O,,e phase; 
446 G.M. Zngo, G. Marletta/Nucl. Znstr. and Meth. in Phys. Rex B 116 (1996) 440446 
b> the formation rate of these reduced species increases 
with the energy of the primary ion; 
c) the reduced Z&II) and Y(U) species have a depth 
profile peaked at the surface for 2 keV Ar ions and peaked 
inside the altered layer for 4 keV Ar ions; 
d) the experimental evidence can be explained in the 
framework of the bombardment-induced Gibbsian segrega- 
tion model, accounting for the different depth profiles of 
reduced species in terms of the formation of a surface 
spike of 0, detectable in the case of the highest range but 
not detectable for an ion range comparable with the sam- 
pling depth in surface-enhanced mode. 
The results reported in the present paper can be consid- 
ered as a first stimulus to further investigation of the 
microstructure of the altered layers as a tool to understand 
the working mechanisms for the compositional modifica- 
tion of oxides systems.
