Abstract 
Seven chiral macrocyclic ligands with potential O2P~ and NzP 2 coordination sites owing their chirality from the incorporation of an 
axial-chiral binaphthyl unit were used as chiml auxiliaries in transition metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Three 
model reactions were investigated, and enantioselectivities are discussed on the basis of accepted mechanistic pathways by using X-ray 
structural analyses.

I. Introduction 
During the past decade progressively extensive stud- 
ies have fi)cused on the formation of asymmetric quater- 
nt~ry carbon centers under the catalysis of chiral trm~si- 
lion metal complexes. A large number of reports h~s 
been published, and these are summarized in review 
articles and books [I,2]. tlighlights have been palladium 
and nickel catalyzed cross°coupling reactions with fer- 
rocene ligands affording 3-pbenyl-l-butene and biaryls 
witli up to 94 and 95% e.e. i~spectively [3,4]. Also 
palladium catalyzed ailylic substitution reactions have 
been realized very suecessfitlly using P-P, P-N and 
N-N ligands [5]. 
These results encouraged us to investigate the de- 
pendence of the asymmetric induction on the distance 
between the asymmetric moiety and the transition metal 
center. Simple model compounds like 2A-6A [6a,b] or 
10A and I IA were therefore tested in typical catalytic 
reactions. A local C s symmetry of the diphosphine 
sub-unit with cis P-phenyl groups constitutes an achiral 
array near the transition metal. A chiral "disturbance" 
is introduced by a C2-symmetricai binaphthyl unit which 
is held at varying distance from the transition metal 
center by means of two polymethylene ("spacer")

Pll S0022-328X(96)0625 I- I chains, thus introducing different degrees of chiral inter- 
action. It is obvious that a direct rehttionship between 
asymmetric induction and the distance between the 
chir~li center and transition met;tl is based on a roug, h 
simplification, because the existence of a preferred con° 
formation of the spacer determines the ~tctual dist~mce. 
Therefore the expected con'elation will only be ob- 
served if high conlbrmative flexibility of the polymethy. 
lene chain and unrestricted access of reactants to the 
complexation sites exist. 
in addition to dioxa-diphospha ligands, diaza=di- 
phospha ligands were also investigated since the intro- 
d, ,n of nitrogen donor atoms might improve the 
efl .... ncy of the catalysts; one of the nitrogen atoms 
may offer an additional complexation site during the 
catalytic cycle, thus lowering the risk of side reactions 
of coordinatively unsaturated species and forcing the 
metal into the center of the macrocycle. Moreover, the 
N-CH 3 groups could interact with the incoming sub- 
strate resulting in a preorganisation before any associa- 
tion step or oxidative addition were to take place.

From one iigand (2A) and two of the complexes 
(2A, PdCI, and II. NiCI,) the crystal structures could be determined. Characteristic structural features are 
listed in Table I. 
The biaryl angles range from ! 12.13 ° for 2A to 
76.22 ° for IIA. NiCl:. As observed previously, these 
pronounced changes occur easily in l,l'-binaphthyl se- 
ries and are caused by the flat energy minimum between 
the cisoid and transoid conformation at approximately 
65 and i 15 ° respectively [6b,c,d]. The ease of conforma- 
tional changes during coordination to nickel(ll) or palla- 
dium(II) and an "'out of center" torsion of the P, MCI 2 
(M = Ni, Pd) fragment, which resulted in a nearly 
perpendicular arrangement of the macrocycle and the 
complex unit, seem to compensate for the presumptive 
steric strain, thus stabilizing these complexes. The only 
evidence for steric strain was found in deviations of 
carbons 14-1 !-61-64 fix)m linearity by 1.0/5.4 ° (2A) 
to 6.91/3.16 ° (2A. PdCl:). Both complexes show a 
slightly distorted square-planar array with typical angles 
and distances and no nitrogen coordination in llA.

conducted following a standard procedure [8a] with 
slight modifications. The product was isolated in mod- 
erate to good yield but asymmetric inductions were 
found to be low. Also, for reaction (2) the enantioselec- 
tivities were low and no dependence of the asymmetric 
induction fi'om the length of the spacer was observed.

yielding 75% of (S)-13 with 23% e.e. The ailylic substi-

to 17% is observed within the group of homologues. In 
contrast to these ligands, 10A and IIA with N-CHa 
instead of O showed the opposite behavior; IIA (77% 
e.e.) exhibits a significantly higher efficiency than 10A 
(52% e.e.). We speculated that this reversal could be 
due to the presence of more than one catalytically active 
palladium complex of 10A. 
Since reaction (3) seemed to be sufficiently sensitive 
to structural variations, additional experiments were 
made to extend the scope and limitations of the new 
auxiliaries (Table 3). If N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide 
(BSA) was substituted by Nail, enantiomeric excesses 
are somewhat lower but a similar trend is observed. In 
these experiments isolated PdCI 2 complexes of 2A-6A 
[6a,b] were used, which were found to give better 
reproducible results. W,~ also noticed an effect previ- 
ously reported by Allen et al. [11], that the concentra- 
tion of reactants influenced the rate of the reaction 
significantly while the e.e. remained unaffected; with 
BSA in 1 ml of CH.,CI, the conversion was completed within 1 h but the same reaction in 4 ml of CH2C! 2 
took about 18 h to go to completion (entries 9, 15). In 
addition to [Pd(C3Hs)CI] 2, Pd2(dba) 4 [12] (dba= 
C6Hs-CH=CH-CO-CII:: CILC6H 5) and Pd(OAc)~ 
were also tested as sources for palladium. Pd:(dba) 4 
showed slightly higher e.e. with good chemical reactiv- 
ity, but Pd(OAc) 2 proved to be largely unreactive (en- 
tries 1, 16, 17). Lowering the reaction temperature 
decreased the reaction rate dramatically, but the asym- 
metric induction was only slightly improved (entries 9, 
18). Finally, the ligand/Pd ratio was varied (entries 19 
(0.5: 1), 8 (1: 1), 20 (2:1)). The results pointed to a 
1 : I complex as the catalytically active species with an 
equilibrium constant above 1. These results encouraged 
us to extend our investigations to allylic substrates 
without phenyi groups, like (E)-pent-3-ene-2-yl acetate 
(14) and 3-acetoxy-cyclohex-l-ene, both substrates for 
which reports of high asymmetric induction are rare 
[13]. Using our most efficient ligand, 2A, 14 was ob- 
tained in good chemical yield (85%), but the e.e. was

low (21%5. This result could not be improved signifi- 
cantly either by lowering the temperature (entries 21-23) 
or by varying the solvent (entries 21, 24. 25). A slightly 
higher asymmetric induction could be achieved with 
IIA (33% e.e.), while 10A failed to give any enantiose- 
iectivity (entries 26, 27). The reaction with the cyclic 
substrate 3-aeetoxy-cyclohex- l-ene proceeded smoothly 
with good chemical yield, but with almost no enantiose- 
lectivity (not included in Table 2). 
Despite the limited number of experiments the strik- 
ing differences in the enantioselection exhibited in three 
C-C coupling reactions is worth consideration. We 
think that this behavior can be rationalized on the basis 
of different mechanistic suggestions for (15-(3), as re- 
ported in the literature [8-10]. 
Model reactions (I) and (25, where chiral Grignard 
reagents are involved, generally differ from (3). in 
reactions (!) and (2) the configuration determining step 
is the enantioselective formation of an alkyl metal inter- 
mediate with both carbon fragments o'-bouud to the 
metal center. This is followed by reductive elimination 
of the product with retention of the configuration. On 
the contrary, in reaction (3) the nueleophile attacks the 
terminal carbon atom of a w-allyl complex from "out- 
side". 
Since in (!) and (2) the enantiodetermining step is 
the selective reaction of one enantiomeric ibrm of the 
Grignard reagent, this reaction is usually considered as 
a kinetic optical resolution [Sa]. In bo,h cases a 
diorg, anometal comple~ in which the asymmetric cente" 
i~ already fixed precedes the reductive elimination of 
the product. For t~action (I), proceeding tinder the 
¢aialysis of fetTocenyloN=P ligands, a mechanism was 
proposed which postulates a weak N=Mg interaction to 
account for high enantioselectivity [Sa]; in contra~t, an 
epimerisation of the chiral carbon center via I~=hydride 
dimination has also been discussed [8a, 14]. If no approo 
priate donor atom in the ligand structure is available, 
only transient steric interactions of the Grignard reagent 
with the chiral carbon back-bone may operate to induce 
some enantiodifferentiation, Tentatively, we assume that 
this stercoselective association step is responsible lbr 
the e e, rather than a diffet~ence in t~activity of the 
diastereomeric diorganometal intermediates, Sugges. 
tions for a mechanism of (2) are spa~e, but ~*allyl 
intermediates are most likely to be involved [9b], Never- 
theless, it seems to be a common feature of both cases 
that only a trajectory which is chirally modelled in an 
ideal manner will direct selectively one enantiomeric 
nucleophile to the reaction center, 
For coupling (3), Ibr which a different mechanism 
was suggested [10], the situation is much mote promis- 
ing, Since a non~chirai nucleophile attacks the symmet= 
rical allyl intermediate from "'outside", i,e, opposite the 
transition metal without preceding coordination at the 
metal center, the enantioselectivity of the ovet~di reac- tion is governed by two features: (a) the preferred 
geometry of the allyl complex (Fig. 3(a) I and II) and 
(b) the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic attack. 
From molecular modelling calculations we gained 
some evidence for a positive interaction between the 
1,3-diphenyl-allyl moiety and the P-phenyl rings, which 
may be responsible for a highly preferred steric arrange- 
mere of the "rr-aUyi complex [15]. This hypothesis is 
corroborated by the dramatic drop in e.e. if the corre- 
sponding dimethyl-allyl substrate is employed. Since 
the terminal carbon atoms of the allyl fragment are ca, 3 
,~ distant from each other, good regioselectivity caused 
by different steric interactions is relatively easily at- 
tained. A hypothetical structure of the prefen~ed inter- 
mediate with (S)a~,,a~-configuration is depicted in Fig. 
3(b), showing a significantly better accessibility of the 
A-labeled allylic carbon from which an (R)-config- 
urated product arises.

3.3.1. General proct, dure 
A Schlenk tube was carefully dried and charged with 
20 ml of dry THE After degassing by three freeze- 
pump-thaw cycles, 1,2-bis(phenylphosphino)benzene 
(353 rag, 333 p.I, i.2 mmol) was added and subse- 
quently "BuLl solution (1.5 ml, 2.4 mmol) was added 
dropwise over 15 min. In a second Schlenk tube a 
degassed solution of I mmol of bromoamine [7] (526 
mg of 8, 554 mg of 9) in 18 ml of THF was prepared. 
These two solutions were slowly and synchronously 
added to a well stin'ed volume of approximately 100 ml 
of degassed THF [7], avoiding excess of one of the 
reactants (I-I.5 h). After the addition was complete 
stin'ing was continued for I h and the solvent was 
evaporated. Water was added and the mixture was 
extracted with 3 x 2(1 ml of CII,CI~. The combined 
extracts were washed with waler and bl'ine and dried 
(Na;SO,~). After i~mov:d of the solvent trader vacuo the 
residue was 13urified by column chromatography as

bath was removed and the mixture was stirred at RT. 
The progress of the conversion was followed by NMR. 
The reaction was quenched by careful addition of dilute 
HCI. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous 
layer was extracted repeatedly with Et20. The organic 
extracts were shaken with NaOH solution (10%) to 
remove phenol, washed neutral and dried (Na.,SO4).

15. Column chromatography (silica gel, 10 x 2.2 cm 2, 
PE/CH2C! 2 50: 50, UV 290 nm). The isolated product 
was found to be pure by NMR. I H NMR 8:3.50 (s, 
3H), 3.69 (s, 3H), 3.94 (d, IH, J 10.8 Hz), 4.25 (dd, 
IH, J 8.4, 10.8 Hz), 6.31 (dd, IH, J 8.4, 15.8 Hz), 
6.46 (d, IH, J 15.8 Hz), 7.16-7.35 (m, 10H) ppm. E.e. 
was estimated by using a chiral shift reagent (Eu(hfc)3, 
IH NMR in CDCI~, integration of one singlet of di- 
astereotopic OCH 3 groups which shifted from 3.67 to 
ca. 4.0 ppm, A 0.06-0.08 ppm) and was confirmed by 
chiral HPLC (Chiralcel OD-H, 250 x 4.6 mm 2, 0.5 ml 
min- i 2-propanol/n-hexane (2: 98)). Specific rotation 
calculated for optically pure (S)-15: [o~1~ ° -22.4 {c--

3.5.4. Reaction (3). Procedure ilIB with Nail 
A solution of (E)- 1,3-diphenylprop-3-ene- i -yl acetate 
(252 rag, I mmol) in 4 ml of dry THF was degassed, 
the isolated palladium complex L" PdCI 2 (L" = 2A-6A, 
0.01 retool, 1 tool%) [6] was added and the solution was 
stin'ed tot" 15 min [23]. A solution of the malonate anion 
was prepared at RT by adding Nail dispersion (63 rag, 
1.5 mmol) in portions to a degassed solution of dimethyl 
malonate (198 mg, 171 I~1, 1.5 retool) in 4 ml of TltF. 
After 30 min the resulting turbid solution was added to 
the ice cooled solution containing allyl acetate and the 
catalyst and the reaction was stirred at RT. The reaction 
was quenched by adding a small amount of 2 N HC! 
and the mixture was extracted with Et,O (3 x 10 ml). 
The combined extracts were washed with brine until 
neutral and dried (Na2SO4). After removal of the sol- 
vent the crude product was purified by chromatography 
as given for Procedure iliA. 
3.6. X-ray structural analyses 
Data were collected o'n a modified STOE diffrac- 
tometer equipped with an N:-cold-stream low tempera- 
ture device (92 K) using Mo K c~ radiation. Structure 
solutions were carried out by direct methods (SHELXTL-I"C 
[24a]) followed by least-squares refinement against F 2 
with no or-cutoff being applied (SHELXL°93 [24b]). 
Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (adps) were 
assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. Positions of hydro- 
gen atoms were calculated according to stereochemical 
aspects. Atomic coordinates ate listed in Tables 4-6 
[251.

4. Conclusions 
The general usefulness of macrocyclic diphosphine 
ligands has been demonstrated for the palladium cat- 
alyzed allylic substitution provided one of the ailylic 
intermediates, stabilized by steric and/or electronic in- 
teractions, predominates. Their absence for substrates 
like (E)-pent-3-ene-2-yl acetate or cyclohex-l-ene-3-yl 
acetate seems to be responsible for poor e.e. values. An 
improvement can be expected for more rigid ligand 
structures with enlarged perimeter, eventually forcing 
the allyl complex into better proximity to the chiral 
environment. Assuming Curtin-Hammett conditions and 
the enantioselective step to be under reactant control, 
the sense and magnitude of the asymmetric induction 
will be the result of both the preference of one allylic 
intermediate and the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic 
attack.
