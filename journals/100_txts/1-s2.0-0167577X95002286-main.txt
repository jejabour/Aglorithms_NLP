Abstract 
Sic/C composite layers with various compositions were deposited on graphite substrates by chemical vapor deposition. 
The effects of the C/l:C + Sil and H,/[C + Si] ratios in the source gas on the composition, growth rate, preferred 
orientation and morphology of the deposited layers were studied. It was revealed that the C/[C + Si] as well as H,/[C + Si] 
ratios in the input gas affected the carbon content of the deposited film. Sic/C functionally gradient materials (FGMs) were 
prepared on the basis of conditions established by the deposition of the Sic/C mixed phase. It turned out that the 
CH,-SiCl,-HZ, C,H*--SiCI,-Ar and C,Hs-SiCl,-Ar-H, systems were suitable for the deposition of Sic-rich layers, 
C-rich layers and layers in between, respectively.

1. Introduction 
Since the concept of functionally gradient materi- 
als (FGMs) was proposed in 1984 [l], numerous 
researchers [2-51 on Sic/C FGMs have been per- 
formed for applications as thermal shock resistant 
materials. Koizumi [6] reported that a 300 mm square 
shell sample of SiC/‘C FGM for the base of the 
fuselage of space planes and a 50 mm diameter 
semispherical bowl for the nose-cone was success- 
fully fabricated and tested in 1992. They turned out 
to be able to withstand both a maximum temperature 
of 2000 K and a temperature difference of 1000 K. It 
l Corresponding author. was reported that Sic/C FGMs were synthesized by 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by varying the 
Si/C ratio in the source gas [7-lo]. Despite that the 
H,/[C + Si] ratio critically affects carbon contents 
in the deposited layers, there is no report about the 
effects of the H,/[C + Si] ratio in the input gas on 
the composition df Sic/C FGMs. The previous re- 
ports were hardly applicable to commercialization 
because the deposition temperature was too high 
(above 1773 K) and total gas pressure was too low. 
Furthermore, the published data were so ambiguous 
that it was difficult to determine the optimum condi- 
tion for the deposition of Sic/C FGMs. Therefore, 
we tried to deposit Sic/C FGMs on graphite sub- 
strates at lower temperatures and higher total gas 
pressure with less pure source gases. The effects of

the C/[C + Si] and H2/[C + Si] ratios in the input 
gas on deposit layers were studied. 
2. Experimental 
Propane, methane and bubbled silicon tetra-chlo- 
ride were used as source gases. The carrier gas was 
hydrogen and the atmosphere gases were hydrogen 
and argon. Argon and nitrogen gases were used for 
purging. A hot wall type CVD reactor was used for 
the deposition of FGMs on the graphite substrate. 
Deposition temperature was fixed at 1573 K (com- 
mercially manageable temperature) and the Sic/C 
ratio was changed by controlling the flows of the 
source and atmospheric gases in a stepwise fashion 
with mass flow controllers WFCs). The total gas 
pressure (P,) during the deposition was between 1.3 
and 6.5 kPa. 
For the deposition of Sic-rich phases, either 
propane or methane was used as the C source gas. 
The deposition rate was slightly higher when the 
propane gas was used; however, there was no differ- 
ence in chemical and physical properties of each 
deposit. For the deposition of Sic/C nanocomposite 
layers, the gas flows of propane, silicon tetra-chlo- 
ride, hydrogen and argon were carefully controlled 
stepwise by schedules. For the deposition of C-rich 
phases, only propane gas was used with the argon- 
rich atmosphere because the carbon deposition rate 
of methane gas was too low under the hydrogen 
atmosphere. 
An X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used for 
phase analysis. A scanning electron microscope 
@EM), equipped with an energy dispersive spec- 
trometer (EDS) and a wavelength dispersive spec- 
trometer (WDS), were used for the microstructural 
observations for both the deposit and fracture sur- 
faces, and for compositional microanalysis within the 
deposit layer. 
3. Results

3.1 .I. EfSect of the C/[C + Sil ratio on the deposits 
From the computer calculation of chemical species 
[l l] under the conditions of P, = 1.3 Wa and H,/[C + Si] = 100, pure silicon carbide was expected to be 
deposited within the C/[C + Si] ratio range of 0.35 
to 0.45. Out of this range, one of two mixtures, i.e. 
Sic + Si or Sic + C, was to be deposited. 
Based on the above consideration, a series of 
single layers were deposited at various C/[C + Si] 
ratios. The H.J[C + Si] ratio, the flow rate of SiCl, 
+ CH, and deposition time were fixed as 20, 100 
seem and 100 min, respectively. The morphologies 
of the surfaces and corresponding fracture surfaces 
of the coating layers for various C/[C + Si] ratios 
are shown in Fig. 1. A sharp faceted columnar 
structure [ 12,131, which is the typical morphology of 
CVD Sic, was observed at C/[C + Si] = 0.45 as 
shown in Fig. Id. The sharp facets were getting 
smoother and changed to rounded columnar grams at 
higher C/[C + Si] ratios. On the other hand, the 
columnar structure disappeared at lower C/[C + Si] 
ratios; instead, large grains with small facets were 
formed as shown in Fig. le. As illustrated in a series 
of fracture surfaces, the highest deposition rate was 
obtained at C/[C + Si] = 0.45 and further deviation 
from C/[C + Si] = 0.45 the lower the rate. 
The relationship between the C/[C + Si] ratio 
and growth rate is shown in Fig. 2. The fastest 
growth rate was obtained in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 of 
C/[C + Si] ratios, which is in accord with the stable 
region for pure Sic in the CVD phase diagram [ 111. 
The thermodynamic calculations predicted that Sic, 
as well as pyrolytic carbon, can be co-deposited in 
the region 0.5 to 1.0 of the ratio. However, no 
deposition layer was identified for the system CH,- 
H, (C/[C + Si] = 1.0, H2/[C + Si] = 20). This 
could be due to the formation of hydrocarbons, that 
is, the deposited pyrolytic carbon layer was etched 
by hydrogen at H,/[C + Si] ratios higher than 20 
and resulted in the hydrocarbons. Thus, when the 
C/[C + Si] ratio is higher than 0.5, residual carbon 
which did not participate to form Sic, could be 
etched by hydrogen and no pyrolytic carbon con- 
densed. The larger the C/[C + Si] ratio, the smaller 
the number of carbon atoms for forming condensed 
Sic, and thus, the deposition rate was reduced. 
Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns taken from the sam- 
ples coated at various C/[C + Si] ratios. For all of 
the C/[C + Si] ratios, the P-Sic peak was detected 
except for ratios of 0 and 1. The preferred orientation 
of deposited P-Sic crystallites was examined by 
Y. Kim et al./Marerials Leners 26 (19%) 249-257 2.51 
XRD. One of two peaks from { 111) and (220) planes 
of @-Sic was detected as a main peak in XRD 
analysis. Chin [ 121 reported that CVD /I-Sic films 
exhibit (220) preferred orientation at high deposition 
temperature, and (111) at low temperature. On the 
other hand, Cheng et al. [13] claimed that the higher 
deposition rate and the longer deposition time re- 
sulted in a stronger lendency to form (2201 preferred orientation. The layer was formed with preferred 
orientation of {220} at C/[C + Si] = 0.35-0.65 and 
the diffraction peak from the 1111) plane was a main 
one for the other ranges. Such a change of preferred 
orientation, depending on the C/[C + Si] ratio, could 
be related to the growth rate of the deposited Sic 
film, As shown in Fig. 2, the fastest growth rate 
occurred in the range 0.4 to 0.5 of the C/[C + Si]

Fig. 2. Variation of growth rate of the Sic/C layer at various 
C/[C + Si] ratios in the input gas, 
ratio. The higher the deposition rate, the stronger 
tendency for the growth of the (220) orientation. The 
faster growth rate could cause easier growth of (220) 
planes rather than growth of (111) planes since { 111) 
planes are the close packed planes in the sphalerite 
structure and surface energies of the (220] planes are 
higher than that of { Ill}. 
At C/[C + Si] ratios higher than 0.69, weak 
graphite peaks were detected. The graphite peak 
might come from not only the deposit layers but also 
from the graphite substrate since the thicknesses of 
the deposited layers were too thin. In contrast to the 
expectation at equilibrium, a weak Si { 111) peak was 
detected even at higher C/[C + Si] ratios [14]. 3.1.2. Eflect of the H2/IC + Sil ratio on the 
deposits 
From the thermodynamic calculations, it turned 
out that thermodynamic yields of free carbon in- 
creased rapidly with decreasing H, ratios [l 11. 
Therefore, the depositions were performed at various 
H2/[C + Si] ratios in order to increase the carbon 
contents in the deposits, while other deposition pa- 
rameters were fixed at C/[C + Si] = 0.56, deposition 
temperature = 1527 K, Pt = 1.3-6.5 kPa and deposi- 
tion time = 100 min. 
Fig. 4 shows as-deposited surfaces and fracture 
surfaces of the layers deposited at various H,/[C + 
Si] ratios. The faceted morphology was observed at 
both H&C + Si] = 15 and 10 although each grain 
boundary was not distinctive. A rough columnar 
structure was observed in the fracture surfaces for 
both H&C + Si] = 15 and 10. However, the grains 
became round at H,/[C + Si] = 5 and the boundary 
of each grain was not clear. At H&C + Si] = 1, 
surface morphology drastically changed to the peb- 
ble structure which is a typical morphology of amor- 
phous CVD Si,N,. The deposition rate was so slow 
that the thickness of the deposit layer, which looked 
like amorphous, was only 1 Frn. 
In addition, when the H&C + Si] ratio was de- 
creased, the surface morphology of deposited layers 
varied depending on the deposit position, a phe- 
nomenon that was not observed for the H&C + Si]

ratio = 20. At position 1 (position 1 was the nearest 
site to the gas inlet, while the larger position number, 
the further away the position was from the gas inlet), 
the columnar roundled grains were deposited. At 
positions 2 and 3, faceted grains were formed as in 
Fig. lc. At position 4, needle-like structure was 
appeared. These changes of deposit microstructure might be due to the depletion effect of reactant gas. 
At a low H2/[C + Si] ratio, the partial pressure of 
the reactant gas became higher, which leads to a 
higher degree of supersaturation of the reactant gas. 
Thus, the depletion effect of the reactant gas yielded 
a different layer morphology depending on the de- 
posit position.

3.2. C, H,-Ar system 
Because the deposition of a thick carbon layer 
using CH, and SiCl, was very difficult, the C,H, + 
Ar system was tried to provide sufficient amounts of 
carbon atoms. Ar instead of H, was used to improve 
the decomposition of C,H, efficiently. In this sys- 
tem the pebble structure, which was already shown 
in Fig. 4g, and the layered structure were observed 
on the surface and on the fracture surface, respec- 
tively. These morphologies were supposed to be 
typical morphologies of turbostratic pyrolytic carbon 
[151. The growth rate of the carbon layer was in- 
creased; however, the optimum growth rate for the 
deposition of the C-rich phase in FGM could not be 
obtained with this system. 
3.3. C, H,-SiCl,-Ar system 
Sic/C composite layers containing carbon of 50 
to 60 at% were deposited in the CH,-SiCl,-H2 
system by lowering the HJ[C + Si] ratio. However, 
the CsHs-SiCI,-Ar system was tried in order to 
control the carbon content for every possible combi- 
nation of Sic and C. Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs 
of Si-containing carbon deposits. The surface mor- 
phologies were similar to that of the carbon deposits 
obtained for the C,H,-Ar system and a layered 
structure appeared in the fracture surface. The depo- 
sition rate was 3 or 4 times higher than that of the 
C,H,-Ar system. This result is in good agreement 
with the results of Hirai et al. [8,15,16]. This growth 
rate was nearly comparable to that of Sic obtained in 
the CH,-SiCI,-H, system. SiCl, or SM, is gener- 
ally known to increase the deposition rate of py- 
rolytic carbon; however, the cause of this phe- 
nomenon is not yet clear. 
Pyrolytic graphite is an excellent insulator perpen- 
dicular to the basal plane. At high temperature it 
exhibits one of the lowest thermal conductivities 
amongst all solid insulators. Hirai et al. reported that 
these layered structure pyrolytic carbons exhibited 
very low thermal conductivity perpendicular to these 
layers [8]. Thus, deposits having a layered structure, 
as shown in Fig. 5, can play an important role as a 
thermal barrier in Sic/C FGM. 
From the XRD analysis, the deposited layer was 
composed of graphite and SIC. A negligible Si peak Fig. 5. SEM micrographs of Si-containing pyrolytic carbon layers

was also detected. The contents of C and Sic in the 
deposit shown in Fig. 5 were 85.7 wt% and 14.3 
wt%, respectively, by EDS quantitative analysis. 
Therefore, it turned out that this system was suitable 
for the deposition of C-rich layers in FGM from the 
growth rate and compositional points of view. 
3.4. C, H,-SiCl,-Ar-H, system 
As shown in Fig. 6, the various morphologies of 
the deposited layers depend on the C/[C + Si] and 
H2/[C + Si] ratios. A monolithic SIC layer with 
faceted structure is shown in Fig. 6a. It appeared to 
be different from the Sic layer deposited in the 
CH,-SiCl,-H, system (Fig. lc). As the C/[C + Si] 
ratio was higher and the H,/[C + Si] ratio lower, the 
morphology of the fracture surface changed from 
columnar to a layered structure, as shown in Figs. 
6b, 6d and 6f. Hence, the surface morphology 
changed from a faceted structure to a rounded struc- 
Y. Kim et al./Materials Letters 26 (1996) 249-257 255 
ture as shown in Figs. 6a, 6c and 6e. Judging from 
Fig. 6 and EDS quantitative analyses, the composi- 
tional change and growth rate for each condition 
were well controlled and good for the deposition of 
FGM layers. Therefore, it was concluded that this 
system was suitable for the deposition of layers 
whose composition was between pure Sic and C-rich 
phases. 
3.5. Deposition of SC/C FGM 
Sic/C FGMs having 3 to 6 steps were prepared, 
using methane and propane as source gases. In case 
of the CH,-SiCl,-H, system where C/[C + Si] 
ratio varies but H,/‘[C + Si] ratio is fixed (= 201, 
boundaries between each step were distinctive and a somewhat porous layer was grown in a dendritic 
manner at the second step. 
The compositional gradient within the layers de- 
posited in the CH,-SiC14-H2 system was not iden- 
tified by EPMA line scanning and mapping, despite 
the variation of the C/[C + Si] ratio in the source 
gas. It was reported that the Sic/C FGM was 
prepared by controlling only the C/[C + Si] ratio in 
the input gases [10,17-201. However, the composi- 
tional gradient of the Sic/C FGM was not realized 
by controlling the C/[C + Si] ratio in the input gas 
and fixing the H&C + Si] ratio high. This could be 
due to the etching of free carbon by hydrogen at 
higher H,/[C + Si] ratios as expected from the re- 
sults of the non-FGM produced from the CH,- 
SiCl,-H, system. Therefore, it is desirable for depo-

sition of the Sic/C FGM to simultaneously control 
both C/[C + Si] and H2/[C + Si] ratios in the input 
gas. 
Fig. 7 shows the fracture surface .of the Sic/C 
FGM deposited in the C,Hs-SiCl,-Ar-H, system. 
As seen in Fig. 7a, the layered structure of pyrolytic 
carbon is observed at layers 1 and 2, and a porous 
structure is shown at layer 3 from the substrate. 50 mm of the FGM layers and became constant 
within the monolithic Sic layer. This EDS analysis 
demonstrated clearly the composition gradient within 
the Sic/C FGM. 
4. Conclusions 
Wang et al. reported that the porous structure of 
Sic/C nanocomposites could be due to the supersat- 
uration of the reactant gas influenced by the total 
pressure and concentration of the reactant gases and 
proposed the condition at which the porous Sic/C 
nanocomposite was formed [2]. In this experiment, 
however, the porous structure appeared only in FGMs 
and never generated in the non-FGM layer. Thus, the 
state of one layer in FGM was supposed to affect the 
nucleation and growth kinetics of the next one. The 
layered structure existing at layers 1 and 2, as shown 
in Fig. 7a, which was observed in deposition of 
pyrolytic carbon, was expected to be a thermal bar- 
rier in Sic/C FGM. In the deposit with 6 steps (Fig. 
7b), a very porous layer was deposited at a third 
layer from the substrate in a dendritic pattern, where 
the dendritic structure transformed to the dense 
columnar structure. Sic/C FGMs with compositional gradients were 
prepared in the C,Hs-SiCl,-Ar-H, system by con- 
trolling both the H&C + Si] and C/[C + Si] ratios. 
In some of the FGM layers, a porous structure was 
observed, which did not appear in the non-FGM of 
same experimental condition. Therefore, it was likely 
that the state of one layer influenced the nucleation 
and growth kinetics of the next layer in the deposi- 
tion of FGMs. To deposit stepwise FGMs, it turned 
out that CH,-SiCl,-Hz, CsHs-SiCl,-Ar and 
C,H,-SiCl,-Ar-H, systems are suitable for the 
deposition of Sic-rich layers, C-rich layers, and 
layers between them, respectively.
