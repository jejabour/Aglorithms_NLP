Abstract 
This short communication summarises the effects of the dopant ion concentration on the photoluminescence efficiency of 
CaFCl : Eu*+ powder phosphors. These phosphors have displayed a fluorescent transition (4f6(‘FJ>5d -+ 4f ‘(‘S,,,)) at 395 
nm upon excitation by a UV source (280 nm). Measured XRD spectra confirm the presence of Eu2+ in all six synthesized 
powder phosphors.

Over the past four years, we have been develop- 
ing and characterising several powder phosphors 
doped with certain appropriate quantities of suitable 
fluorescing RE 3+ ions, for observing three primary 
(B,G and R) colours, upon excitation either by an 
electron beam or a UV source [I-S]. Hosoi et al. [9] 
and Meijerink et al. [lo] have reported that the 
MFX: Eu*+ (M = Ba, Sr, Ca; X = Cl, Br, I> powder 
phosphors would exhibit high efficiency fluores- 
cence. These phosphors are considered to be more 
useful in some image forming radiography. We have 
very recently undertaken the preparation and analysis 
of such important phosphors and a first paper con- 
cerning the luminescent phosphors of BaFCl:Eu*+ 
[l I] will appear soon. The present work describes the 
emission spectral results concerning the CaFCl : Eu2+ 
powder phosphors (with the EuZt dopants in six 
different concentrations). Following the experimental methods described earlier in the literature [12], the 
CaFCl : Eu*+ phosphors were prepared in a neutral 
atmosphere by reacting the pure chemicals CaF2, 
CaCl, and EuCl, for an hour at 700°C in an electric 
furnace. Ammoniumchloride was the flux used in 
synthesising these phosphors. The availability of the 
Eu2+ ions and also the synthesis confirmation of 
these phosphors were verified from the measured 
XRD spectral profiles. We had access to these 
recording facilities (fluorescence spectra and XRD 
profiles) at the CECRI, Karaikudi, India. Table 1 
gives the fractional mol% of each chemical used to 
prepare in CaFCl : Eu2+ phosphors:

CaFCl : Eu2’ phosphors describing the variations in 
the intensity as a function of the dopant Eu2+ ion 
concentration. The emission level intensity at 395 
nm was found to be increasing gradually from the 
concentration 0.01 mol% up to 0.05 mol% and after 
that, the relative intensity was found to decrease 
steadily in spite of the increase in the Eu2+ concen-

tration. This gives an opportunity to identify a better 
phosphor material composition, among the six stud- 
ied here. From the emission spectral results, the 
appropriate and suitable Eu2+ ion concentration 
could thus be fixed up for observing an efficient 
fluorescence. This emission peak has been assigned 
to the transition (4f6(‘F,>5d + 4f7(8S7,,>) of Eu*+ ion as was previously carried out for some other 
materials in the literature [l 11. On examining the 
profiles shown in Fig. 1, it is clear to state that the 
phosphors containing more and more Eu2+ concen- 
tration show weaker emission; however, for these 
cases the emission peak allows one to observe two 
well resolved components. Another interesting point 
of observation was that the spectrum concerning this 
ideal concentration reveals a high intensity, which is 
over three times larger than the one for the low 
concentration (0.025 mol%) Eu’+. Therefore, it is 
possible to suggest that CaFCl : Eu*+ (0.05 mol%) is 
a better phosphor material among the six studied for 
use as the coating material in the image forming 
system.
