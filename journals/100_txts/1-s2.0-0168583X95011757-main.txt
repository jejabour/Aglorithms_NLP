Abstract 
The structure features of YBCO (I IO&films on (110) SrTiO, substrate were studied by 3.05 MeV He’+ and 6 MeV 
Li3+ ion channeling measurement. Li3+ Ion was used to enhance the mass resolution of Ba, Y and Cu. Angular scan along 
the [I IO] directions reflected a misorientation between the film and the substrate. A sample consisting of three distinctive 
layers deposited under three different conditions were used to study the relationships between deposition conditions and 
crystallographic orientation. The angle of misorientation is consistent with a tilting in compensating for the lattice parameter 
difference between the substrate and the YBCO film. 
1. Introduction 
Cuprate high temperature superconductors are layer 
compounds of orthorhombic crystal structure. In 
YBa,Cu,O,_, (YBCO), two CuO planes, being parallel 
to the a- and b-axes and thus also called the ab-planes, 
exist in a unit cell with c-axis perpendicular to them. 
Many believe that the coupling of CuO planes carries 
important clue to the mechanism of high temperature 
superconductivity and that understanding the anisotropic 
behaviors of these layer compounds would help shed some 
light [I]. Bulk crystals of these layer compounds, however, 
are thin in the c-direction (- 0.1 mm) and thicker (2-4 
mm) in the ab directions. This makes the measurements of 
out-of-plane behaviours, i.e., the properties along c-direc- 
tion, much more difficult. 
As a means to solve this problem, thin film deposition 
has been successfully used to fabricate c- and u-oriented 
materials with c- or a-axis, respectively, perpendicular to 
the substrate (or film) surface [2-41. While c-films are 
now almost the state-of-the-art, u-films are more difficult 
to produce in a reliable fashion. Both c- and a-films are 
usually deposited on a {IOO} surface of a substrate with 
cubic structure. During thin film growth, the film c-axis 
has almost equal access to the substrate (100) axis as 
c _ 3b and the difference in lattice constants a (m 3.82 A) 
and b (- 3.88 A) is small. Twin structures are thus a 
common problem in achieving high quality in-plane c- 
alignment for an a-oriented film [S]. 
To tackle this problem, {I IO}-cut substrates, instead of 
the {OOl}-cut used in c- or a-films, have been found to be 
able to limit the access of the in-plane c-axis to the

deposition conditions are largely contained [6]. Although 
{ l03)-phase, with film c-axis tilting _ 45” may also de- 
velop under certain growth conditions [7], there is a tem- 
perature and pressure range in which the in-plane aligned 
{I IO}-phase would be more favorable. We have been able 
to successfully fabricate pure {I IO&oriented YBCO thin 
films with no discernible (103) phase, as judged by the 
X-ray analysis based on the symmetry of the YBCO-IO8 
pole figure. 
This work is part of an effort aiming at understanding 
the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics that govern 
the film structure in relation to deposition conditions. By 
varying deposition temperature and pressure, we have 
observed consistent crystallographic transition. Ion beam 
channeling techniques have been used to characterize crys- 
tal orientation and film quality in general. We have found 
better lattice match to the substrate for low temperature 
deposition as films tend to exist in tetragonal form (a = b) 
despite the oxygen deficiency and related poor supercon- 
ducting properties. As temperature rises (accompanied by 
increasing pressure) in order to achieve higher oxygen 
content, orthorhombic structure develops accordingly in 
the film. Lattice mismatch with the substrate, which would 
have been abrupt, is now accommodated by the template 
zone through the gradually varying lattice constants. This 
article reports the observation of such gradual change via 
channeling analysis. 
2. Sample preparations and experimental setups 
The YBCO samples used in this work were deposited 
on heated SrTiO, substrate in Ar and 0, mixture (_ 2: 1) 
using an inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering gun [8]. 
The YBCO targets were powder compressed and sintered

hollow cylinder (50 mm X 40 mm X 25 mm). The sub- 
strate temperatures for deposition employed in this study 
were 575, 745, and 785°C at which a total pressure of 80, 
280, and 320 mTorr, respectively, was applied. 
Typical purely {l IO&oriented films produced with this 
system shows Tc, of 80-86 K with transition width 
(lo-90%) of 1-3 K. Meanwhile, typical A(28) of the 
{ 1 lo)-peak in X-ray 20 scan was less than 0.085”. As 
mentioned earlier, the (110) and { 103) phases have very 
similar inter-planar lattice spacing and hence difficult to 
resolve, pole figure was used to further confu-rn the phase 
purity. 
RBS channeling measurements were performed at the 
1.7 MeV Pelletron Tandem accelerator at Texas Center For 
Superconductivity, University of Houston. The ion beam 
passes through two 0.5 mm apertures, which are 1 m apart. 
The samples were mounted on a three-axis goniometer 
with 0.01” accuracy. 3.05 MeV o-particles and 6 MeV 
Li3+ ions were used for different measurements. 3.05 
MeV o-particles were used for thinner films with enhanced 
sensitivity for oxygen due to the 3.05 MeV resonance of 
160. The 6 MeV Li3+ ion beam was used for thicker films in order to increase the window between the Ba-Y surface 
edge. 
We used dilute HCI to etch out part of our film samples 
to reduce dechanneling effect while channeling the sub- 
strate. 
3. Results and discussions 
Fig. 1 depicts the crystal orientations of the { 110) and 
{ 103) phases. Fig. 2 shows the distinct differences between 
a (1 lo} and a { 103) pattern, where peaks l-4 represent the 
symmetry of { 110) phase and peaks 5-12 represent the 
symmetry of (103) phase. A typical channeling measure- 
ment for an (1 IO&oriented film with He*+ is shown in 
Fig. 3. The minimum channeling yield of Ba-RBS was 
about 20% for the _ 4000 A thick film. The lowest 
minimum yield measured on the best {I 10) film prepared 
in our laboratory was about 13-15%, as compared to 
< 6% for a typical c-film. The stoichiometry of Y, Ba and 
Cu was close to 1: 2 : 3 with a maximum deviation of 
- 10%. The reduced backscattering yields in the surface 
region are different in spectrum 2 and 3, representing, 
respectively, the channeling along the film and substrate 
[l lo] directions. The difference between film- and sub- 
strate-aligned spectra suggests a misalignment between the 
[ 1 lo] channels of the film and the substrate. The degree of 
this misalignment depends on the film growth conditions. 
To analyze the Ba peak throughout the film thickness in an 
angular scan, we used a 6 MeV Li3+ beam with which the 
Y- and Ba-peaks can be clearly separated. 
In making direct comparisons among various angular 
scans, we etched out part of the film so as to reduce 
dechanneling effect while channeling the substrate. After 
aligning the samples with substrate [l lo] direction, we

mTorr. values !lf,,* of the film are comparable with the one of the 
substrate. However, the minimum yield of the film angular 
scan always shifts from the substrate minimum yield, 
which suggests that the film [ 1 lo] channel direction has a 
small misalignment with the substrate [ 1 lo] channel direc- 
tion. From Fig. 4, it can be seen clearly that the shifts 
depend on the growth conditions. At 575”C/80 mTorr, the 
angle of shift is hardly identifiable, while at 745”C/280 
mTorr, the shift reaches a maximum value of _ 1”. 
This phenomenon can be qualitatively explained by the 
orthorhombic structure of the YBCO crystal. The angle of 
the shift reflects the oxygen content in the film. As in 
YBCO crystal, an increase of oxygen content leads to a 
decrease in lattice constant in c- and u-directions and an 
increase in b-direction. The more oxygen, the larger the 
difference between the a- and b-axis. Fig. 5 shows the 
[l lo] direction of the SrTiO, substrate, sketched as a 
simple cubic lattice, is perpendicular to its surface. When 
the YBCO film, which has an orthorhombic structure, 
grows on the SrTiO,, the angle between the film [I lo] 
direction and the substrate [ 1 lo] direction can be easily

calculated as (Y = 90” - 2(tan- ’ a/b). For a fully oxi- 
dized YBa,Cu,O,, this angle could be as large as 0.9”. 
which is consistent with our experimental results. In the 
film grown under 575”C/80 mTorr, the low oxygen con- 
tent YBCO film, it has a tetragonal structure (a = b) so 
that the shift angle (a) is zero. Grown under the optimal 
condition (745”C/280 mTorr). the high oxygen content 
film, which has an orthorhombic structure, has its [I IO] 
direction 1” off the substrate [llO] direction. In other 
intermediate cases, since the oxygen content 6 (= 7 - x) 
is between 6 and 7, the angle of shift falls between 0” and 
I”. 
4. Conclusion 
We have investigated (1 IO]-oriented YBaCuO thin film 
on SrTiO, substrate. The X-ray results indicated high 
purity {l IO]-phase. Besides the x,,,~,, the comparison of 
the q,,, of the substrate and the film shows good film 
quality. In the RBS channeling study, we observed a 
misorientation between the film [ 1 lo] direction and the substrate [l lo] direction. It has been interpreted as due to 
the lattice mismatch between YBCO film and the SrTiO, 
substrate. We speculated that the value of the angle of shift 
reflected the oxygen content in the YBCO film.
