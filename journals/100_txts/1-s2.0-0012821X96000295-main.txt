Abstract 
We present data on He sorption in garnet obtained by loading garnet samples with He at 250 + 10 bar in the temperature 
range 800-990°C. For this temperature range we find a three-fold decrease in He sorption from 2.1 . 10F5 (800°C) to 
0.72 . lo-’ cm3 STPg- ’ bar- ’ (990°C). We use the sorption data of partially saturated samples to obtain the activation 
energy (E, = 660 k :g kJ/mol) and frequency factor (D, = 1015~q+**~s~2) cm2/s> for He diffusion in garnet. 
The results of our study suggest that garnet is probably one of the most retentive silicate minerals for He, which is in 
agreement with its very low ion porosity. The high retentivity results in a high closure temperature (T,) for the (U + Th)-He 
system. For cooling rates as low as O.l-l”C/Ma, T, lies between 590” and 630°C. Accordingly, (U + Th)-He dating of 
garnet may provide information about the medium to high temperature cooling path of a rock at the lower end of the 
temperature range of currently used isotopic systems in garnet. In addition, the high retentivity for He makes garnet a 
potentially useful mineral in the field of exposure age dating. Currently, it is the only-known common silicate mineral 
occurring in upper crustal rocks which probably retains cosmogenic noble gases under all climatic conditions. For 
geochemical studies using noble gases as tracers for geofluids, garnet is a perfect container if temperatures never exceed 
600°C; that is, all originally trapped noble gases are quantitatively retained.

1. Introduction 
Diffusion studies on helium in natural samples are 
directed at assessing either the suitability of a min- 
era1 for dating [l-3] or the ability of a mineral to preserve a geochemically relevant noble gas signa- 
ture in fluid inclusions or in its lattice [4-61. Helium 
measurements in garnet, the object of the present 
study, have potential applications in both these fields; 
namely, dating and geochemical tracing. Ther- 
mochronological information at the low-temperature 
side of currently used decay schemes is potentially 
available by application of the (U + Th)-He method

noble gases are used as tracers for fluids in the 
continental crust, garnet also holds promise. To date, 
it is the only common mineral in the crust which has 
been shown to preserve primary high-grade fluid 
inclusions [7-91. Furthermore, garnet is able to pre- 
serve relics of very ancient noble gas signatures 
[lo-121. 
Here we present He sorption data of garnets 
loaded with He at temperatures between 800” and 
990°C. This data is used to derive the activation 
energy and frequency factor of He diffusion in gar- 
net. The results are discussed in the context of using 
garnet in both geochronological and geochemical 
tracer studies. 
2. Sample material 
The garnets used for the experiments were alman- 
dine-rich pyropes with minor grossular and spessar- 
tine components (Pyr,, Alm,Gro,Sp, ). They also 
contained traces of P,O, and TiO, ( - 0.1 and _ 0.02 
wt%, respectively). Their Fe+3/Fe2f ratios varied 
between 0.02 and 0.04 (Mbssbauer spectroscopy, W. 
Lottermoser, pers. commun.). The tumbled material 
comes from Orissa, India, and was mined for com- 
mercial purposes. The precise location of the mining 
operation is unknown. 
Each individual stone (0 5-10 mm) was in- 
spected in immersion oil under the binocular micro- 
scope with transmitted and reflected light. Transmit- 
ted light reveals compact inclusions, whilst reflected 
light is essential to reveal rutile needles. All stones 
with visible inclusions at 4O-fold magnification were 
discarded as potential sample material. The optical 
examination was facilitated by the smooth and pol- 
ished surfaces of the tumbled stones. By crushing 
and sieving two individual garnets we prepared the 
following grain size fractions: 6-l 1 pm, 1 l-20 
pm, 11-30 pm, 30-60 pm and 120-145 pm. 
Grain sizes > 30 pm were dry-sieved whereas 
smaller grain sizes were sieved using filter pressing 
in acetone. We could not avoid adhesion of the 
smallest grain sizes and the nominal 6-l 1, 11-20 
and 1 l-30 pm grain size fractions contain variable 
but significant amounts (up to 40 vol.%) of much 
smaller grains, as small as 0.5 pm (0.5 pm is the 
lower detection limit of the Ultra-fine Particle Ana- lyzer (UPA) used). However, the precise knowledge 
of the actual grain sizes in these small grain size 
fractions is not crucial, because we only use them to 
obtain He saturation concentrations. Low-tempera- 
ture diffusive loss from the finest grains, however, 
did occur and needs to be taken into consideration 
when determining saturation concentrations (see be- 
low). The grain size distribution of the 30-60 pm 
fraction has a median of about 45 pm (UPA), a 
value which is later used for the diffusion calcula- 
tions. The 120-145 pm fraction was too coarse for 
the UPA used and we take the geometric mean of 
132.5 pm for later calculations. The grains were 
optically examined and were found to be roughly 
spherical and not appreciably elongated. Spheres 
were manufactured from two other garnets by cutting 
garnets into cubes and subsequently abrading them 
following the method of Bond [13]. Diameters of 
those fabricated garnet spheres had a maximum vari- 
ability of 1%. Diameters were determined optically 
as well as mechanically and are given in Table 1. 
3. Methods 
From structural considerations, and by compari- 
son of garnet ion porosity with that of olivine, we 
expected a similar, if not higher He retentivity in 
garnet than in olivine [ 143. Thus, step-wise heating 
experiments would have to be carried out at tempera- 
tures greater than 900°C to release accurately mea- 
surable fractions of He in a reasonable time (garnets 
used contained 0.3-2.5 * 1O-6 cm3STP/g radiogenic 
4He). At these temperatures, however, the almandine 
component is meta-stable (reaction almandine # 
fayalite + cordierite + herzynite + fluid located at 
N 82O”C, 250 bar, fo2 at IW/IM, 1153). As the 
garnet used for our experiments has a considerable 
almandine component, we anticipated unstable ’ be- 
haviour of our samples during in vacua heating 
experiments. Therefore, we dismissed the idea of 
conventional step-wise heating experiments as it 
would have been impossible to prove the (meta- 
stability of samples throughout the experiments. 
High-temperature release experiments, which would 
allow investigations for phase transitions, were con- 
ducted in the reconnaissance stage of the project, but 
were found to be unsuitable for the highly variable

natural He concentrations in the sample material. 
Instead, we chose to reverse conventional step-wise 
heating experiments; that is, to load the garnets at a 
high pressure with He and subsequently measure the 
incorporated He. Although this approach requires 
loading temperatures exceeding the almandine stabil- 
ity field, the garnet can be studied for signs of 
instability after loading and prior to He analysis. The iron content in garnet required additional 
experimental precautions. The possibility of Fe loss 
into the Pt capsule and redox reactions had to be 
considered. To prevent Fe loss we used a double 
capsule technique. We loaded the garnet samples 
into garnet crucibles that were manufactured from 
the same material as the samples. The garnet cru- 
cibles were placed in a Pt capsule of 4 mm outer and 
3.6 mm inner diameter and 20 mm length (Fig. 1). 
This assembly was dried for about 1 min at 500°C. 
Subsequently, the capsule was filled with 50-60 bar 
He and sealed following the method of [16]. To 
study the control of oxygen fugacity on the experi- 
ments, some were performed with an Fe/Fe0 buffer 
in the capsules. MGssbauer spectrometric investiga- 
tion of buffered and unbuffered samples prior to and 
after loading revealed no shifts in Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios 
during the loading experiments. 
Usually two capsules were mounted obliquely in a 
ceramic holder and placed in an internally heated 
pressure vessel at 250 f 10 bar using Ar as the 
pressure-transmitting medium. The pressure was lim- 
ited to 250 bar to prevent strong compaction of Pt 
capsules and subsequent destruction of the garnet 
crucibles. Run temperatures were between 800” and 
990°C and run times varied between 18 and 500 h. 
We conducted no zero time runs because run times 
are all much longer than the time required to reach 
experimental conditions. Table 1 summarizes experi-

mental conditions. Pressure readings were taken with 
a Burster (8219R) pressure sensor and a DVM read 
out (type 9151). They were checked against a cali- 
brated Heise manometer. The thermocouple (Pt- 
Pt9ORhlO) was placed into the ceramic holder be- 
tween the two samples. The thermocouple was 
checked under pressure against the melting point of 
Au and is accurate to < +2 K. The temperature 
gradient over the length of the capsule is + 10K. 
After loading at high temperatures the samples were 
quenched at about 400 K/min. 
To minimize diffusive loss in the finest grain size 
fractions the samples were stored in liquid nitrogen 
after loading. Usually, the samples were at room 
temperature for less than 1 week prior to He analy- 
sis. Some samples were left uncooled for 2 months 
because the automated nitrogen filling system failed 
(Table 1). Duplicate measurements of aliquots cooled 
in liquid nitrogen and purposely uncooled for 9 
months, indicate a diffusive loss of about 25% and 
O-15% for the 6-11 and 11-20 pm grain size 
fractions during that period, respectively (Fig. 2). 
The finest grain sizes were checked for signs of 
instability, because changes would most likely occur 
in these first. We used X-ray diffraction and 
Miissbauer spectroscopy to check for new phases 
and for changes in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, respec- 
tively. Spheres were inspected for surface changes with an ESEM (Environmental-SEM, Electroscan@ >, 
which allowed study of samples without any coating. 
In one experiment (V65, 99O”C, 69 h) garnet break- 
down was macroscopically evident and samples were 
discarded. In another experiment (V68,99O”C, 18 h 
35 min) X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the pres- 
ence of new phases. Furthermore, the garnet peaks 
were broadened. The spheres of this experiment 
suffered severe surface alteration. To illustrate the 
effect of garnet instability the latter samples were 
nevertheless analyzed and we found that garnet in- 
stability increased the apparent solubility consider- 
ably (Table 1). In all experiments where garnet was 
found to be stable, a change in Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios 
could not be resolved analytically (W. Lottermoser, 
pers. commun.). 
Helium was analyzed by mass spectrometer after 
being released by heating the samples to 1800°C for 
15 min. The samples were not baked prior to analy- 
sis. Typical blanks during the course of the investiga- 
tion were l-2 . lo-” cm3STP He. The reproducibil- 
ity of He abundance determinations of a noble gas 
standard processed in exactly the same way as the 
samples is 1% (1 u >. A description of the analytical 
equipment and the analytical procedure is given in 
IlOl. 
4. Results 
The sorption data for all grain size fractions ana- 
lyzed are given in Table 1. In general, we observed a 
decrease in He sorption with increasing grain size. 
Here we use the finest grain sizes to derive estimates 
of the saturation concentrations. Data of the larger, 
partially saturated, grain sizes is later used for the 
calculation of the diffusion coefficients. Sorption 
data for the fine grain size fractions are displayed in 
Fig. 2. For each temperature the lower He concentra- 
tions are always observed in those samples which 
were uncooled for long periods of time (2-9 months), 
whereas permanently cooled samples invariably have 
the highest concentrations. We therefore explain the 
low He concentrations of the uncooled samples as 
artefacts of low-temperature diffusive loss of He 
from ultra fine particles (< 1 pm) prior to analysis. 
The data of the uncooled samples is thus not used.

We take the good agreement obtained for the 6- 11 
and 11-20 pm fractions loaded for 24 h 50 min and 
116 h 30 min @OO”C), respectively, as an indication 
that these samples are effectively saturated. Experi- 
ments designed to prove saturation at 800°C and 
990°C; that is, using longer loading time or finer 
grain sizes, failed because the Pt capsules leaked or 
garnet was no longer meta-stable (Table 1). Never- 
theless, we consider the 1 l-30 pm grains loaded at 
990°C for 18 h to be saturated because of the faster 
diffusion at higher temperature. It is, however, very 
likely that the grains loaded at 800°C for 191 h 
(1 l-20 pm) are not completely saturated. We take 
this view because He diffusion at 800°C is more than 
100 times slower than at 900°C (see below) and the 
maximum duration of (successful) experiments at 
800°C was only 1 l/2 times as long as the loading 
time for the same grain size at 900°C; that is, the 
samples loaded at 800°C would only be saturated if 
saturation at 900°C occurs within - 20 min. 
From the highest concentrations obtained for each 
temperature we obtained Henry coefficients for He 
sorption in garnet. These are: 2.1 . 10e5, 1.6. low5 
and 0.72 - 10m5 cm3STPg-’ bar- ’ for 800”, 900” 
and 990°C respectively. 
5. Discussion 
5.1. He sorption in garnet 
Currently, the solubility of noble gases in natural 
minerals is not well understood. Different samples of 
the same mineral display different sorption be- 
haviour and reported solubilities may vary by up to 
l-2 orders of magnitude [ 17,181. Furthermore, there 
is no ‘consensus on the preferred trapping sites of 
noble gases. Broadhurst and co-workers [ 17,181 
favour lattice vacancies whereas Hiyagon and Ozima 
[19] favour interstitial lattice sites. A recent study of 
Ar sorption in quartz [20] reveals heterogenous Ar 
distribution in the samples, which implies a consider- 
able influence of structural defects (e.g., extended 
dislocations and fluid inclusions). Although there is 
currently no clearly demonstrated solubility model 
(see also [21 I), below we discuss our presently pre- 
ferred view on mechanisms for He sorption in garnet 
in the light of our data. The ideal, undisturbed structure of garnet lacks 
large structural voids that may host He (atomic 
diameter of He is 0.93 A, [22]). Thus non-ideal 
phenomena, such as extended dislocations and point 
defects, must provide the voids that may be occupied 
by He. Besides serving as potential trapping sites for 
helium, extended dislocations may serve as fast path- 
ways of He transport, thereby affecting the kinetics 
of sorption. Garnet has the proven ability to anneal 
severe lattice damage, such as, for example, fission 
tracks in laboratory experiments. Fission tracks are 
erased after about 10 h at 660°C ([23] and references 
therein). Due to the fact that we conducted our 
experiments at 800°C and above and for 18 or more 
hours, we assume that extended defects were effec- 
tively annealed at the end of our experiments. This 
means that the extended dislocations could only ac- 
celerate He sorption in the first few hours of the 
experiments. However, since extended dislocations 
are orders of magnitude faster pathways of He trans- 
port than volume diffusion [24], the sorption results 
of partially saturated samples would be dominated 
by the effects of extended dislocations. Indeed, we 
observe that, partially saturated sample aliquots of 
the same grain size (30-60 pm) loaded at 900°C for 
25 and 117 h, contain almost identical amounts of 
He. This observation is in agreement with the con- 
cept that dislocations are important for the kinetics 
of sorption but only active for few hours. We expect 
that the former locations of annealed extended dislo- 
cations may be detected as areas of enhanced He 
sorption until volume diffusion erases concentration 
gradients. For the larger grain sizes (> 30 pm) the 
duration of this process clearly exceeds the time 
scale of our experiments. Similar behaviour of sam- 
ples; that is, near constancy of noble gas concentra- 
tion after varying loading times, can be found for He 
in olivine (K.R. and T.J.D., unpublished data) and 
for Ar in quartz [20]. 
A generally available trapping site for He in 
garnet are the point defects created by charge com- 
pensation for aliovalent chemical substitutions. The 
crystal chemistry of garnet allows for a variety of 
such substitutions. Among them are: Pv+, A13+, 
Fe2+*3+, replacing Si4+ in the tetrahedral site, Ti4+ 
replacing Al 3+ in the octahedral site and Ti4+, A13+, 
Fe3+ replacing di-valent ions on the triangular do- 
decahedron site [25]. Up to 5 . 10” vacancies/g are 
416 T.J. Dunai, K. Roselieb / Earth and Planetary Science Letters I39 (1996) 41 l-421 
created by the 0.048 wt% P we find in our garnet. 
Further vacancies may be created if a small portion 
of the Fe3+ is not on the octahedral site but in the 
triangular dodecahedral site (for each 1% fraction of 
Fe3+ on dodecahedral sites, 3. lOI vacancies/g are 
created). In both cases these numbers are higher than 
the number of He atoms we find in our saturated 
samples (0.5-1.5 . 1017 atom/g>. Therefore, in prin- 
ciple, the measured sorption could be accounted for 
by point defects alone. On basis of the present data 
set, however, we hesitate to assess the relative im- 
portance of point defects versus extended disloca- 
tions. 
A prominent feature of Fig. 2 is the temperature 
dependence of He sorption. In the temperature range 
between 800” and 99O“C, He sorption decreases by a 
factor of 3. The temperature dependence may well be 
even more pronounced, considering the fact that the 
grains were probably not saturated at 800°C (see 
above). Decreasing solubilities with temperature are 
also observed for other noble gases in other minerals. 
Similar tendencies are reported for He in tridymite 
and cristobalite, as well as for Ne, Ar and Kr in 
sod&e and cancrinite 126,271. 
5.2. He dfision in garnet, a comparison 
Diffusion coefficients were determined from the 
concentration ratio of the partially saturated grains/ 
spheres and the saturated powders using the follow- 
ing equation: 
Mb -= 1 
MO -5. F f.e(-n2.7rZ.D.t/a2) 
n=l 
after 1281. 
Where, M, = the saturation concentration; Mb = 
the concentration of the partially saturated samples; 
t = the loading duration; a = the radius of the spheres 
or grains. The equation was solved numerically for 
D for n = 1 to n = 1000. Diffusion coefficients ob- 
tained are given in Table 1 and plotted as a function 
of temperature in Fig. 3. 
For each temperature there is a wide range of D 
values. For the 800°C experiments the D values vary 
almost 3 orders of magnitude. The variation for the 
900” and 990°C experiments is significantly lower 
but still considerable. Although greatest care was Fig. 3. Arrhenius diagram for diffusion coefficients of He in 
garnet at 8OO”, 900” and 990°C. Symbols are usually larger than 
errors of D. Numbers to the right of the symbols give grain sizes 
in microns and the run time in hours. The lower solid tie-line 
gives the minimum estimate for volume diffusion of He in garnet 
(E, = 660* I;$ kJ/mol and D, = 10’5.q+ ‘,- ‘.*) cm*/sec). Only 
the 900” and 990°C experiments are considered because the 
saturation concentration of He at 800°C is not well enough 
constrained and probably higher than determined (D values are 
too high, see text). The upper line potentially delineates shortcut 
diffusion 1241. 
taken in the selection of suitable starting material, we 
see this variability in D values as an indication of 
extended structural defects in the garnets used. We 
take the decrease in the variability in D values from 
lower to higher temperatures as an indication that the 
defects anneal in the course of the loading experi- 
ments. This finding is also supported by the consis- 
tently lower D values obtained for samples loaded 
for 116.5 h at 900°C compared to those loaded for 25 
h at the same temperature (Fig. 3). Given a random 
distribution of extended structural defects, large 
grains should have a greater probability to ,:ontain 
such defects than small ones. Furthermore, the rela- 
tive importance of defects tends to be larger in 
coarse grains than in small ones [24]. Indeed, we find 
that the large spheres often have the highest D 
values. It is, however, noteworthy that for 900“ and 
800°C the lowest D values are obtained for spheres 
with a diameter of 680 pm. This may indicate that 
the garnets used have domains larger than 680 pm 
that are virtually free of extended structural defects.

We use the lowest D values obtained for the 900” 
and 990°C fractions to derive the activation energy, 
E,, and frequency factor, D,, of volume diffusion. 
The corresponding values are 660(+ :z$ kJ/mol 
and 1015.q+8V-5-21 cm*/sec, respectively. We do not 
include the lowest diffusivities for 800°C because the 
saturation concentration obtained for this tempera- 
ture is probably too low (see above). The calculated 
diffusivities are thus too high. We use only the 
lowest D values of the remaining temperatures in 
order to obtain, as close as possible, an estimate of 
ideal volume diffusion. Both the calculated E, and 
D,, are minimum values. This is because the lowest 
D value for 990°C is rather well defined by three 
independent experiments and we therefore assume 
that this value is close to the actual value of volume 
diffusion. At the same time, we cannot exclude 
lower D values for 900°C. Thus, the slope of the 
tie-line may be steeper and the y-axis intercept may 
be shifted to higher values. The highest D values 
may be used to estimate E, and D, of shortcut 
diffusion; that is, the diffusion along structural de- 
fects. The corresponding values are 490(+ E”) 
kJ/mol and lO9.9(+6*-3.8) cm2/sec, respectively. 
To date, there are only few published studies on 
high temperature (> 700°C) He diffusion in miner- 
als. Only data on olivine and diopside have been 
reported so far (Fig. 4) [4,5,29]. The principal diffi- 
culty in comparing the results of these studies to ours 
is the difference in the sites on which He is trapped. 
All previous studies investigated samples that con- 
tained He almost exclusively in CO, fluid inclu- 
sions, whereas in our samples He is trapped in lattice 
defects. Therefore, the diffusion data on olivine and 
diopside is complicated by the partitioning between 
fluid and crystalline phases (for detailed discussion 
see 151). The consequence is that the diffusion coeffi- 
cients obtained may be several orders of magnitude 
too low. Trull and Kurz [51 assessed to possibility of 
correcting their data for those effects and obtained 
rather high corrected diffusivities for He, higher than 
for basalt melt, which they explained by the high 
defect abundance in their samples. Following the 
arguments of [5], we consider the experimentally 
derived diffusion coefficients for He in olivine and 
diopside as minimum values (Fig. 4). Consequently, 
we note that garnet is probably the most retentive 
silicate mineral for He known, because our values lb00 1400 1200 loo0

Data from [4], [5] and this study. 
are probably maximum values. This finding is in 
good agreement with the very low ion porosity (IP) 
of garnet, which is the among lowest of all crustal 
silicates, for example, the garnet investigated has an 
IP as low as 27%. whereas diopside and olivine have 
considerably higher IPs of 34% and 35%, respec- 
tively (at 24”C, [ 141). 
5.3. Geochronological applications 
In order to derive an idea of the temperature at 
which the (II + Th)-He system becomes isolated in 
garnet we use the closure temperature (T,) concept 
of Dodson [30]. We find that a garnet of 350 pm 
radius has a T, for He between 590” and 630°C for 
cooling rates between 0.1 and l”C/Ma (Fig. 5). We 
take 350 pm as the example because the largest 
grains which displayed a close to ideal volume diffu- 
sion behaviour were of this size. For practical pur- 
poses, this radius is probably a maximum because 
non-gem quality, that is, ‘real’ garnets will have 
smaller defect-free domains. If shortcut diffusion 
[24] dominates the above closure temperatures would 
be about 110°C lower. 
The T,s of He in garnet are at the low end of the 
range of values proposed for the Sm-Nd system 
(600-750°C; [3I-33D and significantly lower than

that of the U-Pb system (> 8OO”C, [341). Therefore, 
(U-Th)-He dating of garnet is potentially useful to 
date low- to high-grade metamorphic rocks or gar- 
net-bearing magmatic rocks. Information about the 
high to medium temperature cooling history at the 
low temperature end of currently used isotopic sys- 
tems may be obtained. Great analytical care, how- 
ever, has to be taken to assure that the splits on 
which the U-Th determination are performed are 
real aliquots of the splits used for the He determina- 
tion. For regional metamorphic garnets which con- 
tain little U and Th (e.g. [23,34]) but U-Th-rich 
mineral inclusions this precaution is especially im- 
portant. Magmatic and contact .metamorphic garnets 
(mainly grossular and spessarine) often have higher 
U and Th contents [23] and are therefore expected to 
be less problematic. Analogous to excess Ar in 
K-Ar and Ar-Ar dating, excess He may be present 
in some garnets. This exce.ss He is most probably 
trapped in fluid inclusions because of the highly 
incompatible nature of He and the tight garnet struc- 
ture. Crush-release experiments may be used to de- 
tect and correct for this excess He. 
In the field of exposure age dating, using cosmo- 
genie noble gas nuclides garnet may also prove 
useful. Garnet is common and, as our results show, 
retentive for He and, by inference, also for Ne. This combination of features is not common amongst 
rock-forming minerals. Olivine and diopside are re- 
tentive for He and Ne [5,35] but their use is limited 
to outcrops of mafic rocks. Quartz and feldspars 
potentially retain cosmogenic He only at very low 
temperatures, as found in Antarctica, whereas in 
warm areas they loose cosmogenic 3He [3,36,37]. 
We are aware that, similar to olivine, cosmogenic 
3He may diffuse faster in garnet at low temperatures 
than inferred from high temperature experiments [3]. 
This is probably due to the predominance of shortcut 
diffusion [24] along un-annealed structural defects 
(see previous section). We also see the effects of 
shortcut diffusion in our experimental data and pre- 
viously derived a lower T, for diffusion dominated 
by defects (- 480°C). For garnets from other loca- 
tions this value may be higher or lower, but probably 
always higher than surface temperatures on Earth. 
Furthermore, from structural considerations, there is 
no reason to assume that garnet is more likely to 
suffer low temperature He loss than olivine; the 
latter has the demonstrated ability to retain cosmo- 
genie ‘He in all climates. We take this view because 
olivines frequently display undulose extinction, faint 
translation lamellae (slip bands) and kink-bands (in- 
homogeous translation gliding) [38] and all these 
features indicate a high density of extended defects, 
possibly enhancing diffusion. In contrast, almandine 
and pyrope-rich garnets, the most common garnet 
species, are usually devoid of these features [381. 
Therefore, on average, they probably have less de- 
fects than olivine. Spessartine and garnets of the 
ugrandite series frequently show anomalous birefrin- 
gence [38], possibly indicating a high defect density 
due to excessive strain in the lattice. The latter garnet 
species are, anyhow, unsuitable for exposure age 
dating due to their unfavourable noble gas compo- 
nent structure, which is discussed elsewhere in detail 
WI. 
5.4. Geochemical applications 
High grade metamorphic fluids, their provenance 
and interactions with rocks, have been the objective 
of a multitude of studies. To date, garnet, or minerals 
included in garnet, are the only minerals in which 
non-reequilibrated primary, amphibolite to granulite 
TJ. Dunai, K. Roselieb/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 139 (1996) 411-421 419 
facies, fluid inclusions are found (e.g. [7-g]). There- 
fore, this suggests that fluid inclusions in garnet 
should preferably be used to characterize (peak) 
metamorphic fluids. Noble gases, especially He, may 
be used to obtain information about the provenance 
of these fluids. For instance, recent studies have 
demonstrated that carbonic fluids, involved in gran- 
ulite metamorphism in metamorphic terranes in 
southern India and northern Norway, are of mantle 
origin [lo-121. For such studies it is important to 
know under what conditions a primary He isotopic 
signature may be preserved. If this is not known it is 
impossible to judge whether the absence of a mantle 
signature is indicative for the absence of mantle 
fluids at any stage of the evolution of the rock, or 
simply reflects that (mantle) helium was lost since 
the time of fluid entrapment. 
The ‘characteristic diffusive length’ defined as 
X = (Dt>‘/* gives an conceptual idea of over which 
distance a He signature may be dispersed. In total, 
99% of diffusive loss, gain or exchange of helium 
occurs in a spherical volume with a diameter X in 
time t and 50% of transfer in about l/lOth of t [5]. 
When X is greater than the grain size or the size of 
diffusion domains He may be considered lost. As 
before, we assume that the maximum size of diffu- 
sion domains in garnet is probably in the order of 
700 ,wm. For this diameter, complete equilibration is 
achieved in about 1 Ma at 800°C and about 1 Ga at 
700°C (Fig. 6). Virtually no exchange occurs at 
temperatures below 600°C. For practical purposes 
Fig. 6. Diffusive path-length, (Dt)‘/*, of He in garnet for various 
temperatures and heating durations. this means that garnets in granulite facies rocks, if 
held at 700°C for lo- 100 Ma, may lose some of the 
He originally trapped. Furthermore, radiogenic He 
from the rock matrix will find its way into fluid 
inclusions in the garnet and start to camouflage an 
inherited mantle signature. Under these conditions 
the absence of a mantle He signature is not conclu- 
sive for the absence of syn-metamorphic, mantle-de- 
rived fluids. Only a ‘positive’ finding; that is, the 
proven presence of mantle-derived fluids is unequiv- 
ocal. Garnets from mid-amphibolite facies or lower 
grade rocks, however, will retain their originally 
trapped He quantitatively. 
6. Conclusions 
From the above the following conclusions can be 
drawn: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Extended structural defects in garnet may act as 
trapping sites for He as well as fast pathways of 
He diffusion. They affect the kinetics of sorption 
considerably, but anneal in the course of the 
experiments. In principle, point defects created by 
charge compensation for aliovalent chemical sub- 
stitutions could account for the He saturation 
concentrations measured. However, with the pre- 
sent experimental data we cannot assess the rela- 
tive contribution of extended structural defects 
versus point defects. 
Garnet is very retentive for He. We have obtained 
estimates for the activation energy, E,, and the 
pre-exponential factor, D,, of 660 f t;E kJ/mol 
and 10’5.q+8~-5.2) cm*/sec, respectively. It is 
very probable that garnet is the most retentive 
silicate mineral for He, as it has the lowest ion 
porosity of all crustal rock-forming silicates. The 
good retentivity results in a high closure tempera- 
ture of the (U + Th)-He system in garnet of 
about 600°C. 
Garnet has a great potential for use in exposure 
age dating utilizing cosmogenic noble gas nu- 
elides. Unlike quartz and feldspar, two commonly 
used crustal minerals, garnet is likely to retain 
cosmogenic noble gases quantitatively even in hot 
climates. 
Ancient He trapped in fluid inclusions is quantita-

tively retained in garnet if temperatures never 
exceed 600°C. If temperatures are around 700°C 
for several lo- 100 Ma some originally trapped 
He may be lost, and/or He components from 
outside the garnet may be added.
