The syntheses of three classes of C-3 perfluoroalkyl substituted steroids are described. They are the 3~-hydroxy- 
3o~-perfluoroalkylandrost-4-en-17-ones (5a-c), 3-perfluoroalkylandrosta-3,5-dien-3-ones (8a-c) and 3~-hydroxy- 
3o~-perfluoroalkylandrost-5-en-17-ones (12a-c). Addition of a series of perfluroalkylorganometallic reagents 
(RFLi; R F = C2F s, C3F 7, or C4F9) to the 3 position of silylated testosterone 2b afforded A4perfluoroalkyl 
carbinols 3. In Scheme 1, deprotection with HF and oxidation at the C-17 carbon with PCC produced A 4 ketones 
5. In Scheme 2 dehydration of 3 with 1,2-phenylenephosphorochloridite and iodine afforded A 3'5 dienes 6 which 
were deprotected and oxidized as above to the C-17 ketones 8. In Scheme 3 isomerization of the double bond of 
3 from the C-4 to the C-5 position using the allylic halogenation followed by treatment with lithium aluminum 
hydride led to the synthesis of the double bond isomer series 12. A new method for dehydration was developed. 
On average and within experimental error, 3~-hydroxy-3o~-perfluoroalkylandrost-5-en-17 ones (12a-c) were 
better than the 3-perfluoroalkylandrosta-3,5-dien-17-ones (8a-c) and 3~-hydroxy-3o~-perfluoroalkylandrost-4- 
en-17-ones (5a-c) at inhibiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. (Steroids 61:50-57, 1996)

Introduction 
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, 3[3-hydroxyandrost-5-en- 
17-one, la) together with its sulfate are the most abundant 
adrenal steroids in humans. DHEA has been shown to have 
a number of beneficial biological effects in animals. 1 Some 
of these properties have been explained by the fact that 
DHEA is an inhibitor of the important enzyme glucose-6- 
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). 2 However, DHEA can 
be metabolized to estrogens which are known tumor pro- 
moters.1 Previous work in our laboratories has shown that 
the hydrophobic A-ring steroid, 3[3-methylandrost-5-en-17- 
one lb is an excellent inhibitor of the G6PDH. 3 It is also 
known that incorporation of fluorine can impart useful bi- 
ological properties to organic molecules. 4'5 As part of a 
program designed to prepare more biologically active ana- 
logs of DHEA which would not be metabolized to estro- 
gens, a series of 3[3-hydroxy-3-perfluoroalkyl substituted A 4 
and AS-androsten-17-ones and A3'5-androstadien-17-ones 
were synthesized. They are the 3~-hydroxy-3cx-per- 
fluoroalkyl-androst-4-en-17-ones (5a-c), 3-perfluoroalkyl- 
androsta-3,5-dien-17-ones (8a-c), and 3~-hydroxy-3~-

655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 perfluoroalkylandrost-5-en-17-ones (12a-c). The perfluoro- 
alkyl groups were: a = C2F 5, b = C3F 7 and c = C4F 9. 
Experimental 
All reagents and solvents were used as supplied without further 
purification unless otherwise noted. Hexanes were distilled 
through a 40 × 3 cm Vigreux column before use. Ether and meth- 
ylene chloride were obtained from Aldrich in Sure-Seal bottles and 
transferred under an inert atmosphere. Analytical thin-layer chro- 
matography (TLC) was conducted using Analtech silica gel GF 
plates (250 microns) containing a fluorescent indicator. Detection 
was performed by observation under UV light or by iodine stain- 
ing. Preparative TLC was carried out using 20 cm 2 silica gel GF 
plates (1000 microns). Flash column chromatography was per- 
formed using Merck silica gel 50 (230-400 mesh). 
Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary 
melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were re- 
corded on a Mattson 4040 FT IR spectrometer and the data re- 
ported in wavenumbers (cm-l). ~H and 13C NMR spectra were 
recorded on a GE QE 300 (at 300 MHz and 75.48 MHz, respec- 
tively) spectrometer. Spectra were recorded in CDC13 with chem- 
ical shift values in ppm relative to the solvent peak (7.26 ppm for 
~H and 77.0 for 13C). ~H and J3C NMR assignments were made 
from a combination of DEPT (distortionless enhancement by po- 
larization transfer) spectra in conjunction with ~H and J3C chem- 
ical shift comparisons and substituent increments. 6'7 Low resolu- 
tion mass spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard HP 5995 
direct inlet mass spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra

G6DPH inhibition was determined essentially as described by Oer- 
tel and Rebeleinf Bovine adrenal G6PDH, G6P disodium salt, 
NADP-free acid, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 
(TRIZMA) buffer were purchased from Sigma Biochemicals. Di- 
oxane was either freshly distilled from Na°/benzophenone ketyl or 
obtained directly from a freshly opened bottle of Aldrich anhy- 
drous dioxane. Freshly prepared stock solutions of inhibitor ( 1.5 x 
10 -~ M in dioxane), G6PDH (-34 U/mL H20), NADP (3 x 10 -3 
M), MgC12. 6 H20 (6 x 10 2 M), and G6P (2.3 x 10 i M) were 
prepared. The inhibitor, G6PDH, NADP, and MgC12 were then 
diluted in pH 7.8, 0.03 M TRIZMA buffer solution (to a total 
volume of 3 mL) to give a final concentration of-6.9 x 10 2 U/mL 
G6PDH, 1 x 10 -5 M inhibitor (for the blank runs an equal volume 
(20 ~tL) of pure dioxane was diluted in the buffer), 2 x 10 4 M 
NADP, and 2 x 10 -3 M MgCI 2. The enzymatic reaction was then 
initiated by adding sufficient G6P stock solution to give a final 
G6P concentration of -4 x l0 3 M. The rate of formation of 
NADPH was followed by monitoring the increase in absorption of 
the NADPH chromophore at 340 nm from 0.5 rain to 7.5 rain after 
initiating the reaction. Percent inhibition = (rate of blank run - rate 
of inhibited run)/(rate of blank run) x 100%. The measurements 
are the result of two determinations. DHEA was used as a standard 
and our results were estimated to be accurate to plus or minus 10%. 
Results and discussion 
The use of perfluorinated organometallic reagents 5 affords a 
convenient route for the synthesis of perfluorinated steroids. 
The synthesis of 3~-hydroxy-3tx-perfluoroalkylandrost-4- 
en-17-ones (5a-c) is described in Scheme 1. The 17-hydrox- 
yl of testosterone 2a was first protected as the t-butyldim- 
ethylsilyl (TBDMS) ether 9 in 93% yield. Addition of the 
appropriate perfluoroalkyllithium reagents using the method 
of Gassman and O'Reilly ~° afforded the tertiary carbinols 
3a-c in 80-85% yield. Only one product was obtained 
which was assigned to be the [3-alcohol based on literature 
precedent in the reduction of A4-3-keto steroids.l 1 Further, 
the IR, MS, and JH and J3C NMR data (see Table 1) on the 
new steroids 3-12, were fully in accord with the assigned 
structures. Deprotection of the TBDMS ether with aqueous 
HF in acetonitrile produced 4a-e in 85-89% yield. 12 Oxi- 
dation of the secondary alcohol to a ketone with PCC af- 
forded the 313-hydroxy-3a-perfluoroalkylandrost-4-en-17- 
ones (5a-c) in 76-82% yield.13

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 3[3-hydroxy-3c~-perfluoroalkylandrost- 
5-en-17-ones 12a-c. The 3-perfluoroalkylandrosta-3,5-dien-17-ones (Sa-e) 
were prepared as described in Scheme 2 starting with same 
intermediate 3 from the previous synthesis. Attempts to de- 
hydrate this system using the method of Weintraub et al. 14 
(HCl/acetone) failed producing the deprotected diol 4. De- 
hydration using phosphorus oxychloride or thionyl chloride 
in pyridine afforded the desired product as well as 20% of 
3-chloro-3-perfluoroalkylandrost-4-en- 17-OTBDMS. The 
difficulty in dehydrating the tertiary alcohol 3 is due to the 
attachment of the very electronegative perfluoroalkyl group 
at C-3 and has been observed previously in other systems. 15 
A new method for the clean dehydration of 3 was discov- 
ered using 1,2-phenylene phosphorochloridite and iodine 
with pyridine in methylene chloride. This method produced 
the 3,5-dienes 6a-c in 77-86% yield. To gain insight into 
the mechanism of this useful reaction, the experiment was 
repeated leaving out the iodine. The product formed was not 
the diene 6 but the 3-phosphite which was the intermediate 
for the 3-iodination. 16 Also, treatment of 3 with iodine in 
methylene chloride afforded only starting material. A pos- 
sible explanation for these observations is that it is a free 
radical reaction. Deprotection of the TBDMS ethers 6a-e 
with aqueous HF in acetonitrile produced the alcohols 7a-e 
in 73-77% yield. 12 Oxidation of the secondary alcohol to a 
ketone as before with PCC afforded the 3-perfluoroalkylan- 
drosta-3,5-dien-17-ones (8a-e) in 81% yield. 13

rost-5-en-17-ones (12a-c) is outlined in Scheme 3. The dou- 
ble bond was isomerized using the method of Knapp and 
Schroepfer. ~7 Allylic bromination of 3 with N-bromosuc- 
cinimide afforded 9a-c in 75-82% yield. Isomerization of 
the double bond using lithium aluminum hydride gave 
10a-c in 65-81% yield. Deprotection of the TBDMS ether 
with aqueous HF in acetonitrile produced the diols lla-c in 
77-91% yield. 12 Oxidation of the secondary alcohol to a 
ketone as before with PCC afforded the target 3[3-hydroxy- 
3~-perfluoroalkylandrost-5-en-17-ones (12a-c) in 73-81% 
yield. 13 
In summary, three classes of 3-substituted perfluoroalkyl 
steroids were conveniently prepared from testosterone. In 
the A 4 series, the target molecules were prepared in four 
steps with overall yields of 45-48%. The A 3"5 diene series 
was prepared in five steps with overall yields of 30-35%. 
The synthesis of A 5 ketones was achieved in six steps from 
testosterone with an overall yield of 19-25%. 
The G6DPH inhibitory properties of the 3-perfluoroalkyl 
steroids are shown in Table 2. All of the new steroids were 
comparable to DHEA in inhibiting G6DPH. The best class 
of inhibitors were the 3]3-hydroxy-3c~-perfluoroalkyland- 
rost-5-en-17-ones (12a-c). These compounds are very sim- 
ilar to DHEA structurally except that the 3o~-hydrogen is 
replaced by a perfluoroalkyl group. It is interesting that a 
large C-3 axial R F group can still fit in and bind to a hy- 
drophobic region in G6DPH. There is a slight trend favoring 
an increase in activity with an increase in R F for both the 
5-ene, 12a-c and the lesser active 4-ene series, 5a-c. The 
pseudo-equatorial 3,5-diene series 8a-c is on average 
slightly less active than the 5-ene steroids.
