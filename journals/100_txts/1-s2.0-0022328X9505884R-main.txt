Abstract 
The reaction of the anionic mononuclear rhodium complex [Rh(C,F,),Cl(Hpz)]- (Hpz = pyrazole, C3H,N,) with methoxo or 
acetylacetonate complexes of Rh or Ir led to the heterodinuclear anionic compounds [(C,F,),Rh( CL-Cl)( CL-pz)M(L*)] [M = Rh, 
L, = cycle-octa-l$diene, COD (11, tetrafluorobenzobarrelene, TFB (2) or (CO), (4); M = Ir, L, = COD (3)]. The complex 
[Rh(C,F,),(Hbim)]- (5) has been prepared by treating [Rh(C,F,),(acac>]- with H,bim (acac = acetylacetonate; H,bim = 2,2’- 
biimidazole). Complex 5 also reack with Rh or Ir methoxo, or with Pd acetylacetonate, complexes affording the heterodinuclear 
complexes [(C,Fs),Rh( CL-bim)M(L,)]- [M = Rh, L, = COD (6) or TFB (7); M = Ir, L, = COD (8); M = Pd, L, = v3-C,H, (911. With 
[Rh(acac)(CO),], complex 5 yields the tetranuclear complex [((C,F,),Rh( CL-bim)Rh(CO),),]*-. Homodinuclear Rh”’ derivatives 
[{Rh(C,F&,( p-L>,12- [L2 = OH, pz (11); OH, S’Bu (12); OH, SPh (13); bim (1411 have been obtained by substitution of one or both

1. Introduction 
Dinuclear transition-metal complexes have attracted 
considerable interest in recent years [l]. Many types of 
dinuclear complex with bridging ligands have been 
synthesized and used in studies of electron-transfer 
processes and metal-metal interactions [2]. Among 
bridging ligands, azolate-type heterocycles can yield 
dinuclear homo- or hetero-metallic complexes with in- 
teresting properties [3]. One of the synthetic routes to 
azolate dinuclear complexes is the reaction of mononu- 
clear derivatives containing this acidic ligand with 
mononuclear compounds containing a proton abstractor 
such as methoxo or acetylacetonate groups. In this way, 
homo- or hetero-dinuclear azolate-bridged complexes 
containing ‘( p-cymene)Ru’ [4] or ‘(C,Me,)M’ (M = Rh 
[5] or Ir [6]) fragments joined to Rh’, Rh”‘, II-’ or Pd” 
have been prepared in our laboratory. Since the 
‘Rucarene)’ and ‘M”‘(C,Me,)’ units are isoelectronic 
* Corresponding author. with the ‘Rh”‘(C6F,),’ moiety, we have also researched 
the ability of this last fragment to form dinuclear com- 
pounds. For this purpose, we prepared the anionic ho- 
modinuclear complex [P(CH,Ph)Ph,],[{Rh(C,F,),},- 
( /~-Cl),1 [71 by reaction of the homoleptic [P(CH,Ph) 
Ph,],[Rh(C,F,),] [8] with HCl. Cleavage of the chloro 
bridges in this complex by neutral bidentate ligands [9], 
or their substitution by other anionic groups, such as 
halogen, pseudo-halogen or oxygen-donor ligands [IO], 
yielded homodinuclear rhodium(III) compounds. 
As a continuation of our work, we have prepared 
now heterodinuclear and heterobridged complexes con- 
taining the ‘Rh”‘(C,F,)3’ moiety. We have used as 
starting materials either complexes with an acidic pro- 
ton (N-H), reacting with methoxo or acetylacetonate 
complexes, or the dihydroxo derivative [P(CH,Ph)- 
Ph,],[{Rh(C,F,),),( p-OH),] [lo] in which one or both 
of the hydroxo groups can be substituted by other 
anionic ligands. Here we describe the synthesis of an- 
ionic heterodinuclear, homo- and hetero-bridged com- 
pounds in which the fragment ‘Rh”‘(C6F,),’ is bonded 
to Rh’, Ir’ or Pd” moieties, and rhodium(II1) homodinu-

2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Dinuclear Rh”‘-Rh’ and Rh”‘-Ir’ (chloro)(py- 
razolatej-bridged complexes 
The acidic N-H group of the pyrazole ligand in the 
compound (PBzPh,)[Rh(C,F,),Cl(Hpz)] (Hpz = 
pyrazole, C,H,$) [71 is capable of reacting with the methoxo-bridged rhodium or iridium dimers [M,( w- 
0Me),(n4-diolefin),], or with acetylacetonate com- 
plexes, to give heterobridged compounds. For example, 
the complexes [PBzPh,][(C,FJ,Rh( /J.-Cl>( p-pz)M(n4- 
diolefin)] [M = Rh, diolefin = cycle-octa-1,5-diene, 
COD (1) or tetrafluorobenzobarrelene, TFB (2); M = Ir, 
diolefin = COD (311 are formed by addition of a stoi- 
chiometric amount of [PBzPh,][Rh(C,F,),Cl(Hpz)] to 
suspensions of the dimers in acetone (Scheme 1). When 
carbon monoxide is bubbled through dichloromethane 
solutions of 1 or 2, the displacement of the diolefin has 
been observed in solution but only mixtures of com-

pounds which cannot be totally identified are isolated 
from the oily residue. However, the complex [PBzPh,]- 
[(C,F,),Rh( p-Cl)( /..L-pzNh(CO),l (4) is prepared by 
the reaction of the Rh’ compound [Rh(acac)(CO),] with 
the Rh’u complex [PB~P~,][R~(C,F,),C~(H~Z)] (Scheme 
1). 
Deprotonation of the pyrazole ligand and formation 
of the heterobridged dinuclear complexes takes place 
under very mild conditions (room temperature). The 
reactions are faster with the methoxo compound than 
with the acetylacetonato complex, consistent with the 
basic behaviour of both groups. Under similar condi- 
tions, the reactions of [PBzPh,][Rh(C,F,),Cl(Hdmpz)] 
(Hdmpz = 3,5-d imethylpyrazole) with [Rh,( p-OMe),- 
(q4-diolefin),] did not lead to the expected hetero- 
bridged complexes. Instead, redistribution reactions took 
place to give the known products [PBzPh,],[{Rh(C,- 
F5j3( ~-C1)]2] [7] and [Rh,( ~-dmpz),(~4-diolefin),] [l 11 
which were separated by fractional crystallization and 
identified by analytical and spectroscopic data. 
Analytical results (C, H and N), reactions yields, 
colours and conductivities for the new complexes are 
listed in Table 1. Complexes l-4 are stable in air in the 
solid state but in solution they decompose within a few 
minutes. They ate soluble in common organic solvents 
but not soluble in hexane. Their conductivities in ace- 
tone solution are those expected for electrolytic dinu- 
clear 1: 1 complexes [ 121. The IR spectra of the com- 
plexes show the characteristic bands of the pentafluo- 
rophenyl group [ 131 and the phosphonium cation, and 
no N-H absorption. Compound 4 in dichloromethane 
solution shows two bands in the carbonyl region, at 
2005 and 2090 cm-‘, which are expected for a cis-di- 
carbonyl [ 141. The ‘H NMR spectra of the complexes 
are in accordance with the proposed structure. The 
signals due to the hydrogen atoms of the pyrazolate 
groups are difficult to assign because they overlap with 
those of the phosphonium cations. In the related penta- coordinated complexes [8-101 containing the ‘Rh(C,- 
F,),’ unit, the F NMR spectra show time-averaged 
signals at ca. room temperature for the fluorine atoms of 
the pentafluorophenyl rings. On cooling the samples, 
the rotation or isomerization processes slow, yielding 
spectra with distinct signals for all (or most) of the 
fluorine atoms. 
2.2. Dim&ear Rh”‘-Rh’, Rh”‘-Ir’ and Rh”‘-Pd” 
bi-imidazolate-bridged complexes 
Homo- and hetero-dinuclear complexes with the bi- 
imidazolate dianion coordinated in a tetradentate man- 
ner have been obtained from the anionic complex 
[Rh(C,F,),(Hbim)]- (5). This compound is prepared by 
treatment of [Rh(C,F,),(acac)]- with 1 mol of H,bim. 
The spectroscopic data are consistent with complex 5 
containing bidentate Hbim- [ 151. The broad IR spec- 
trum, from 3000-2300 cm-’ indicates an N-H bond 
remaining in the coordinated monoanion. By reaction of 
5 with [M2( p-OMe),(n4-diolefin),] or [Pd(acac)(v3- 
C,H,)], the methoxo or acetylacetonato groups are 
displaced and the dinuclear complexes [PBzPh,][(C,- 
F,),Rh( CL-bim)M(L,)] [M = Rh, L, = COD (6) or TFB 
(7); M=Ir, L, =COD (8); M=Pd, L,= n3-C,H, 
(913 are formed (Scheme 2). The conductivity measure- 
ments, analytical, IR, NMR and mass spectra data (Ta- 
ble 1 and Experimental details) are consistent with the 
formulation of 6-9 as dinuclear complexes with the 
tetradentate bi-imidazole dianion coordinated to two 
metal atoms. The IR absorptions of the tetracoordinate 
him*- appear at 1410 and 1120 cm- ’ [ 161. The proton 
NMR spectra show the signals due to the diolefin 
ligands (6-S) or that of the ally1 group (9). 
However, the reaction of 5 with [Rh(acac)(CO),] 
gives complex [PBzPh,],[{(C,F,>,Rh( p-bim)Rh- 
(CO),],] (lo), for which the equivalent conductivity as 
well as the mass spectrum seem to point to a tetranu-

clear structure (n = 2). In the mass spectrum (FAB) of 
complex 10, peaks of the (M + PBzPh,)- and of the 
tetranuclear (M)- anion are evident. The equivalent 
conductivity at different concentrations (ranging from 
10e3 to lop5 equiv. 1 - ‘) of compound 10 gives a value 
of A in Onsager’s equation of -937, also indicating a 
2: 1 formulation. Furthermore, the IR spectrum in the 
solid state or in dichloromethane solution of this com- 
plex shows three strong absorptions v(C0) at 2090, 
2065 and 2030 cm-‘, which are consistent with the 
arrangement of the four carbonyl groups as shown 
below [17]. 
2.3. Homodinuclear Rh”‘- Rh”’ complexes 
When the hydroxo-bridged complex [PBzPh,],[{Rh- 
(C,F,),( P-OH)]~] is treated with azoles such as Hpz or H,bim, or with thiols, HSR, it yields homodinuclear 
bridged compounds [PBzPh,],[{Rh(C,F,),],( CL-OH)( p- 
L)] [L = pz (111, S’Bu (12) or SPh (13)] and 
[PBzPh,],[{Rh(C,F,),),( p-him)] (14) (Scheme 3). 
These reactions imply protonation of the hydroxo groups 
and replacement by CL-azolato or p-thiolate groups. 
When using the pyrazole or the thiols, only one of the 
hydroxo ligands is displaced, either if the reaction is 
carried out in 1 : 1 ratio or with an excess of the donor. 
For the H,bim, both hydroxo groups are replaced and 
the bi-imidazolate dianion is coordinated tetradentally to 
two rhodium atoms. 
2.4. Dinuclear Rh”‘-Pd” halogen-bridged complexes 
Neutral compounds with two halogens cis are good 
precursors for compounds of higher nuclearity [ 181 and 
so, when diethyl ether solutions containing the solvated 
species [Rh(C,F,),(Et,O),] are added to dichlorometh- 
ane solutions of [PdX,(COD)], the neutral dinuclear 
complexes [(C,F,),Rh( p-X),Pd(COD)] [X = Cl (15) 
or Br (16)] are obtained [Eq. (l)]. They were character- 
ized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic data.

3. Experimental details 
3.1. General considerations 
All reactions were carried out under dinitrogen at 
room temperature using Schlenk techniques. Solvents 
were dried by standard methods and distilled under 
dinitrogen prior to use. The starting materials, [Rh,( ,u- 
0Me),(n4-diolefin),], (diolefin = COD or TFB), 
[It-,( ~-OMe),(q4-COD),l [19], [Rh(acac)(CO),l 1201, 
[PBzPh,I[Rh(C,F,),Cl(Hpz)l, [PBzPh,I[Rh(C,F,),- 
(acacll, [Rh(C,F,),(OEt,),l [71 and [PBzPh,12[iRh(C6- 
F5&( p-OH),1 t 101 were prepared according to re- 
ported methods. 
3.2. Physical measurements 
IR spectra (4000-200 cm- ’ ) were recorded on a 
Perkin-Elmer 783 spectrophotometer using Nujol mulls 
between polyethylene sheets or in solution in NaCl 
cells. I H and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a 
Varian XL-200 spectrometer operating at 200.057 and 
188.220 MHz, respectively (in deuterochloroform, 
CDCl, or acetone-d,, HDA, as solvents); chemical 
shifts are relative to CFCl, and SiMe, as external 
references. Elemental analyses were carried out with a 
Perkin-Elmer 240C microanalyzer. Mass spectra were 
measured in a VG Autospec spectrometer operated in 
the negative mode for anionic species and in the posi- 
tive mode for neutral complexes. Ions were produced 
with the standard Cs+ gun at ca. 30 kV; 3-nitrobenzyl 
alcohol (NBA) was used as matrix. High-resolution 
FAB spectra were confirmed by the simulated isotopic 
pattern distribution.

and vacuum-dried.
