Abstract 
Ion-beam-analysis techniques are being used to provide an understanding of the nature of collision cascades, irradiation- 
induced phase changes, lattice location of solute atoms and defect-solute atom interactions in various zirconium alloys. In 
zirconium inter-metallic compounds, such as Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe, ZrFe?, and Zr,(Fe ,,Ni, _ ,), electron and ion irradiations have 
been used to obtain detailed information on the crystalline-to-amorphous transformation occurring during the irradiation. 
Transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) observations have provided information on the nature of the damage produced in 
individual cascades, the critical dose required for amorphization, and the critical temperature for amorphization. In a study 
on the electron-energy dependence of amorphization in Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and ZrCr, in situ high-voltage-electron-microscope 
investigations were combined with high-energy forward-elastic-recoil measurements to yield information on the threshold 
displacement energies for Zr and Fe or Cr in these lattices, as well as the role of secondary displacements of lattice atoms by 
recoil impurities (CO) at low electron energies. In Zr implanted with s6Fe ions and subsequently bombarded with jOAr ions 
at 723 K, subsequent secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry (SIMS) analyses were used to monitor the effect of irradiation on the 
migration of Fe in the Zr lattice. In addition, ion-channeling investigations have been used to determine the lattice sites of 
solute atoms in Zr as well as the details of the interaction between the solute atoms and the irradiation-produced defecti. 
1. Introduction 
Ion-beam-analysis techniques are well suited to provide 
information on various irradiation effects that occur in 
zirconium alloys during irradiation. These effects include 
irradiation-induced phase changes, irradiation-enhanced 
precipitation and defect-solute atom interactions. The 
above effects may play a significant role in affecting the 
deformation and corrosion behaviour of zirconium alloys 
in either calandria or pressure tubes in CANDU nuclear 
reactors. The behaviour of zirconium intermetallic com- 
pounds containing Fe, Cr. Ni or Nb is of particular interest 
since an irradiation-induced crystalline-to-amorphous 
transformation has been observed for Zr(Cr,Fe), and 
Zr,(Ni,Fel precipitates in Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4, see 
Refs. [l-4] for example. Zr-Nb-Fe precipitates may also 
be present in Zr-2SNb alloys used in pressure tubes in 
CANDU reactors. In addition, Fe controls self and substi- 
tutional diffusion in both a-Zr and the a-based zirconium

In the present paper the principal results of investiga- 
tions of collision cascades and irradiation-induced amor- 
phization of various zirconium intermetallic compounds 
during ion and electron irradiation will be summarized. 
Results will also be presented for determining the thresh- 
old displacement energies for the constituent atoms (in- 
cluding light element impurities) in Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and 
ZrCr,, as obtained from studies of the electron-energy 
dependence of amorphization in these intermetallic com- 
pounds, along with a determination of the concentration of 
the light element impurities from forward elastic-recoil 
measurements using 230 MeV 2WBi ions. An ion implanta 
tion and subsequent irradiation procedure, followed by a 
SIMS analysis has provided information on the trapping of 
migrating Fe atoms in Zr by irradiation-produced defects. 
The results of studies of ion-channeling investigations on 
the location of the lattice positions of Au and N atoms in 
Zr and the interaction between these solute atoms and the 
irradiation-produced defects will also be presented.

2. Experimental details 
The bulk phases of Zr,Fe, (orthorhombic), Zr,(Fe,- 
Ni , _ .) (orthorhombic), Zr, Fe (tetragonal), ZrFe, (cubic 
Laves phase), and ZrCr, (cubic Laves phase) were ob- 
tained by the appropriate heat treatments from arc melted 
alloys. Samples suitable for transmission-electron-mi- 
croscopy @‘EM), forward-elastic-recoil detection, ion 
channeling or secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) 
were obtained by a combination of spark cutting, mechani- 
cal polishing, and finally either chemical or electropolish- 
ing procedures. 
The heavy-ion bombardments were performed at Chalk 
River Laboratories (CRL) using one of the following: a 70 
kV ion implanter, a high-voltage mass separator or a 2.5 
MV Van de Graaff. Ion channeling investigations were 
performed using a 2.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator at 
CRL. Forward-elastic-recoil measurements were per- 
formed using 230 MeV 209Bi ions produced by the Tan- 
dem accelerator in the TASCC facility at CRL. The recoil- 
ing target atoms were detected in a specially designed 
A.&E detector [9]. The in situ electron bombardments 
were performed on the Kratos high-voltage electron micro- 
scope (HVEM) at Argonne National Laboratory. The SIMS 
analysis was performed using a CAMECA 4F at CAN- 
MET. Detailed electron-microscope observations (TEM) 
and EDX analyses were performed using a Philips CM30 
electron microscope at CRL. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Collision cascades and irradiation-induced amor- 
phization in zirconium intermetallic compounds 
A detailed TEM study has been performed of the 
damage produced in individual collision cascades by l5- 
350 keV 209Bi ion bombardments of Zr,Fe, ZrzFe and 
ZrFez [ IO,1 I]. Examples of the damage visible in the TEM are shown in Fig. 1. The majority of the damaged regions 
had diameters in the range 1.0 to 5.0 nm. 
At high values for the average deposited-energy density 
8” in the cascade, which corresponded to low energy 
heavy-ion implants (e.g. 15-30 keV Bi in Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe 
and ZrFe,) the visible damage produced in a cascade 
consisted of a single damaged region, as shown in Fig. la. 
& is a measure of the average amount of energy expended 
in nuclear collision events, that is deposited per atom in 
the volume occupied by an individual collision cascade 
[lo,1 I]. With decreasing values of & (i.e. increasing ion 
implant energies), there was an increasing tendency for 
multiple damaged regions (subcascades) to form within a 
main cascade, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The visible damaged 
regions appeared to be amorphous. It was also found that 
as the Bi ion energy increased (?, decreased), the fraction 
F of the theoretical collision cascade volume that was 
occupied by the visible damaged regions within a cascade 
decreased rapidly. The theoretical collision-cascade vol- 
ume was taken as the volume of the spheroid whose axes 
were determined by the longitudinal (AX 2)“2 and trans- 
verse (Y ‘)“* straggling components of the statistical 
damage distribution [ 12,131. The crystalline-to-amorphous 
transformation appeared to be the result of direct amor- 
phization within the collision cascades and a critical defect 
concentration being reached in the cascade overlap re- 
gions, thus producing additional amorphous regions. 
Detailed information has been obtained for irradiation- 
induced amorphization of Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe ZrFe,, ZrCr, and 
Zr, (Fe,,Ni, _,) alloys during irradiation with heavy ions 
[10,11,14--163 (i.e. 0.5-1.5 MeV “OAr ions and 0.015-1.5 
MeV 209Bi ions) and with electrons (0.2-0.9 MeV) in a 
high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM) [ 17-201. It was 
found that the critical temperature (i.e. the temperature 
above which amorphization does not occur) for amorphiza- 
tion with electrons was always considerably lower than 
under heavy-ion bombardment. Depending upon the partic- 
ular intermetahic compound, the critical temperatures for 
electron irradiation were in the range 5 75 to 250 K,

whereas the critical temperatures for heavy-ion irradiation most independent of the temperature: the damage accumu- 
were - 500-600 K. Also, in the vicinity of the critical lates in the lattice, unchecked by thermal annealing. At a 
temperature for the electron irradiations there was a signif- certain level of irradiation damage, there appears to be a 
icant dose-rate dependence, with the highest critical tem- driving force to exchange the imperfect form of long-range

temperature regimes where significant annealing of defects The difference between the ion and electron irradiations 
was occurring. In Zr,Fe, for example, in the temperature results from the fact that ion irradiation produces displace- 
range 160-280 K there was a pronounced dose-rate effect 
for OS-l.5 MeV “OAr ion irradiations. The fraction of the ment cascades, while electron irradiation produces isolated 
Frenkel pairs. Within the cascades, the density of damage 
irradiated volume that had been rendered amorphous at a 
given “OAr ion fluence increased noticeably as the ion flux is quite high and amorphization can then occur either 
directly in the cascade or upon cascade overlap. As the 
was increased from 0.9 X 10” to 14.7 X 10” irradiation temperature increases, annealing processes are 
ions cmm2 s- ’ 11.51. Near the critical temperature, as the activated that offset the production of damage. When 
dose rate increases there is less chance for annealing to annealing reduces the effective damage rate without over- 
occur before the next damage event, and thus it is easier to 
amorphize the material. Also, for the @Ar and 209Bi ion whelming it, a “step” appears in the dose-to-amorphiza- 
tion vs. temperature curve, increasing the dose-to-amorphi- 
irradiations of Zr,Fe, a step occurred in the dose-to- zation at that temperature. The temperature at which the 
amorphization curve in the same temperature region activated annealing process completely overwhelms dam- 
(- 180-220 K) as that for the critical temperature for age production is the critical temperature, and amorphiza-

temperature than at a higher damage rate. This implies

In the case of the ZrFe, and ZrCr, intermetallic com- 
pounds (both having a cubic Laves structure), the morphol- 
ogy of the alloys was such that there were two distinct 
regions of the same ZrFe, or ZrCr, phases; one of which 
contained a high density of stacking faults and the other 
containing a low density of stacking faults. For both ZrFe, 
and ZrCr,, the critical temperatures for electron irradiation 
were higher for the regions containing the high density 
stacking faults than they were for the low density stacking 
fault regions; a difference of _ 20 K for ZrFe, and - 10 
K for ZrCr, 1201. Also, in ZrFe, the electron dose required 
for amorphization to occur at the lowest irradiation temper- 
atures (25-35 K) was _ 2 times lower for the high density 
stacking-fault regions than it was for the low density 
stacking-fault regions. Regions containing stacking faults 
are high-energy regions and the local distortion of the 
lattice or high chemical energy gives an additional contri- 
bution to the free energy rise resulting from irradiation, 
thus facilitating the crystalline-to-amorphous transforma- 
tion. Also, there could be a change in defect mobility or 
possibly a change in diffusion modes caused by the pres- 
ence of the stacking faults. 3.2. Electron-energy dependence of amorphization in 
Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and ZrCr,, and the determination of the 
threshold displacement energies for the atoms in these 
compounds 
The results of the ion and electron irradiations can be 
understood in the framework of damage accumulation 
under irradiation. Damage produced by irradiation is op- 
posed by thermal annealing. The balance between the rate 
of damage production and the ability of the material to 
repair itself dictates the response of the material to inadia- 
tion. At low temperatures, damage produced by irradiation 
remains “frozen in”, with little annealing taking place. In 
this temperature regime, the dose-to-amorphization is al- Studies were also undertaken to determine the energy 
dependence of the dose-to-amorphization during electron 
irradiation of Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and ZrCr, at 23-30 K [ 18-201. 
Samples from these alloys were irradiated in the HVEM at 
ANL at energies from 200 to 900 keV. The irradiations 
were performed at very low temperatures (23-30 K) in 
order to eliminate any dose-rate effects on the dose-to- 
amorphization. Amorphization occurred in these alloys at 
energies from 900 down to - 300 keV. The results for the 
three alloys are shown in Fig. 2. Three distinct regions can 
be observed in Fig. 2. Between 900 and _ 700 keV 
amorphization occurred at the lowest dose, which was 
relatively constant. A higher plateau of dose-to-amorphiza- 
tion was then present; at 500-600 K for Zr,Fe, 400-500 
K for Zr,Fe and 550-600 K for ZrCr,. Finally, there was 
a sharp increase in the dose-to-amorphization below the 
plateau regions. 
The results of the energy dependence experiments can 
be analyzed in terms of a composite displacement cross 
section dominated at high energies (_ 700-900 keV) by 
displacements of Zr and Fe (or Cr) atoms, by displace- 
ments of Fe (or Cr) at intermediate energies (- 400-600 
keV) and by secondary displacements of lattice atoms by 
recoil impurities at low energies (below 400 keV).

element impurities present in the samples, forward-elastic- 
recoil measurements using 230 MeV 2wBi ions were 
performed. The recoiling target atoms were detected in a 
specially designed A E-E detector [9]. This technique also 
enabled us to determine the depth distribution of the light 
element impurities over a depth that was comparable to 
that used for HVEM examinations (i.e. N 200-350 nm), 
or up to N 1000 nm for the 0.5-l 5 MeV 40Ar ion 
irradiations. 
A typical example of a coincidence AE-E spectra is 
shown in Fig. 3 for one of the zirconium intermetallic 
compounds. It can be seen that the principal light element 
impurities are 0 and C. The results, for the various alloys 
used in the present investigations, indicate that near the 
surface region (< - 25 nm), the 0 and C levels are 
_ 4-10 atom 8 and N l-3 atom % respectively. Below 
this surface region in the bulk of the specimen the 0 and C 
levels range from _ 0.5-2.0 atom % and - 0.25-1.0 
atom %, respectively. 
For these low temperature electron irradiations per- 
formed on Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and ZrCr,, annealing of the 
irradiation-produced defects is not a factor, and therefore 
there is no dose rate effect, as observed experimentally. 
Amorphization occurs when the dose-to-amorphization is 
equal to the critical dose Dcrit, i.e. at a constant dpa, which 
is specific for each inter-metallic compound. Consequently.

tron flux, f is the measured time-to-amorphization, .Y, is 
the concentration of element i, ahi (EA, E) is the displace- 
ment cross section, I?; is the displacement threshold en- 
ergy and Q,,, is the critical dose for amorphization. Eq. 
(I) states that when we multiply the values of the dose-to- 
amorphization as a function of energy (as given in Fig. 2. 
for example), by the weighted displacement cross section 
(obtained from the tabulations by Oen [21]), the result 
should be independent of energy. Since the values from 
Oen’s tables [2l] are dependent on the displacement en- 
ergy, it is possible to find the set of displacement energies 
that best fits the experimental data. 
As mentioned above, displacements can also occur by a 
secondary displacement mechanism, mediated by light ele- 
ment impurities. The forward-elastic-recoil measurements 
show that 0 is the major light element impurity in the 
zirconium intermetallic compounds used in this investiga- 
tion. Hence, if the displacements produced by a secondary 
displacement mechanism are also taken into account, then:

has been possible to obtain the specific values for the 
displacement threshold energies for the atoms on the sub- 
lattices in these compounds, as well as to assess the 
importance of secondary displacement events produced by 
light element impurities. 
3.3. Trapping of Fe by irradiation-produced defects in Zr 
In order to investigate the effect of irradiation on the 
trapping of Fe by irradiation-produced defects in Zr, ion 
implantations have been combined with a SIMS analysis 
of the implanted Fe depth profile. Initially two Zr single 
crystals were implanted at 35 K with 1 .O MeV 56Fe ions to 
a fluence of 2.5 X lOI ions cm -*. Subsequent ion implan- 
tations of the two crystals were performed at 723 K with 
0.9 MeV “OAr ions to fluences of either 5.0 X lOI or 
5.0 x 10 I5 “OAr ions cme2. During the “OAr ion bombard- 
ment, one-half of each crystal was masked to serve as an 
unirradiated reference where only thermal annealing oc- 
curred. The energy of the “OAr ion beam (i.e. 0.9 MeV) 
was chosen so that the damage distribution produced by 
the “OAr ions was similar to the range profile of the 
implanted 1.0 MeV 56Fe ions. 
The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In the absence 
of the “OAr ion irradiation at 723 K, appreciable migration

of the Fe atoms has occurred (see points labelled 56Fe 
implant + 723 K anneal). This is consistent with various 
diffusion results which indicate that Fe is a very fast 
diffusing species in Zr [5,6]. In the presence of the irradia- 
tion damage produced by the @Ar ions at 723 K, the Fe 
atoms become trapped by the irradiation-produced defects. 
Consistent with this interpretation, is the fact that the 
trapping effect is noticeably larger for the higher fluence 
of “OAr ions. 
Zou et al. [22] have combined ion implantation and 
electron microprobe analysis to study irradiation effects on 
Fe distributions in Zircaloy-2 and Zr-2SNb. They irradi- 
ated large-grained (lo-40 m) Zircaloy-2 and Zr-2SNb 
specimens with 1.5 MeV db” Ar ions to fluences of - lOI 
ions cm - * at 323, 573 and 693 K. Subsequent electron 
microprobe analyses revealed that the “OAr ion irradiations 
lead to enhanced dissolution of Fe in the a-phase. After 
irradiation, the a-phase Fe levels were 0.025-0.15 at.% 
compared to equivalent values of - 0.0070 at.% in the 
non-irradiated state. In Zr-2.5Nb the P-phase Fe levels 
fell from about 0.60 to 0.35 at.%. Zou et al. [22] propose 
that the irradiation-driven dissolution of Fe into the a-phase 
of Zircaloy-2 and Zr-2.5Nb can be understood in terms of 
irradiation-induced defects and Fe-defect interactions. 
3.4. Location of the lattice positions of Au and N atoms in 
Zr and the interaction between these solute atoms and the 
irradiation-produced defects 
Backscattering of 2.0 MeV 4He ions from Zr-0.2 at.% 
Au and Zr-0.3 at.% Au crystals were measured for [OOOl], 
(1120) and (lOiO> directions and the (0001) plane in 
order to determine the trapping characteristics of Au atoms 
for irradiation-induced defects [23]. It was observed that 
the Au atoms, which were initially on substitutional sites, formed strong traps for Zr self-interstitial atoms, which 
became mobile at - 120 K. The direction of the Au atom 
displacements in the trapped configuration was between 
the (40?3) and (lOi0) axes. The displacement of the Au 
was reduced during annealing from 200-400 K, and was 
reduced further from 550-700 K. The recovery stage at 
550-700 K is likely due to vacancies. It was initially 
proposed that the recovery stage at 200-400 K may be due 
to another type of Zr self-interstitial atom. However, it is 
now believed that interstitial Fe-vacancy (Fe,V) com- 
plexes are very strongly bound ( - 1.4 eV> and also that 
they have very low migration energies [24,25]. Hence, it is 
quite possible that the recovery occurring at 200-400 K, 
may be the result of the migration of a Fe,V complex 
(since the Zr crystals will undoubtedly have Fe present as 
an impurity), or to the migration of a Au,V complex. 
Ion-channeling techniques were also used to determine 
the lattice sites of N in the a-Zr hexagonal close-packed 
(hcp) structure and the effect of trapping irradiation-pro- 
duced defects at the N atoms [26]. A Zr single crystal was 
implanted along ( 1 150) at 293 K with 300 keV 15N2 ions 
to a fluence of 2.2 X lOI ionscm-*. The position of “N 
atoms in the Zr lattice was studied using measurements of 
yields of ‘H ions (incident energy 800 keV) backscattered 
from the Zr atoms and the alpha-particle yields from the 
nuclear reaction ‘5N(p,~)‘2C. Dechanneling of the protons 
in the Zr crystal provided information on changes in the 
overall defect concentration during the irradiation and 
annealing stages. 
Information was obtained for the (1120) and ( lOTO> 
channels. The “N ion implantation resulted in an apprecia- 
bly larger yield of Q particles when the ‘H ion beam was 
incident along (1120) compared to that found for inci- 
dence along (lOiO>. Angular scans through (1120) also 
indicated an appreciable peaking in the a-particle yield at 
L.M. Howe et ul./Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B 118 (1996) 443-669 669 
the aligned ( 1120) position. These observations indicated 
that the N atoms occupied the octahedral interstitial posi- 
tions in the a-23 hcp lattice. 
Subsequent to the “N implantation, the Zr crystal was 
irradiated at 35 K with 800 keV 4He ions to fluences of 
1.8 X lOI and 9.1 X 1Or6 ionscm-*, followed by post- 
irradiation annealing in both instances. No appreciable 
displacement of the N atoms from their lattice sites was 
detected after these irradiations, or during annealing up to 
423 K. Hence N atoms in octahedral sites are very stable 
and their position remains essentially unaltered during 
subsequent defect formation and migration, at least up to 
423 K. 
4. Conclusions 
Ion and electron irradiations, ion implantation and vari- 
ous ion-beam analyses have provided the following infor- 
mation on irradiation damage in zirconium alloys: 
1) Detailed information on the nature of the damage pro- 
duced in individual collision cascades in Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe 
and ZrFe,. 
2) An understanding of the mechanisms controlling irradi- 
ation-induced amorphization in various zirconium inter- 
metallic compounds. 
3) Values of the threshold displacement energies for the 
constituent atoms (including light element impurities) 
in Zr,Fe, Zr,Fe and ZrCr,. 
4) Trapping of migrating Fe atoms in Zr by irradiation- 
produced defects. 
5) Location of the lattice position of Au and N atoms in 
Zr and the interaction between these solute atoms and 
the irradiation-produced defects.
