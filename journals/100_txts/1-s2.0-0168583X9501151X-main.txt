Abstract 
A necessary condition for etching of particle tracks in polymers is the selective removal of molecular fragments formed 
along the ion path. Until recently it was assumed that solvent induced track sensitization by N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) 
in poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) removes oligomers from the track core exclusively via a dissolution process. The 
present study shows that degradation products of DMF, in particular amines, are also involved in the sensitization process. 
For this purpose, the chemical interaction of amines with heavy ion irradiated PET was examined by various techniques. It 
was shown that amines induce a selective track “pre-etching”. Compared with pure DMF, the track etching rate increases 
with amine concentration. 
1. Introduction 
Heavy ion tracks in polymers consist of an amorphous 
phase in the form of a cylindrical damage zone. Due to 
their increased chemical reactivity, ion tracks can be at- 
tacked by selective etching. Using a suitable etchant the 
modified material in the track can be dissolved at a much 
higher rate than the non-damaged matrix. This technique 
has been used for many years and makes possible a wide 
range of scientific and technical applications [ 1,2]. The 
effect of solvent induced track sensitization has been known 
since 1990 131. Tracks in poly(ethyleneterephthalate1 (PET) 
showed an increased etching rate after being treated with 
an organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). 
Until now, this effect was exclusively attributed to swelling, 
to recrystallisation, and to the extraction of oligomers 
[4-81. 
Etching of tracks in PET is usually performed in aque- 
ous NaOH (3-6M) at temperatures between 30 and 70°C. 
whereby the polymer is decomposed by alkaline hydrolysis 
as shown in Fig. 1. 
However, it is also known that PET can be degraded in 
non-aqueous systems by aminolysis reactions (Fig. 2). We 
assume that this aminolysis reaction is also involved in the 
sensitization process. Amines are produced when DMF 
degrades under the influence of light and water (e.g., 
atmospheric) (Fig. 3) and therefore always exists as a 
spurious impurity in DMF. 
Here we report on studies using the techniques of UV

raphy, electric conductance, and chemical etching in order 
to test the influence of amines on the process of track 
sensitization. 
2. Irradiation 
Commercial PET films from Hoechst (type RN 23) 
with an average thickness of 23 pm were irradiated with 
Xe ions at a specific energy of 11.4 MeV/u. For extrac- 
tion experiments the applied fluence was 10” ions/cm2. 
For sensitization and etching experiments the ion fluence 
was 3 X lo8 ions/cm2. 
3. Experimental and results 
3.1. Spectroscopy and chromatography 
To investigate the influence of amines (methylamine 
and propylamine, from Aldrich-Chemie) on track sensitiza- 
tion, defined quantities were added to DMF (Merck) vary- 
ing the concentration from 0 to 6 ~01%. For spectroscopic 
measurements we use the homologue propylamine as model 
substance instead of gaseous methylamine. 
100 mg of the irradiated PET films were extracted 
during 48 h (T= 25°C) under shaking in the DMF/amine 
solutions. The extracts were examined by the following 
standard methods for characterizing chemical compounds: 
1. UV spectroscopy using a Lambda 15 spectrometer (Per- 
kin-Elmer) in the wavelength range 280-450 nm (step 
width 1 nm, recording speed 120 nm/min).

Fluorescence spectroscopy with a double beam spec- 
trometer (Fluorolog, Spex) and a single photon count- 
ing device. All monochromator slits were set to 3 nm. 
The spectra were calibrated with a rhodamine B solu- 
tion (3 g/l in glycerine). 
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a stan- 
dard chromatograph (Waters Inc.) which consist of UV, 
fluorescence and refractive sensors. Polystyrene stan- 
dards ( h4, = 500-600 Ooo g/mol, MJM,, 5 1. I ) were 
used for calibration. The sample volume was 90 l_~l at a 
flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and with tetrahydrofuran as 
eluant. 
It was found that the total amount of extracts increased 
a function of the concentration of propylamine in pure 
DMF (Fig. 4). The observed absorbance at a wavelength 
below 400 nm indicates the existence of radiolysis prod- 
ucts [5,9]. The recorded GPC signal corresponds to masses 
lower than 500 g/mol and to the peak of the solvent. 
Masses higher than 500 g/mol were not observed. 
Fluorescence spectra were recorded at an excitation 
wavelength of 386 nm and at an emission wavelength of 
420 nm (Fig. 5). They indicate that the radiolysis products 
caused by ion irradiation are very similar to those gener- 
ated by photodegradation [lo- 121. 
Surnmarising the results obtained by GPC, UV and 
fluorescence spectroscopy, it is evident that the amount of 
irradiation products in the extracts is strongly correlated 
with the concentration of amine in DMF. 
Mass spectrometry was performed with a mass spec- 
trometer coupled to a gas chromatograph (Hewlett- 
Packard). The chromatography was carried out with he- 
lium at a column temperature of 150°C in order to avoid 
thermal degradation. In the spectra, the following masses 
were identified: M = 327 g/mol, M = 251 g/mok, and

with pure DMF, with DMF/3% propylamine, and with 
DMF/lO% propylamine, respectively. They are attributed 
to the chemical compounds shown in Fig. 6. It is interest- 
ing to note that the same compounds are observed as 
degradation products (amides) of polyester during aminol- 
ysis. The substance corresponding to M = 327 g/mol 
found in the extract of pure DMF provides evidence for 
the degradation of PET by amines as impurities of DMF. 
3.2. Permeation 
In another experiment, we studied the permeation of 
solvent through the ion tracks using a conductivity cell. An 
irradiated PET foil separates two chambers filled with 
DMF/methylamine/water solution as sensitization and 
conducting medium. During the sensitization process the 
electrical current through the cell was continuously moni- 
tored. The instant when the sensitization medium com- 
pletely penetrates through the tracks (breakthrough time 
to) is characterised by a dramatic increase of the electric 
current. The sensitization rate K is defined as 
K = t,/2d,

Fig. 7 shows the breakthrough time as a function of the 
amine concentration in DMF. The breakthrough time of 
the solvent decreases exponentially with increasing amine 
concentration. The process of permeation can be described 
by a first-order reaction with respect to the sensitization 
medium.

function of the inverse temperature an activation energy of

The linear dependence confirms that the sensitization is a 
first-order reaction. 
3.3. Track etching 
Etching experiments were performed to investigate the 
influence of the amine concentration in DMF on the pore 
growth of etched tracks. After sensitization in DMF/lO% 
water and in DMF/IO% water with methylamine (2.1 
mol/l) as additive, the polymer foils were etched in a 5M 
sodium hydroxide solution (4OT, 30 min). The pore diam- 
eter was determined using a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM). Etched tracks which were sensitized in a 
DMF/water/amine solution showed larger pore diameters

than etched tracks sensitized in a pure DMF/water mix- 
ture (Fig. 9). The etched surface of the amine sensitized 
polymer was much rougher than the DMF sensitized film. 
4. Summary 
The influence of amine concentration in DMF as a 
sensitizer for track etching has been investigated by vari- 
ous techniques. All experiments clearly show that amines 
either as impurities or as an additive to N,N-dimethylfor- 
mamide play an important role in the sensitization process. 
The UV and fluorescence spectra provide evidence that the 
treatment with DMF and amines dissolves the radiolysis 
products in the ion tracks. The spectroscopic properties of 
these products are very similar to those generated by the 
photolysis of PET (Figs. 4-6) [8-IO]. The aminolysis of 
irradiated PET produces molecules with a weight lower 
than 500 g/mol (GPC), whereby some of them could be 
identified by mass spectrometry. The reaction products 
identified after sensitization of irradiated PET in pure 
DMF indicated that methylamine as a degradation product 
of DMF influences the sensitization process. These results 
show that some of the chemical reactions occurring during 
“solvent induced track sensitization” are similar to rele- 
vant processes during etching in sodium hydroxide, such 
as alkaline hydrolysis [ 13- 151. 
Permeation experiments indicated that, with increasing 
concentration of amines in DMF, the sensitization process 
was accelerated. The first-order reaction explains the ob- 
servation that the sensitization time only depended on the 
concentration of amines in the DMF. From the large 
difference in pore diameters of the etched tracks, sensitized 
in a DMF/water/amine solution or in an amine-free solution, we conclude that amines support the sensitization 
process of ion tracks.
