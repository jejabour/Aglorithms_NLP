Abstract 
We have investigated the modification of high-T, superconducting film structures due to ion beam irradiation using a 
mask technology. The YBa,Cu,O, (YBCO) and GdBa,CusO, (GBCO) thin film microbridges were covered with electron 
resist (PMMA) masks. Then, a submicron slit was patterned by e-beam lithography. The high-T, bridges were modified by 
irradiation with argon ions. Fluence and energy of the ions could be varied and the change in the electrical properties of the 
modified regions have been measured. For suitable values of ion energy and fluence we measured Shapiro steps in the 
current-voltage cumes under microwave irradiation for a temperature range of a few Kelvin just below the critical 
temperature. We found a modulation of the Shapiro steps with increasing microwave power and compared the power 
dependence to Josephson and flux flow behaviour. The Monte-Carlo program TRIM was used for characterization of the ion 
solid interaction, especially for the estimation of range, damage distribution and straggling in dependence on geometry. 
1. Introduction 
Since the discovery of high temperature superconduc- 
tivity great efforts have been done to apply these materials 
in thin film cryoelectronic devices based on the Josephson 
effect, e.g. superconducting quantum interference devices 
(SQUIDS) or active microwave circuits [1,2]. There is a 
great variety of different types of high-T, Josephson junc- 
tions like grain boundary junctions, barrier junctions, mod- 
ified bridges and intrinsic stack junctions, see e.g. in Ref. 
[3]. For cryoelectronic applications a high stability in time 
of a junction is requested. Until now, the most stable 
junction which is known is the grain boundary type. 
However the fabrication of well defined junctions with 
high stability in time is still difficult and relatively expen- 
sive. Thus, there is a rising interest in alternative types of 
high-T, Josephson junctions, which avoid these drawbacks 
and have advantages for higher level of integration for 
complex cryoelectronic circuits. 
For preparation of stable junctions we generated a 
disturbance of nanometer dimensions in a microbridge of 
some micron width using ion beam technology. This tech- 
nology is well known and high sophisticated because of its

microstructure branches, e.g. micromechanics. In earlier 
work we used the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technology for 
fabrication of Josephson junctions and SQUIDS [4,5]. 
We found similar results to Zani et al. [6] and Gheem et 
al. [7] who both used the FIB to irradiate the high-T, 
bridges and found after ion irradiation Josephson-like be- 
haviour as well as SQUID modulation. 
In this work we present the results of broad ion beam 
modification by using a mask with a thin slit perpendicular 
to the microbridge, as a technique which is comparable to 
standard circuit fabrication in semiconductor industry. 
In contrast to Tinchev and Hinken [8,9] we used thinner 
high-& films, smaller slit width, another ion species and 
lower ion energies. In order to estimate the optimal mask 
thickness and optimal irradiation parameters for the prepa- 
ration of weak-links acting as Josephson barriers in the 
high-T, films we applied the Monte Carlo program TRIM, 
developed by Ziegler et al. and Biersack et al. [IO-121. 
2. Principle 
The aim of our investigations consists in the fabrication 
of a thin barrier which acts as a superconducting weak 
link. This barrier is formed by ion beam irradiation through 
a submicron slit in a mask. The damaged region in the

underlying superconducting film of submicron dimension 
in lateral as well as in longitudinal (thickness) directions, 
forms a superconducting weak link. The principle of the 
submicron ion beam modification with a broad Ar+ beam 
is shown in Fig. 1. In order to observe Josephson-like 
behaviour in such a weak link, the spatial extension of the 
irradiated region should be limited to a short modified 
region, because the effective length should be less than the 
normal conducting coherence length of the modified mate- 
rial, assuming proximity effect coupling [9,13]. But we do 
not know the coupling length of the modified high-T, 
material. Even if this is much larger than the very short 
superconducting coherence length in the high-T, materials 
it seems to be properly to make the irradiated region as 
short as possible [ 131. Tinchev used an oxygen ion beam of 
100 keV energy and a slit mask of 300 nm line width. The 
YBCO film thickness he varied between 200-300 nm and 
the ion fluence between 1 X 10’3/cm2 and 6 X 10’3/cm2 
t91. 
Starting from these empirical results we have carried 
out additional calculations and experiments to clear up the 
following questions: 
1) Which ion energy is necessary to modify the super- 
conducting film completely, without any residual super- 
conducting shunt nearby the substrate? 
2) What thickness of the PMMA film mask is neces- 
sary to protect the underlying high-T, film? 
3) What is the optimum electron dose for realization of 
a slit of minimum line width in a PMMA film of a given 
thickness? 
4) Which effect will have the variation of irradiation 
parameters, as ion mass and energy, on the extension and 
shape of the modified region in the superconducting film? 
For reducing the thickness of the modified region we 
can make the line in the mask thinner and reduce the 
straggling effect of the ions by using heavier ions or lower 
energies. The last two points will have a negative effect on 
the ion range. In order to minimize the probability for 
occurring of a residual superconducting shunt we can 
reduce the thickness of the high-T, film. But this is still 
limited by the quality (critical current density, critical 
temperature) and homogeneity of the superconducting 
films. The investigations in this work are concentrated on theoretical simulations and experiments for a first attempt 
in optimization of this complex of problems. 
3. Experimental 
For the experiments we used YBa,Cu,O, (YBCO) and 
GdBa,Cu,O, (GBCO) films of a thickness between 80 
and 100 nm. The films were produced by dc magnetron 
sputtering in Ar/O, atmosphere at a total pressure of 27 
Pa. We used c-axis oriented films on SrTiO, substrates. 
Microbridges of 3, 6, 12 and 24 km width and length of 
24 pm were patterned using a standard photolithography 
method. In a next step the films were covered by a PMMA 
resist of a thickness of approximately 1 km. A small slit of 
about 150 nm width was produced into the PMMA resist 
across the microbridge by means of e-beam lithography. 
The samples - prepared in this way - were irradiated with 
Ar ions of energies between 50 and 100 keV and ion 
fluences between 1 X lOI* and 1 X lOI cm-* in a next 
step. In order to avoid a channeling effect we tilted the 
sample by 7” deviating the c-axis of the film from the 
direction of the ion beam. 
The superconducting film under the slit was modified 
by the ion beam whereas the other area was protected 
against radiation by the mask. The modification of the 
high-T, film was investigated by measuring the depen- 
dence of electrical resistance on temperature (R-T curves) 
and the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) in a 
closed cycle refrigerator cryostat and also in liquid helium 
with a common four point method. For investigation of the 
Josephson effect the samples were irradiated by mi- 
crowave radiation in the frequency range of 10 to 20 GHz. 
4. Results and diicussion 
4.1. Line width of the PMMA mask 
The thickness of the PMMA layer has to be larger than 
the projected range of the ions in order to protect the 
high-?; film outside the slit. For estimation of the ion 
range in the PMMA film we have employed the TRIM 95 
program [lo]. The results are given in Table 1. The ion

energy for Ar ions in a PMMA film of 1 pm thickness 
should not be higher than 650 keV. Thus we are confident 
that for the energies in our experiments of 50 and 100 keV 
and the PMMA thickness of about 1 pm nearly no ion will 
reach the underlying high-T, film, or it losts so much 
energy that it will not be able to destroy the superconduct- 
ing film considerably. 
The dimension of the modified region is important for 
the electrical properties of the Josephson junction. One 
way to reduce the thickness of the barrier consists in 
reducing the line width in the PMMA mask. Fig. 2 shows 
the line width in the PMMA film made by e-lithography in 
dependence on the electron dose. It can be seen that the 
line width is increasing with electron dose. To produce a 
very small line it will be favourable to use lower electron

doses. However, the electron dose for our mask material 
should not be lower than about 1500 pC/cm’ in order to 
ensure a complete remove of the developed area of the 
resist. Furthermore, the PMMA film thickness has an 
influence on the minimum line width (Fig. 3). With de- 
creasing thickness the minimum line width is decreasing, 
but below a thickness of approximately 150 nm for Ar ions 
with an incident energy of 100 keV (see Table 1) the 
protection of the superconductor against energetic ions is 
incompletely. Therefore, we had to find a satisfying com- 
promise between ion range in the mask, PMMA thickness 
and the electron dose to produce a small line in the PMMA 
on the one hand and the ion range in the superconducting 
film and its film thickness on the other hand. As an 
example, we used Ar ions with energies lower than 100 
keV and a PMMA thickness of about 1 km_ To pattern 
slits between 100 and 250 nm we used electron doses 
between 1500 and 3500 pC/cm2. Fig. 4 shows an elec- 
tron microscopic picture @EM) of a typical PMMA film 
with a line width of 190 nm. 
4.2. TRIM simulation and ion beam irradiation 
The electrical behaviour of the junctions is caused by 
the barrier produced by ion beam modification. As ion 
species for irradiation we prefered to apply noble gas ions, 
in this case argon, because it will have nearly no effect on 
chemical composition of the high-T, film. Thus, the ion 
beam damage in the solid will be the dominant process of 
modification and we can neglect doping by implantation as 
well as ion beam sputtering at the low values for ion 
fluence. Additionally, as discussed in Section 4.1, the selection of suitable irradiation parameters is necessary to 
reduce the thickness of the barrier. The lateral range and 
straggling of the ions under the edge of the slit in the mask 
increases the thickness of the barrier in excess of the slit 
width. For a first quantitative estimation we carried out 
TRIM calculations with the version TRIM 95 [lo-121 for 
a number of 10000 ions for each different input parameter. 
The TRIM program is normally used for calculation of ion 
solid interaction in amorphous bulk materials or films. The 
application of TRIM to epitaxial films seems to be permit- 
ted because the direction of incident ion beam is tilted 
from the c-axis orientation by 7” in order to avoid a 
channeling effect, thus we can neglect the crystal structure 
in a first approximation. 
Fig. 5 shows the lateral projected range of the ions in 
dependence on the depth in the YBCO film with a thick- 
ness of 300 nm and a theoretical mass density of 6.33 
g/cm3. The lateral projected range is defined as the 
distance under the mask where the concentration drops to 
25% (at the mask edge the concentration is equal to 50% 
of the uniform value) [lo]. The first two curves are calcu- 
lated for argon ions (50 and 100 keV) and the third one for 
oxygen ions (100 keV) with the parameters used by Tinchev 
and Hinken [8,9]. As it can be seen in Fig. 5 the lateral 
projected range is shorter for the heavier argon ions than 
for oxygen ions at the same energy of 100 keV and is also 
shorter for argon ions with the lower energy of 50 keV. 
The same situation can be observed for the lateral pro- 
jected straggling (Table 1). Thus we can conclude, to 
achieve a thinner barrier the ions should be relatively 
heavy and have a low incident energy. However this is 
limited by the penetration depth of the ions, which has not

to be smaller than film thickness to exclude a supercon- 
ducting shunt. Therefore we have to consider longitudinal 
projected range and straggling. Fig. 6 shows the longitudi- 
nal projected range as a function of the depth in a YBCO 
film. It can be seen that the lower ion mass and the lower 
ion energy results in a shorter longitudinal range. This 
drawback we can compensate by lowering the film thick- 
ness. It shows also that special requests for the quality of 
high-T, films are growing from the limited penetration 
depth. These are for example: the homogeneity of the 
films, a constant and well known film thickness along the 
sample and from one sample to another, and a low rough- 
ness of the film surface. 
The average values for longitudinal range and strag- 
gling as well as lateral range and straggling are given 
Table 2. Using these results we can approximate the 
theoretical thickness of the barrier if we add up the experi- 
mental line width in the PMMA mask and 2 times the 
projected lateral range of the ions. If we compare the 
theoretical thickness of the barrier in our experiments with 
the calculated thickness using the experimental parameters 
by Tinchev et al. i&9,13], we find for our experimental 
parameters (Ar ions, 50 keV) a mean value for total thickness of 183 nm and for Tinchev et al. (0 ions, 100 
keV) a value of 387 nm. The thickness of the barrier 
should be in our experiments less than half of the value 
calculated using Tinchev’s experimental parameters. This 
value can be lowered using thinner YBCO and PMMA 
films. 
Another problem of preparation of high-T, junction by 
particle beam modification (e.g. electrons or ions) will 
occur in the stability of these junctions. Suzuki et al. [ 141 
and Tolpygo et al. [ 1.51 described electron modified bridges 
which have shown Shapiro steps in the current-voltage 
characteristics under microwave irradiation. They used 
electron energies of 400 keV [ 141 or up to 120 keV [ 151, 
respectively. Both groups concluded that the incident elec- 
trons in their described experiments had only enough 
energy for displacements of oxygen and not sufficient 
energy for displacements of Y, Ba and Cu atoms. The 
diffusion of oxygen atoms in the film could be the reason 
for the self-annealing of the electron modified bridges and 
therefore the relative instable electrical parameters, espe- 
cially after storage at room temperature. To compare these 
assumptions with ion beam modified thin films we used 
the displacement energies for Y, Ba, Cu and 0 given by

Baetzold [16] as input parameters and carried out TRIM 
calculations. The distribution of vacancies over depth for 
the four components Y, Ba, Cu and 0 is shown in Fig. 7. 
It is visible that approximately 50% of the total number of 
vacancies belongs to oxygen vacancies and the remaining 
SO% to Y, Ba and Cu lattice sites. The most deviation 
from chemical stoichiometry we can observe for Y and Ba, 
because of their different displacement energies (Y u 54.5 
cV and Ba u 18.6 eV) [16]. However, in contrast to the 
electron modified YBCO bridges the ion beam modified 
bridges by argon or oxygen ions with energies between 30 
and 100 keV should be more stable in time because of the 
considerably damaged cation lattice. In parallel to the 
experiments described in this paper we carried out investi- 
gations on ion beam irradiation of thin unpatterned YBCO 
films and measured the changes in crystal structure by 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford backscattering 
spectrometry with channeling (RBS-C) with increasing ion 
fluence and found a considerable damage in crystal struc- 
ture of cation lattice after 100 keV Ar ion irradiation#ith 
fluence values higher than 5 X 10r3/cm2. Experimental 
details of these investigations have been given in Refs. 
[ 17,181. TRIM calculations have also shown that the aver- 
age number of vacancies generated by each ion lies for our 
experiments with argon ions of energies between 50 and 
100 keV in the range of 500 to 900 (Table 2). This result 
leads to the assumption that the damage caused by ion 
irradiation will be the main process of modification in the 
YBCO film in comparison to any implantation effect. For 
this reason it should not be so important to use always 
noble gas ions. If we compare the number of vacancies per 
ion of oxygen and argon ions both with the same incident 
energy of 100 keV in Table 2 then we can see a double 
value for Ar ions and additionally half of the longitudinal 
projected range as for oxygen at the same energy. There- 
fore we can assume that the produced defect density with 
100 keV argon irradiation in our experiments will amount 
four times greater than for 100 keV oxygen irradiation 
carried out by Tinchev et al. [8,9]. This conclusion we 
used to approximate the ion fluence which is necessary to 
reduce the critical current density and to generate a weak 
link in the high-T, material. It has been examined also for 
generation of weak links for dc-SQUIDS and dc-SQUID 
gradiometers by ion irradition with oxygen ions using the 
lower ion energy of 30 keV in thin YBCO films. The 
results are published elsewhere [ 19,201. 
4.3. Electrical properties 
The ion irradiation results in a change of the electrical 
properties of the superconductor. Fig. 8 shows the depen- 
dence of resistivity of 12 pm wide bridges (YBCO film 
thickness 70 nm) on temperature (R(T)) for samples irradi- 
ated with 50 keV Ar+ ions of different ion fluences 
through a slit mask with line width of 160 nm. For ion 
fluences increasing up to 1.2 X lOI cm-* we find a bridge width 12 p

lowering of the critical transition temperature T&. an in- 
creasing room temperature resistivity and a typical foot 
structure. The changes are similar to the results on unpat- 
terned films [ 17,181 .and differ only in the absolute changes 
of T,, at these fluence values. Fig. 9 shows the critical 
current I, versus temperature obtained from Z-V curves 
after ion irradiation. The convex shape of the curve indi- 
cates the SNS character of the coupling. 
The critical current density j, as a function of tempera- 
ture is given in Fig. 10 for different ion fluence values of 
Ar+ (50 keV). With increasing fluence we observe the 
mentioned lowering in T,, and a reduction of j, as well as 
a reduction of the gradient of the j,(T) curve. Fig. 11 
shows the current-voltage characteristics under the influ- 
ence of microwave irradiation (13.7 GHz) for different 
power at a temperature of 60 K. Pronounced Shapiro steps 
are visible (Fig. 1 la) and their step heights vary with 
microwave power (Fig. 11 b). The power dependence of 
the step heights for the step numbers 0 to 3 are shown in 
Fig. 12. The current-voltage curves show at temperatures 
nearby T,, RSJ-like behaviour. With decreasing tempera-

lent stability in time of the electrical parameters even after 
several cooling-heating cycles and after a storage of about 
6 months at room temperature. 
5. Summary and conclusions 
In this paper we have investigated the changes in the 
electrical properties of bridges in high-T, thin films by ion 
beam irradiation in nanometer dimensions. To protect the 
films outside of the region to be modified we used a 
PMMA mask. The thickness of the PMMA layer was 
evaluted with the TRIM program. Further we used the 
TRIM program as a first step for estimation of the broad- 
ening of the barrier considering the lateral projected range 
and straggling as well as the penetration depth of the ions 
and the distribution of vacancies for different elements. 
The damages in the cation lattice seem to play an impor- 
tant role for the stability of the junctions. The modified 
bridges have shown Josephson-like properties under mi- 
crowave irradiation and a high stability of the electrical 
parameters in time, sufficient for the preparation of stable 
operating dc-SQUIDS and dc-SQUID gradiometer circuits. 
In a next step, more efforts have to be done in deter- 
mining the thickness of the barrier taking into account the 
influence of mask geometry and of diffusion on lateral and 
longitudinal vacancy distribution, as it is well known from 
process simulation in microelectronic industry.
