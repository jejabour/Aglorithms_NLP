Abstract 
Pb(Fe, ,,Ta, ,2 >O, (PFT) thin films with the perovskite structure have been prepared successfully on Si(II1) substrates by 
a sol-gel process. The crystallinity of the thin films was characterized by X-ray diffraction and their micro structures were 
observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the perovskite phase could only be formed with an 
excess lead content over stoichiometric composition and primary perovskite phase with a strong (1 IO) orientation was 
obtained at annealing temperatures between 680°C and 730°C.

1. Introduction 
Growing demand for ferroelectric materials with 
device capability has produced a great interest in the 
fabrication of ferroelectric thin films with controlled 
microstructures. Thin films with epitaxial or oriented 
structures are much preferred for some electronic 
and photo-optic devices, such as non-volatile memo- 
ries, surface acoustic wave devices and optical wave- 
guides [1,2]. Sol-gel processing is promising for the 
preparation of epitaxial or oriented ferroelectric thin 
films, as are some established methods for epitaxial 
growth, such as MOCVD and MBE. The distinct 
advantages of the sol-gel method include good con-

formity and low cost. Recently, preferred orientation 
and epitaxy of ferroelectric thin films on different 
substrates have been reported by some authors; cor- 
responding thin film ferroelectric compounds include 
PbTiO, [31, Pb(Zr, _ .Ti.)O, (PZT) 141, 
Pb(Mg,,,Nb,,,)O, (PMN) [5] and LiNbO, [6]. It 
has been shown that epitaxy and orientation behavior 
depends on many factors, especially on the structure 
and orientation of the substrate, and the heat treat- 
ment conditions. 
Pb(Fe,,,Ta,,,)O, (PFT) is a lead-based ferro- 
electric material which crystallizes with the general 
perovskite structure, ABO,. The compound is cubic 
and paraelectric at room temperature, with a Curie 
temperature, T, of about -40°C. Most of the previ- 
ous research on this material indicates a random 
distribution of the two B-site ions, Fe3+ and Ta5’ 
[7]. There is, however, a debate regarding the ferro- 
electric relaxor properties of this material near Tc.

Another interesting property of this compound is that 
it shows antiferromagnetic ordering, with a NCel 
temperature of 180 K. The magnetic ordering was 
attributed to the Fe3+ ions in the crystal lattice [8], 
but the detailed mechanism of this ferromagnetic 
phase transition is not established. Also the relation- 
ship between this phase transition and the micro 
structural state of this compound is still under inves- 
tigation. One possible application for this compound 
is as a microwave dielectric in multilayer integrated 
circuits (as solid solutions with PFN, N = niobium, 
which give higher dielectric constants). 
Previous research on PFT was mostly carried out 
on bulk materials, including ceramics and single 
crystals. Until now, there have been no reports on 
PFT thin films, possibly because their preparation is 
relatively complex and the formation of a deleterious 
metastable pyrochlore phase is difficult to avoid 191. 
In this work, a sol-gel route for fabrication of PFT 
thin films was explored. (1 IO) oriented thin films 
were prepared on Si(l 11) substrates, and were char- 
acterized by 8-20 X-ray diffraction (XRD), o-rock- 
ing curves and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM). 
2. Method 
The flow chart for the preparation of PFT thin 
films is shown in Fig. 1. Lead t-butoxide and iron 
acetate were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol to obtain 
a 0.02 M solution. The concentration of the solution 
was lower than that which is used in the general 
sol-gel processing but was more suitable for achiev- 
ing a very homogeneous solution. It was found that 
the solution became cloudy and small particles ap- 
peared when a more concentrated solution of Pb and 
Fe precursors was mixed with the Ta precursor. It 
was necessary to heat the Fe(H) acetate solution at 
95°C in air for about 6 h to oxidize the Fe” ions 
and to convert it into Fe3+. Tantalum(V) chloride 
was dissolved in methanol to get a 0.02 M solution. 
The solution was refluxed at 60°C for about 24 h in 
order to make Tasf form Ta alkoxide. The Pb 
precursor with 50% excess over stoichiometric com- 
position of PFT was mixed with the Fe precursor 
first. The Ta solution was then added slowly, while 
shaking, in order to obtain the final PFT solution. Heat treated at 400°C

The solution was transparent and stable and could be 
kept for a few days without any precipitation. 
Thin films were prepared on pieces of single 
crystal Si( 1 1 I) wafers by successive spin coating and 
drying. The substrates were cleaned in acetone, 
deionized water and ethyl alcohol sequentially for 5 
min, using an ultrasonic bath. The PFT solution, 
after hydrolysis, was applied to the substrate as 
droplets from a syringe. After each application, the 
substrate was spun at 2000 rpm for 2.5 s to form one 
layer of wet film and was heated at 400°C for 5 min 
to dry and to decompose the residual organics. Be- 
cause the solution was very diluted. the above spin 
coating and heat treatment process had to be re- 
peated about 100 times to obtain the desired thick- 
ness. The thickness of the final film was determined 
with an a-step profilometer and was 300 nm. The 
Q. Su et al./Materials Letters 28 (19961 183-188 185 
thin films were homogeneous and crack-free before 
annealing when observed with a light microscope. 
Crystallization of the resulting films was carried 
out by annealing for one hour in an air atmosphere at 
various temperatures ranging from 550°C to 850°C. 
The films were heated to a given temperature at a 
rate of 10°C min- ’ . After annealing the furnace was 
switched off and they were allowed to cool down 
naturally. The thickness was reduced by about 15% 
after annealing. 
X-ray diffraction was carried out with a powder 
diffractometer (Phillips MPD- 188OI), using Cu Kol 
radiation and 0-20 scanning. The preferred orienta- 
tions of the thin films were further studied by record- 
ing the (110) o-rocking curves, which was obtained 
using Cu Kol radiation with a high resolution XRD 
system (Phillips MPD- 188011). The microstructures 
of the films were investigated using a Phillips CM20 
TEM, employing plan-view specimens. The TEM 
specimens were prepared by polishing the sample 
carefully on Al,O, polishing papers by hand, reduc- 
ing the samples thickness to = 30 pm and then ion 
milling with 5 kV argon ions at an angle of inci- 
dence of 12”. 3. Results and discussion 
As mentioned earlier, the perovskite phase of 
Pb(Fe,,,Ta,,,)O, is not easy to form and the nucle- 
ation of a metastable pyrochlore-type phase is very 
difficult to avoid in the preparation of bulk materials 
[IO]. We added more than the stoichiometric require- 
ment of the Pb precursor to the mixed PFT solution 
in an attempt to prevent the formation of pyrochlore 
phase in the thin films during the annealing process. 
Fig. 2 shows the X-ray powder diffraction spectra for 
PFT thin films annealed at 720°C for one hour with 
different excess Pb contents in the Pb precursor of 
the PFT sol: (a) 20%, (b) 50%, cc> 100%. For the 
film spin-coated from the sol with 20% Pb excess 
over the stoichiometric composition of PFT, both the 
pyrochlore and perovskite phases were formed when 
annealed at 720°C for 1 h, and there was a great 
amount of pyrochlore phase occurring in this film, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). This effect was most likely 
caused by loss of lead in the heat-treatment process 
in a Pb-deficient environment, which promotes the 
formation of the pyrochlore-type phase. Pure per- 
ovskite phase could be obtained from the sol with 
Fig. 2. X-ray diffraction patterns of PFT thin films prepared from sols with different lead excesses and annealed at 720°C for 1 h: (a) 20%,

50% lead excess. Lead oxides were easily derived 
from the sol if there was too much lead precursor in 
the solution. For example, for a thin film prepared 
with 100% lead excess, there was no apparent py- 
rochlore and perovskite phase, but both amorphous 
and crystallized lead oxide phases were also present 
as shown in Fig. lc. Therefore, the formation of the 
pyrochlore phase in the thin films was greatly influ- 
enced by the Pb-excess in the solution. 
Using thin films obtained from a sol with a 50% 
Pb-excess, the crystallization behavior at different 
annealing temperatures, ranging from 550°C to 
850°C was investigated by XRD. Fig. 3 illustrates 
XRD spectra for such thin films annealed for 1 h at 
(a> 6OO”C, (b) 700°C (c) 800°C respectively. The 
perovskite phase was formed at 600°C and its amount 
increased with increasing annealing temperature. Pri- 
mary perovskite phase was obtained at temperatures 
between 680°C and 730°C. These thin films were 
crystalline with a strong (110) orientation on Si( 11 l), 
as shown in Fig. 3b, in which there was still a broad 
pyrochlore peak at 31.4” and 49” but smaller com- 
pared with that of the perovskite phase. The amount 
of pyrochlore phase in these films was less than l%, 
as determined from the relative intensity of XRD patterns. When the annealing temperature was 
changed to 8OO”C, not only was the percentage of the 
perovskite phase changed but also distribution of 
grain orientations, as determined by the intensities of 
reflections in the XRD spectra. In those from the 
800°C films, the {loo} reflection appears with about 
the same intensity as the (1 lo} reflection. However, 
the pyrochlore phase also crystallized quite well at 
800°C as witnessed by the stronger intensity of the 
corresponding X-ray diffraction peaks. This was at- 
tributed to the tendency for evaporation of lead 
oxides at the higher temperature. 
It is very interesting to analyze the growth of 
perovskite and pyrochlore phases during the anneal- 
ing process. The perovskite phase began to form at 
550°C as identified a weak perovskite (110) peak 
from the XRD patterns of these films. Broad peaks 
of the pyrochlore phase were observed in the XRD 
patterns of these films when they were annealed at 
temperatures below 750°C. Because the PFT thin 
films were prepared from the sol with 50% excess of 
lead, there will be still a Pb-excess in the as-de- 
posited films after decomposing the organics at 400°C 
during the preparation process. The perovskite phase 
will be easier to nucleate and grow than the py-

quently the pyrochlore phase is very difficult to grow 
at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, with 
the greater loss of lead by evaporation of the oxides, 
the pyrochlore phase has a greater chance to crystal- 
lize, while the perovskite phase becomes weaker and 
other crystal orientations with higher activation en- 
ergy for nucleation may appear, as observed in Fig.

full width at half maximum (FWHM) is less than 
0.2”, which means that the PFT thin films were 
highly oriented on the Sic1 11) substrate. 
The microstructure and grain size of the films 
spun from the sol with 50% Pb-excess and annealed 
at different temperatures were observed by TEM Fig.

crograph of a thin film annealed at 700°C. The grains 
in this film are very small and homogeneous, and

their size varies from 30 nm to 70 nm. The typical 
grain morphologies of the films annealed at lower 
temperatures (550°C) and higher temperatures 
(800°C) are shown in Fig. 5b and 5c respectively. 
We can see that fine perovskite grains with a size of 
= 10 nm were formed at 550°C and were surrounded 
by the featureless materials, which were probably 
amorphous pyrochlore, lead oxide or uncrystallized 
PFT. For the films annealed at 8OO”C, small grains 
with a size of = 30 nm and good crystallinity were 
observed. Most of them were identified as the py- 
rochlore grains from electron diffraction. Fig. 6 
shows a plan-view high resolution transmission elec- 
tron image of the film in Fig. 5a. Study of the lattice 
fringes that are visible within the grains of the 
perovskite PFT phase, indicates that grains in the 
thin film are relatively defect-free. 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, PFT thin films with the perovskite 
structure were prepared. Highly (1 IO) oriented films 
were successfully prepared by the sol-gel route. The 
perovskite phase in the PFT thin film can be formed 
from a sol with 50% lead excess. PFT films with 
dominant perovskite phase and little fine grained 
pyrochlore were obtained when they were annealed 
at temperatures between 680°C and 730°C. Study by 
TEM shows that these thin films are crystalline and 
that they have a very fine grain size, 30-70 nm. 
Mechanisms for the formation of perovskite and pyrochlore phases under different process conditions 
have been discussed and are found to be critically 
dependent on the lead oxide content of the solution 
from which films are spun.
