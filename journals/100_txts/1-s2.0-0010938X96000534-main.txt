Abstract-Microdissolution of calcium ions from calcium-ion-implanted titanium into nitric acid solutions 
(pH -0.99, 0, 1 and 2) and phosphatecitric acid buffers (pH 5.2 and 7.2) at 310K for 103-5x 10’s was 
characterized using X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. As a result, the surface oxides with calcium were found to 
dissolve in the solutions. Oxygen decreased and titanium increased in the surface oxide according to the dissolution. 
In addition, hydroxyl radicals decreased in number and the proportion of TI ‘4c in titanium increased. Core-level 
binding energies of calcium, and titanium originating from Ti4+, decreased with the dissolution. These changes 
were caused by the transformation of surface oxide according to the dissolution. Calcium dissolved and, 
consequently, the surface oxide became titanium oxide. It is feasible to estimate the microdissolution of an element 
from materials using surface analysis techniques. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd 
INTRODUCTION 
Titanium implanted by calcium ions with an acceleration energy of 18 keV has useful 
properties as a biomaterial. Calcium phosphate precipitation on titanium in an electrolyte is 
tremendously accelerated by calcium-ion-implantation.’ This phenomenon has also been 
observed on calcium-ion-implanted titanium retrieved from a canine femur.2 In addition, 
osteogenic cells on titanium are activated and the formation of osteoid tissue by the cells is 
accelerated when calcium ions are implanted in titanium.3 Calcium-ion-implanted titanium 
is a very suitable biomaterial. This favorable property of the calcium-ion-implanted 
titanium is caused by the implanted calcium ions, the surface-modified layer formed by ion 
implantation. The surface-modified layer consists of calcium titanate when ions are 
implanted with lOi and 10” ions/cm2, and both calcium oxide (hydroxide) and calcium 
titanate when implanted with 10” ions/cm2.4 There is a possibility that the outermost 
surface of the surface-modified layer is calcium hydroxide in both cases described above. 
Calcium ions exist in surface oxide which grows with ion implantation. The thicknesses of 
the surface modified layers are very thin; approximately 6 nm, 8 nm and 13 nm on specimens 
implanted with lOI ions/cm2, 10” ions/cm’ and lo’* ions/cm2, respectively.5-7 This 
surface-modified layer works as a substrate improving hard-tissue compatibility. 
One of the causes of good bone conductivity of calcium-ion-implanted titanium is 
possibly microdissolution of calcium ions into the bioliquid, inducing the precipitation of 
calcium phosphate on the material by supersaturation in the bioliquid near the material.

This mechanism is similar to dissolution of calcium and silicon from bioactive glasses.’ 
Therefore, the confirmation of dissolution of calcium ions and the estimation of the 
dissolution rate are important for the understanding of the behavior of calcium-ion- 
implanted titanium in biological systems. It is difficult to detect the dissolution by analysis of 
calcium in the solution into which calcium-ion-implanted titanium is immersed and calcium 
ions dissolve because the concentration of calcium ions dissolved is very small even if all the 
calcium ions are dissolved. Naturally, the complete release of calcium ions hardly occurs in 
bioliquid. Another appropriate method is necessary for the estimation. 
In this study, changes in compositions and chemical states of calcium in surface- 
modified layers were characterized using X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) to 
estimate the amount of dissolution of calcium ions from the surface. The dissolution of 
calcium from the surface as well as the change in the chemical condition due to the 
dissolution is consequently assessed using XPS. This information will provide an important 
clue for the understanding of the bone conduction of calcium-ion-implanted titanium. 
This study also attempts to use surface analysis techniques for the estimation of 
dissolution of an element from a material when the amount of dissolution of the element is 
small and the detection of the element in solvent is difficult. In the field of biomaterials, 
microdissolution often plays important roles. For example, the bone formation on bioactive 
glasses occurs via the microrelease of ions.* Therefore, the estimation of dissolution of an 
element from a biomaterial is important in investigating the performance of bone 
conductiyity. Also in other fields where a similar situation exists, this approach will be 
very useful. 
The materials investigated in this study were assumed to be used for biomaterials. 
Therefore, the specimens were treated in the ambient atmosphere and exposed to air before 
analysis. 
EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
Preparation of specimens 
Commercially pure titanium plates 0.4mm in thickness were used as the starting 
material. Their chemical composition is shown in Table 1. The titanium plates were 
metallographically polished followed by polishing with diamond paste composed of 1 pm 
particles, ultrasonic rinsing in acetone and ethanol for 900 s each, and drying with a stream 
of high-purity nitrogen ( > 99.999%). 
Calcium ions were implanted into only one side of the titanium plate with an 
acceleration energy of 18 keV and ion-beam current-density of 50 pA/cm2. The assist gas 
for the implantation was krypton. Calcium ions were uniformly implanted in amounts of 
10” ions/cm2. The color of the calcium-ion-implanted titanium was pale gold. The calcium-

ion-implanted plates were ultrasonically rinsed in acetone and ethanol for 900 s each, and 
dried with the nitrogen. The acetone and ethanol were not degassed and dehydrated. In 
addition, the specimens were exposed to air during the operation. The specimens were 
restored in a desiccator until the surface analysis. 
The immersion in nitric acid and buffer solutions 
Nitric acid solutions were used for dissolution of calcium ions and for the 
characterization of changes in chemical states of elements in specimens caused by the 
dissolution. Specimens were immersed in nitric acid solutions (9.68,1, lo- ’ and 10e2 mol/l) 
at 3 10 K for 1 03-1 O6 s in scaled polytetrafluoroethylene bottles. The pH values of the nitric 
acid solutions were -0.99, 0, 1 and 2 for 9.68 mol/l, 1 mol/l, 10-i mol/l and 10e2 mol/l 
solutions, respectively. Phosphate-citric acid buffers (pH 5.2 and 7.2) prepared with 
Na2HP04 and C6Hs07 were also adopted because the pH of hard tissue near which 
materials are inserted immediately decreases to 5.2,9 although the normal biological system 
pH is 7.2-7.4. Specimens were immersed in the buffers at 310 K for 103-5 x lo6 s. The ion 
concentrations and pH values of the buffer solutions are summarized in Table 2. The buffer 
capacity of the solutions may be affected by the existence of calcium ions.” However, no 
change in pH was observed during the experiments. After immersion, specimens were rinsed 
three times in de-ionized water for 300 s and dried with nitrogen. 
X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy 
X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy was performed with an electron spectrometer (SSI, 
SSXlOO). All binding energies given in this paper are relative to the Fermi level and all 
spectra were excited by the monochromatized Al Ka 1,2 line (1486.61 eV). The electron 
energy analyser was operated in the constant analysing energy mode at a pass energy of 
20 eV, and calibrated with the energies of Au 4f7,2 (84.07 eV) and Au 4fsi2 (87.74 eV) of pure 
gold and Cu 2p3,2 (932.53 eV), Cu 2~312 (952.35 eV), and the Cu Auger L3M4,sM4,~ line 
(918.65eV) of pure copper.” Resolution with full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 
the Au 4fTi2 peak was 0.96eV under the experimental conditions. The base pressure 
was 5.8 x lo-* Pa during the spectral acquisitions. The take-off angle of the photo-electron 
was 35” from the surface of the specimen. The quantification was performed according to 
the methods of Asami et al.123’3 and the compositions of surface oxides only were 
determined. In addition, the thickness of surface oxide film was simultaneously calculated. 
Empirica114-16 and published data” were applied to the photo-ionization cross-sections for 
the quantification. Relative photo-ionization cross-sections of the core-levelj of element i to 
that of 0 Is, oii /coin, used in this study are summarized in Table 3.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Change in relative concentration 
The gold color of specimens gradually returned to the original titanium color during 
immersion. C 1s spectra obtained from all specimens did not contain carbonate because no 
peak was detected at the binding energy region of 289-290 eV where the C 1s peak 
originating from carbonate should appear.“.” The carbon detected by XPS was assigned to 
surface contamination. In addition, nitrogen was detected on some specimens. However, the 
N 1s peak originating from nitrate was undetected in all experiments, indicating that nitrate 
was not present on the specimens. Nitrogen, therefore, originated from surface 
contamination from the environment. On the other hand, phosphorus was detected from 
specimens immersed in the buffers. The phosphorus existed as a phosphate judging from the 
peak binding energy. ‘8.19 The phosphate apparently came from phosphate ions in the buffer. 
The phosphate is usually adsorbed by titanium and did not constitute the surface oxide.‘.’ 
Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were not contained in the quantification. The relative 
concentrations of calcium, oxygen, and/or titanium in specimens before and after 
immersion, assuming that the gross amount of these elements detected by XPS was 
100 mol%, were calculated. 
Changes in calcium concentrations of specimens immersed in nitric acid solutions and 
phosphate4tric acid buffers as immersion time are shown in Fig. 1. The value marked 
‘unimmersion’ represents the calcium concentration of calcium-ion-implanted titanium 
before immersion. Calcium decreased not only in nitric acid solutions but also in the buffer 
solutions, indicating that calcium dissolved into these solutions. The larger the 
concentration of nitric acid solution or the lower the pH of the solution, the larger the 
dissolution of calcium was. Also, the decrease of calcium in the pH 5.2 buffer was larger than 
that in the pH 7.2 buffer. When the concentration of calcium was under approximately 
6 mol%, the gold color was eliminated. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the logarithm of the 
calcium concentration. cCa, decreases linearly with the logarithm of immersion time, t. 
Figure 2 shows the changes in oxygen concentrations of specimens immersed in nitric 
acid solutions and the buffer solutions as immersion time. Oxygen also decreased with the 
dissolution of calcium by the immersion in the solutions, and the logarithm of the oxygen 
concentration, co, decreases linearly with the logarithm of immersion time, t. The relative 
concentration of titanium was increased by the immersion in the solutions as shown in Fig. 
3. The logarithm of the titanium concentration, cri, increases with the logarithm of 
immersion time, t.

Proportions of spectra in different chemical states 
0 1s spectra 
The 0 1s XPS spectrum decomposed into three spectra originating from oxide, 02-, 
hydroxide or hydroxyl groups, OH-, and hydrate and/or adsorbed water.20 Figure 4 shows 
the change in the ratio of the area of the spectrum originating from 02- to that from OH-, 
[O-‘]/[OH-1, as a function of immersion time. The ratio proportionally increases with the 
logarithm of immersion time, indicating that hydroxyl groups decreases with immersion 
time or the dissolution of calcium. 
Ti 2p spectra 
The Ti 2p XPS spectrum decomposed into peaks corresponding to Ti’, Ti2 + , Ti3 + and 
Ti4+ states. The proportion of the Ti4+ spectrum, that of Ti02, in the oxidised states (Ti'+ , 
Ti3+ and Ti4+) was of considerable interest. Changes in the proportion of the Ti4+ oxide 
state are shown in Fig. 5. The proportion of the Ti4+ oxidised state increases with 
immersion time, indicating that surface oxide becomes more stable with immersion. 
The thickness of surface oxide 
The thickness of the surface oxide could not be determined in several specimens 
immersed for short duration because the metallic state, Ti’, was undetected in the

specimens. The calculation of the thickness is performed by the ratio of the integrated 
intensity of the metallic state to that of the oxide state at the same time as the quantification. 
The change in the thickness is shown in Fig. 6. The thickness of the oxide is decreased by 
immersion, indicating that the surface oxide dissolves with the dissolution of calcium. 
Core-level binding energy 
Core-level binding energies of carbon did not have any noticeable tendency to change 
with immersion time. The binding energies were in the range of 284.9-285.4 eV. 
Changes in the core-level binding energy of calcium with immersion time are shown in 
Fig. 7. The binding energy increases proportionally with the logarithm of immersion time, 
indicating that the chemical atmosphere around calcium is changed by immersion or by the 
dissolution into the solution, that is the composition around calcium is dependent on the 
depth. 
The changes in core-level binding energies of the 0 1 s electrons in the 02- state and the 
Ti 2~312 electrons in the Ti4+ state are shown in Figs 8 and 9, respectively. Both binding 
energies increased with immersion time or the dissolution of calcium.

DISCUSSION 
The relative concentrations determined in this study were those only in the outer part of 
the oxide layer at a depth smaller than the thickness of the surface oxide, when the oxide was 
thicker than the analysing depth of XPS, that is, when the specimen was immersed for a 
short term. On the other hand, the detection depth was larger than the thickness of the 
surface oxide when the oxide was thinner than the detection depth of XPS. That is, the 
titanium substrate was also detected along with the oxide. In such cases, the quantification 
was performed for the only surface oxide layer and the substrate value was not employed for 
the calculation. 
Calcium dissolution kinetics 
The logarithm of calcium concentration, cCa, has a linear relationship with the logarithm 
of immersion time, t (Fig. 1). The following equation holds: 
logcca = kIlogt + kx (1) 
where kI and Frz are constants. The kl is approximately -0.70 for nitric acid solutions and 
-0.23 for the buffer solutions which are independent of the concentrations. Equation (1) 
holds only cc&co where co is the initial concentration of calcium which is indicated by the 
level unimmersion in Fig. 1.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, the dissolution does not begin immediately after immersion but 
an incubation time is needed before the dissolution. The incubation time for the dissolution 
is determined as the intersection of the extrapolated lines in Fig. 1 with the initial 
concentration of calcium, co, before immersion (unimmersion) in Fig. 1. The incubation 
time as a function of pH of nitric acid is shown in Fig. 10. The logarithm of the incubation 
time decreases linearly with the logarithm of the concentration of nitric acid. In the pH 5.2 
and 7.2 buffers, the incubation times were 9 x lo4 s and 6 x lo5 s, respectively. Once the 
dissolution of calcium ions begins, the dissolution follows equation (1). In the calcium-ion- 
implanted titanium used in the study. calcium atoms distribute as a Gaussian function in the 
depth direction and the maximum concentration locates at a certain depth from the 
outermost surface.5-7 The concentration of calcium at the outermost surface is relatively 
small. Therefore, the dissolution of calcium is slight when the outermost surface dissolves. 
The incubation time equals the time for the dissolution of the outermost surface that is 
specific to the concentration of the solution. 
From equation (l), 
cCa = 10kltkh = k3tkl (2) 
where k3 = 10”‘. The amount of dissolved calcium is CO - cca. Therefore, the dissolution rate 
of calcium from the specimens, rCa, is

Consequently, the dissolution rate of calcium ions from calcium-ion-implanted titanium 
is proportional to immersion time to the power of (ki - 1). In other words, the dissolution 
rate in nitric acid solutions is proportional to t-‘.“, and that in the buffer solutions is 
proportional to t-‘.23. 
Change in surface oxide according to dissolution 
The surface-modified layer of calcium-ion-implanted titanium consists of calcium 
titanate. Calcium dissolved from the surface oxide with immersion and the concentration 
of calcium decreased (Fig. 1). Oxygen also decreased (Fig. 2) while titanium increased (Fig. 
3) with immersion time. These phenomena correspond to the dissolution of surface oxide. If 
the composition of calcium titanate is CaTiOs, the following change in the surface oxide 
possibly occurs due to the release of calcium and dissolution of the oxide.

where (ox) represents the oxide state. According to equation (4), the relative concentrations 
of calcium and oxygen decrease while that of titanium increases. This is supported by the

Fig. 6. Changes in thickness of surface oxide of calcium-ion-implanted titanium with immersion

In a previous study, it has shown that the amounts of hydroxyl groups in the surface 
oxide of calcium-ion-implanted titanium (15.40 + 10.58 nm-*) were considerably larger 
than that on titanium (1.84 + 1.56 nm-*),*I which is supported by another XPS study.4 In 
this study, it is demonstrated as shown in Fig. 4, that the amount of hydroxyl radical 
decreases with immersion time, indicating that the composition of surface oxide of calcium- 
ion-implanted titanium approaches that of titanium. This also supports the change 
according to equation (4) if the oxygen in the oxide is replaced by OH- in proportion to 
the number of oxygen atom. In addition, the increase in the binding energy of Ti 2psi2 
electrons (Fig. 9) will correspond to the change in equation (4), since the Ti4+ 2pa12 electron 
binding energy for CaTi03,458.4 eV, is smaller than that for Ti02, 458.8 eV.4 The binding 
energy is 458.99 eV when calcium completely dissolves to pH 0.99 nitric acid (Fig. 9) which 
is in accordance with the binding energy for an anodizing oxide film on titanium 
(458.98 +0.04 eV).** 
The thickness of surface oxide is 3.5-5.2 nm when most of the calcium was released by 
immersion (Fig. 6). These values are in the range of the thickness of surface oxide on 
titanium, indicating that the surface oxide thickness also approaches that on titanium itself. 
Furthermore, the binding energy of Ca 2psi2 electrons (Eb,caZp) increases with the 
dissolution of calcium (Fig. 7). The Eb,c+, for CaTiOs is 346.6 eV and that for Ca(OH)* is

347.2 eV according to a previous study.4 Calcium existed as neither carbonate nor nitrate, 
since no carbonate and nitrate peaks were detected by XPS. The change in Eb,cazp is 
explicable as follows: calcium is present as calcium hydroxide in the outermost surface of the 
surface oxide because calcium easily reacts with moisture in ambient air. This hypothesis is 
supported by the large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of calcium-ion-implanted 
titanium as described above.2’ The relative amount of calcium hydroxide in the surface 
oxide is small and E6,ca2r is governed by calcium titanate, which is the main component. On 
the other hand, the relative amount of calcium hydroxide in the surface is large after the 
dissolution of the surface oxide. The binding energy, Eb,ca;?p, is, in that case, governed by the 
calcium hydroxide because the amount of calcium titanate is relatively small. Therefore, 
equation (4) is strictly rewritten as follows in an aqueous solution by considering the mass 
balance and electric charge balance.

where (aq) represents species in an aqueous solution. Therefore, calcium titanate and 
calcium hydroxide as surface oxide of calcium-ion-implanted titanium release calcium in the 
solution, and the resultant surface oxide tends to titanium oxide. 
The mean composition of the surface oxide of calcium-ion-implanted titanium before 
immersion is determined from the XPS data on account of the mass balance and the 
proportions of various states of oxygen as follows.

The valence of titanium is calculated to be 3.3 from equation (6). On the other hand, the 
valence of titanium is estimated by the integrated intensities of Ti 2p spectra originating 
from Ti2+, Ti3+, and Ti4+ states as 3.6. The discrepancy of the above valences, 3.3 and 3.6, 
is within the range of experimental error. Apart from the above estimation, the following 
composition is derived from the electric charge balance and mass balance assuming that

discrepancy is caused by the existence of Ti2+ and Ti3+ in the surface oxide. The chemical 
composition of the surface oxide of the material immersed in pH - 0.99 nitric acid for lo5 s, 
when calcium ions are completely dissolved by the immersion, is determined as follows. 
Ti0r.67(OH)0,33 .0.22H20 (8) 
The valence of titanium is determined as 3.7 from equation (8). Also, from the integrated 
intensities of Ti 2p spectra originating from Ti*+, Ti3+, and Ti4+ states, the valence is 
estimated to be 3.7. Both valences are completely in accord with each other. The valence of 
titanium in equation (6), 3.3, increases to 3.7 in equation (8) with immersion, which is also 
supported by the increase of the proportion of Ti4+ in surface oxide, as shown in Fig. 5. 
When calcium ions are implanted in a titanium surface, the ions take oxygen away from 
titanium oxide because the free energy of oxidation of calcium is smaller than that of 
titanium,23 inducing Ti2+ and Ti3+ oxide states. A similar phenomenon is observed in Ti- 
Zr alloys, in which zirconium takes oxygen atoms from titanium in the surface oxide.24 The 
proportion of Ti4+ in the surface oxide increased with immersion (Fig. 5). That is, the 
proportions of lower valence oxides, such as Ti*+ and Ti3 + , decreased. This indicates that 
titanium in the surface oxide is more stable after immersion. The change occurs not only in 
nitric acid but also in the buffers. Therefore, the surface oxide state become the stable state 
due to the release of calcium. In other words, surface oxide of calcium-ion-implanted 
titanium is unstable in aqueous solutions because of the existence of calcium.

The gold color of the calcium-ion-implanted titanium should originate from Ti2+ oxide 
such as TiO. The elimination of the color after dissolution of the surface oxide is caused by 
the decrease of Ti’+. In addition, the decrease of the thickness of the surface oxide may 
influence the change in the color. 
DISSOLUTION INTO HARD TISSUE 
The above discussion is correct not only for nitric acid solutions but also for the buffers. 
The dissolution of calcium ions begins approximately one day after insertion of calcium- 
ion-implanted titanium into hard tissue because it is known that the pH of hard tissue 
decreases to 5.2 after the insertion,’ and calcium began to be released at 9 x lo4 s after 
immersion in pH 5.2 buffer. The decrease of calcium and the dissolution of the surface oxide 
were detected using XPS. The changes in binding energy accompanied by the release of 
calcium and dissolution of surface oxide were also detected in the buffer. Therefore, the 
microdissolution of calcium ions surely occurs when calcium-ion-implanted titanium is 
inserted into hard tissue, since the pH near the inserted material decreases to 5.2.’ This 
induces tile supersaturation of calcium ions to calcium phosphate, which will accelerate 
bone formation. Even after the pH of hard tissue is recovered, the microdissolution of 
Microdissolution of calcium ions 1593 
calcium ions from calcium-ion-implanted titanium still continues because calcium is also 
released into pH 7.2 solution (Fig. 1). The microdissolution of calcium ions from calcium- 
ion-implanted titanium is possibly one of the causes of good bone conduction of the 
calcium-ion-implanted material. 
The methodology in the present study is useful for the estimation of the dissolution of an 
element from a material when the amount of dissolution is minute and the detection of the 
dissolution by analysis of the solvent is difficult. On the other hand, the changes in binding 
energies detected in the study may be available for the prediction of the dissolution of the 
element when the amount of dissolution is small. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. The dissolution rates of calcium ions from calcium-ion-implanted titanium into nitric 
acid and sodium-phosphate/citric-acid buffer are proportional to t-i.” and t-1.23, 
respectively, where t is the immersion time. 
2. The surface oxide on calcium-ion-implanted titanium releases calcium ions into 
solutions. Calcium titanate, one of the constituents of the surface oxide, changes to titanium 
oxide with the dissolution. 
3. The surface oxide dissolves and its thickness decreases with the dissolution of calcium 
in simulated solutions. 
4. The dissolution of calcium ions from calcium-ion-implanted titanium occurs when the 
material is inserted in hard tissue. 
5. It is feasible that the dissolution of an element from a materials can be estimated using 
surface analysis techniques when the dissolution amount is minute.
