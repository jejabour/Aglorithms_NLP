The kinetics of formation of the intermetallic y-CuTi and Cu,Ti phases during isothermal annealing of thin- 
film Cu/Ti systems with an excess of Cu has been investigated. The thin-film systems were formed upon 
preliminarily thermally oxidized Si-plates. Afler each annealing a quantitative phase analysis and an 
electrochemical anode dissolution were carried out. It is experimentally proven that the formation of the 
intermetallic phases is limited by diffusion processes. On the basis of the Arrhenius’ equation the activation 
energy and pre-exponential coefficient were determined. 
1. Introduction 
In our previous investigation’ we have shown that during iso- 
thermal annealing of a multi-layer Cu/Ti system with an excess 
of Cu the intermetallic y-CuTi and P-Cu,Ti compounds were 
formed. The formation of y-CuTi phase was observed at mini- 
mum annealing temperature of 260°C and that for the /?-Cu,Ti 
phase at 300°C. 
Reactive diffusion in the thermally evaporated thin-film Cu/Ti 
system with an excess of Cu has been investigated by Gershinskii 
et al.,* who defined the parameters of formation of the inter- 
metallic compounds CuTi and Cu,Ti2 in the temperature range 
40s500°C. In another paper3 the kinetic parameters of growth 
of CuTi and Cu,Ti phases in the range 35@45O”C for electron 
beam deposited bi-layers were defined. 
In this paper we report the kinetics of formation of the inter- 
metallic y-CuTi and /l-Cu,Ti compounds in two types of thin- 
film systems with an excess of Cu defined by two independent 
methods. 
2. Experimental technique 
The thin-film Cu/Ti systems were deposited by magnetron sput- 
tering of Cu and Ti in Ar at a gas pressure of 5 x lo-* Pa. The 
substrates were at ambient temperature. During the deposition 
the layer thickness was measured by hi-fi crystal microbalance 
with a silica plate. 
Two types of sample were the object of investigation. The 
first were multi-layer film systems formed upon preliminarily 
thermally oxidized (111) Si-plates (the thickness of the oxidized 
layer is 0.4 pm). The systems consisted of 21 sub-systems with a 
total thickness of 150 nm (Cu-100 nm, Ti-50 nm) and 21 
interphase boundaries of Cu and Ti, respectively, giving an 
atomic ratio of Cu : Ti = 3 : 1. The other specimens were bi-layer of Ti with a total thickness of 200 nm and Cu of 400 nm thickness 
deposited upon a silica substrate. 
The specimens were isothermally annealed in silica ampoules 
at a residual gas pressure of lo-’ Pa and temperature of 300, 
320, 340, 370, 400,420,440 and 470°C for a time interval from 
15 to 540 min. 
The phase formed was identified with an X-ray diffractometer 
DRON-UM-1 by the interplane distances according to ASTM4. 
After each annealing a quantitative phase analysis with Co 
K, emission according not calibration technique was carried out. 
The diffraction lines were done at diffraction angles 20 from 40 
to 168 degrees. The texture was accounted for by the inverse pole 
figures method. The total density of all n diffraction reflexes in 
the pointed 20 range was used. In the calculations the pole density 
(the statitic weight) Phkl of each plane system {hkl} was intro- 
duced with the expression : 
where : S,,,, is measured by the intensity of the diffraction maxima 
{hkl} ; 4,~ is the integral intensity of reflection from the planes 
{hkl} calculated on the basis of the known phase structures 
according to Refs 7 and 8. 
In the two-phase system the volume phase percents (C, and 
C,) were determined from the equations : 
Cl +c* = 100% (2)

Taking into account that the intermetallic compounds in the 
Cu/Ti system either in film or bulk specimens show laminar 
growth, the volume content C of each phase could be computed 
in a layer thickness Xof the intermetallic phase (EC = 100% and 
x:X = 150 nm is observed). 
For bi-layer systems the phase quantity was determined by the 
intermetallic layer thickness measured by the electrochemical 
anode dissolving method.‘,” The annealed specimens were closed 
in a cap with a special construction’ ensuring constancy of the 
dissolved area. The specimens were inserted as an anode in the 
electrolytic cell. The potential difference between the anode and 
cathode was kept constant. When the dissolving front reached 
the interphase boundary, a sharp change in the e.m.f value of the 
electrolytic cell was observed, which was probably due to different 
electrochemical anode potential of the phases. The process par- 
ameters, anode area, electrolyte composition and potential 
difference were chosen so that the anode potential change, i.e. 
the e.m.f. change, lead to proportional changing of the anode 
dissolving current. The time dependence of the anode dissolving 
current was experimentally measured. 
The phase thickness (X) was determined according to Far- 
aday’s law : 
A-=fX*Q (3) 
where : Q is the electricity quantity used for the phase dissolution 
and is determined by the area of the correspondent stage (between 
two neighbouring jumps of e.m.f.) in the experimental depen- 
dence of the dissolving current as a function of time; a the 
proportionality coefficient experimentally determined by the elec- 
tricity quantity used in the dissolution of a layer with a known 
thickness. 
The anodic dissolution conditions were as follows : electrolyte 
composition (0.4 ml H2S04 (1.84) + 10 g OH * C,H4 - COOH + 
100 ml CH,OH); dissolving area = 4.9 x IO-* cm*; potential 
difference = 0.9 V and cathode = copper. 
The following proportionality coefficients for Cu and Ti: 
a - 7.8 nm/mC and aTI = 4.3 nm/mC were experimentally C” - 
determined. 
Considering the stoichiometric y-CuTi structure with a Cu : Ti 
ratio of 1 : 1 the titanium atoms and “the belonging” interatomic 
spaces occupy 60% of the unit lattice volume. On the grounds of 
this we assume “the effective” thicknesses of Ti and Cu in y-CuTi 
phase dc, = 0.4 and dT = 0.6, respectively. For the stoichiometric 
/I-Cu3Ti structure with a Cu : Ti ratio of 3.12 : 0.88 “the effective” 
thicknesses are d,, = 0.7 and dT, = 0.3, respectively. 
The proportionality coefficient 4 for the i intermetallic phase 
was determined on the basis of “the effective” thicknesses of Cu 
and Ti for each phase. Taking into account that X, = d,,.,+ 
&, = 1 and Ql = (dcU_,)/(a,,) + (dT,.,)/(aT,), the expression of the 
proportionality coefficient is 
1 &u-i 4-i 
-==++ 
4 k” MTi (4) 
Thus the proportionality coefficients for both intermetallic 
phases determined according to (4) are : c(y_cuT, = 5.2 nm/mC and 
aa_Cu,T, = 6.3 nm/mC.

vol.% Cu, 15 vol.% Ti, 26 vol.% y-CuTi and 10 vol.% /I-Cu,Ti) ; 
(c) after annealing at 370°C for 540 min (36 vol.% Cu,43 vol.% 
y-CuTi and 21 vol.% /?-Cu,Ti). 
The confirmation of these results may be obtained using “the 
effective” thicknesses of Cu and Ti in the respective intermetallic 
phases according to the equations : 
(67% - Cc”) = 0.4C]yCuTi +O.~CB_C~~TI 
(33% -CT,) = 0.6Cy.c,T, +0.3Cfl_&,T, (5) 
where : C (in vol.%) is the respective phase content after anneal- 
ing. In the limit of experimental accuracy the phase analysis 
results satisfy eqns (5). 
Figure 2 shows the annealing time dependence of the layer 
thickness of y-CuTi and /I-Cu,Ti in the multi-layer system. The 
linear character of the dependences indicates that the formation 
of the intermetallic compounds is limited by the reagents’ (Cu 
and Ti) diffusion through the growing phases. Consequently the 
formation kinetics of a certain phase is described with the effective 
interdiffusion coefficient (D) in this phase. By the slope (G) of 
the curves (Figure 2) according to the equation G2 = 40 (cm’/s) 
the coefficients have been determined and the results are given in 
Table 1. 
Using the data in Table 1, curves 1 and 2 in Figure 3 were 
constructed, whose characteristics correspond to the Arrhenius’ 
equation 
This fact allows the activation energy (E,) and pre-exponential 
coefficient (Do) for both processes taking place in the multi-layer 
system during the annealing to be determined from curves 1 and 
2 in Figure 3. The growth parameters obtained for both phases

For the second type of specimen (one Cu/Ti bi-layer) the 
quantity of the intermetallic phase formed after each annealing 
was measured by the anode dissolving method. 
Figure 4 shows the experimental dissolution time dependence 
of current density in various annealing conditions. Curve 1 illus-

ing. The first stage corresponds to the complete dissolution of 
the Cu layer, while the second to the Ti one. After isothermal 
annealing of the system (curves 2,3 and 4) two new stages appear, 
whose length increases with the annealing time. The new stages 
correspond to the dissolution of P-Cu,Ti and y-CuTi phases. On 
curve 4 a new stage does not appear, showing that the free Ti f.3

The total amount of electricity necessary for the dissolution of 
the system before and after annealing was found to be always 
approximately equal. This fact confirms the conception cor- 
rectness for “the effective” thicknesses, on which basis the pro- 
portionality coefficients c+cuT1 and aB.Cu,T, were determined. 
The thickness growth of y-CuTi and p-Cu,Ti phases in the bi- 
layer system as a function of the time of interdiffusion in the 
phases is shown in Figure 5. Table 2 consists of the interdiffusion 
coefficients determined by the curves slope in Figure 5. 
The results in Table 2 were used to construct curves 3 and 4 in 
Figure 3. According to Arrhenius’ equation (6) using the graphic 
dependences constructed, the parameters (E and 0) charac- 
terizing the intermetallic phase formation were determined :

that in the system in these cases free Ti is absent. This leads to a 
decrease and stopping the y-CuTi phase growth and its sub- 
sequent spending according to the reaction : Cu + y-CuTi --f /I- 
Cu,Ti. 
Investigating the reactive diffusion in the “solid” Cu-Ti system 
in the range 75&85O”C the formation and simultaneous increase 
of the intermetallic compounds Cu,Ti, (Cu,Ti), CujTi2, Cu,Ti,, 
CuTi and CuTi, have been established. According to the state 
diagram of the system published in Ref. 12 these compounds are 
stable even at room temperature. In other investigations of thin- 
film systems’m3 in all cases in the diffusion zone Cu3Ti2 and Cu,Ti, 
phases are absent. This absence should not be considered as proof 
of a disturbed local quasi-equilibrium. Probably these phases are 
present in the system, but because of the small interdiffusion 
coefficient and narrow areas of homogeneity, their amount is 
such that at certain experimental conditions they can not be 
registered. The partial diffusion coefficients of Cu and Ti in 
CuTi? and Cu,Ti, phases at 850°C have been determined by 
another author.’ For both phases, the Cu diffusion is of nearly 
an order larger than that of Ti. We do not have such data for the 
low-temperature diffusion in the thin-film system, but on the 
basis of the present results and those from we can suppose that 
in this case copper is also the main diffusion element. 
4. Conclusions 
The growth kinetics of y-CuTi and /I-Cu,Ti phases in two types 
of thin-film system, multi-layer system with 21 bi-layers and a bi- 
layer one, in the ranges 30&4OO”C and 37&47O”C has been 
investigated. By means of a quantitative X-ray analysis in the 
first case and an electrochemical anode dissolving method in the 
second, the phase amount was determined. In both cases the 
intermetallic phase formation goes in two stages: the diffusion 
of Cu and Ti atoms through the growing phases is the slower 
one, while the quicker is a rearrangement of the atoms in a new 
lattice on the respective interphase boundaries. In the first place 
the diffusion of Cu atoms defines the phase growth. The effective 
interdiffusion coefficients for both phases have been determined. 
The values of the activation energy for the formation of both 
intermetallic phases calculated in the two temperature ranges 
differ slightly. Probably this distinction is not due to a difference 
of diffusion mechanism, since the systems investigated are similar 
and the temperature ranges are close. It is most likely that the 
distinction is due to the different precision of the methods used 
for measuring the amount of the intermetallic phases formed.
