Abstract 
Pulsed laser deposition is a recently developed technique which is producing very good results for the growth of complex 
compound films. This work reviews some results obtained so far in the application of this technique to grow oxide films for 
optical applications. The high density of PLD films and the role of a gas environment on the film homogeneity, composition 
and optical properties are illustrated with various examples. 
1. Introduction 
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a recently developed 
technique which became very fashionable after its success 
in producing high critical temperature superconducting 
thin films in the late 80s [1,2]. The simplicity and versatil- 
ity of the technique make it very attractive when compared 
to more conventional deposition techniques. As seen in 
Fig. 1, a pulsed laser beam is focused onto the surface of a 
target (usually at 45”) located into a vacuum chamber. A 
visible plasma is produced which is mainly formed by 
electrons, ions and neutrals with energies in the range 
l-100 eV [3,4]. Although the presence of this high ener- 
getic species makes PLD comparable to some extent to 
sputtering or ion assisted deposition techniques, its ability 
to produce epitaxial films is much higher [3]. The process 
is considered as “stoichiometric” since it transfers the 
composition of the target to the deposited film thus making 
it very suitable for the deposition of complex structures, 
such as oxides. When ablation takes place in the presence 
of a foreign gas, the plasma expansion follows a complex 
kinetics 15-81, and most of the plasma expansion models 
suggest that the optimum distance to set the substrate is 
similar to the length of the plasma [9] (typically 30-40 
mm when working in the presence of a gas environment). 
PLD can be carried out either in ultra high vacuum 
conditions or in high pressure environments, both inert and 
reactive [3]. The target has no specific electrical, cooling 
or geometrical constraints as it usually happens in more 
conventional techniques like sputtering [ 101. Nevertheless, 
the way the target is prepared has a great influence on the 
particulate content of the final film, the use of very dense 
and/or bulk targets (as opposed to sintered targets) lead-

often observed in PLD films thus limiting their widespread 
application [ 1 I]. Several schemes have been proposed for 
reducing their density in the films, the use of a shutter 
triggered by the laser to stop the slow particles being 
among the earliest and most efficient proposed solutions 
[12]. The fundamental and practical aspects of PLD to- 
gether with its application to some important technological 
materials and an updated materials survey have been re- 
cently reviewed elsewhere [ 131. 
2. Oxide films for optical applications 
Optical applications require high density films with a 
very good adhesion, both requirements have been better 
achieved in the past by sputtering and ion assisted tech- 
niques. Depending on the particular application, other 
properties as low absorption (waveguides) and epitaxial/ 
well oriented films (ferroelectric films for non-linear opti- 
cal applications) are also needed. Some reviews have been 
published on the application of PLD to optics [ 14- 161. The 
oxide materials prepared so far by PLD which may be 
relevant for optical applications have been divided into 
three groups [16]: binary oxides, complex oxides and 
composite glasses. 
The first group includes not only those oxides which 
have been used as optical coatings since very long, but 
also some transparent and conducting materials which can 
be suitable layers for contacts in electro-optical applica- 
tions or some oxides which are interesting as buffer layers 
for the growth of more complex structures. The materials 
grown so far by PLD include among others CeO,, GeO,, 
HfO,, ITO, MgO, SiO,, SnO,, Y203, ZnO, ZrO, . . . . In 
most of the cases, the refractive index is reported in 
addition to the characterization of the structural and com- 
positional properties of the films. The results show that

dense films with refractive index close to that of the bulk 
materials are usualiy obtained at room temperature. 
The complex oxide group includes materials which are 
usually available as bulk single-crystals that show interest- 
ing non-linear optical (NLO) properties. Although several 
materials have been studied in terms of the growth condi- 
tions to produce epitaxial films, their NLO properties have 
been only studied in the case of Bi,Ti,O,, [ 171, KTN [ 181, 
KTP [19], LiNbO, [20], and (Pb,La)@r,Ti)O, films [21]. 
Nevertheless, a complete layered system for a longitudinal 
electro-optic modulator was identified and successfully 
prepared by PLD [18], that includes a SrRuO, bottom 
electrode layer, a KTN electro-optic layer and a transpar- 
ent IT0 top electrode layer. These promising results should 
strengthen the investigation of the optical and NLO proper- 
ties of this interesting group of materials prepared by PLD. 
Finally, the composite glasses group is an emergent 
field of research with a high potential for the development 
of both active and passive planar waveguides for photonic 
applications. CdTe microcrystallites embedded in a SiO, 
matrix were produced by alternative laser ablation of CdTe 
and SiO targets in argon and oxygen environments. The 
resulting films had a very high NLO figure of merit and a 
decay time (< 10 ps) much faster than that ever reported 
for semiconductor-doped glasses 1221. More recently, 
rare-earth (Er-Yb) doped phosphate glass waveguides have 
been successfully prepared by PLD [23], and show lumi- 
nescence at 1.5 pm [24]. 
The aim of this work is to show that PLD is an 
attractive technique for optical applications. The high den- 
sity of PLD films is shown through several examples and 
results obtained during ablation of a single element target 
in an oxygen pressure will be used to illustrate the use of 
PLD as a reactive technique. The presence of a gas 
environment has a crucial role on the plasma expansion 
kinetics and therefore, on the film growth mechanisms, 
thus affecting the film homogeneity, stoichiometry and 
optical properties. Some examples will be discussed in 
order to evidence that the experimental conditions have to 
be thoroughly studied for each particular material in order 
to achieve the desired properties. 3. Experimental details 405 
The’ results presented were obtained using an ArF laser, 
which delivers 12 ns p&es at 193 nm. The laser beam was 
focused at 4.5” onto a rotating target, the average energy 
density at the target site being in the range l-4 J/cm*. 
The films are deposited onto silicon or glass substrates 
hold at room temperature either in vacuum (4 X lo-* or 
8 X low6 mbar) or in a gas environment up to pressures of 
lo- ’ mbar. A He-Ne laser beam (633 nm) is used to 
record in real time the evolution of the reflectivity and/or 
the transmission of the substrate as the film grows. The 
simulation of the experimental data leads to the determina- 
tion of the refractive index and the film thickness [25]. In 
some cases, the refractive index was also determined by 
spectroscopic ellipsometry [26,27]. The film composition 
was determined by combining rutherford backscattering 
(RBS) and nuclear reaction (NRA) techniques [28-3 11. 
4. PLD as a technique to produce high density films 
Fig. 2 shows the void fraction of electron-beam, DC- 
sputtered and PLD Ge films as a function of the film 
thickness and determined from ellipsometric measurements 
using a thick DC-sputtered film as a reference 1261. It is 
clearly seen that PLD and DC-sputtered films are very 
similar, the former being slightly denser than the latter. 
The figure also shows the void fraction of an electron-beam 
deposited film with and without ion bombardment from an 
independent experiment [32]. The data included correspond 
to the best improvement of the void fraction reported 
which was achieved for an Ar+ ion energy of 70 eV. 
When!comparing the two sets of data, one has to take into 
account that the references used are different and therefore

406 CN. Afonso, J. Gonzalo/Nucl. Insrr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B 116 (1996) 404-409 
only the relative decrease in the void fraction can be 
compared. These results evidence that those techniques 
involving species bombardment (PLD, DC sputtering and 
ion assisted) in the range lo-100 eV lead to lower void 
fractions (higher density), PLD films being always slightly 
denser. 
When ablation of Ge is performed in the presence of a 
reactive atmosphere as oxygen, incorporation of oxygen 
atoms to the film during growth occurs and therefore GeO, 
films can be easily produced. Fig. 3 shows the oxygen to 
germanium ratio of PLD films grown by ablation of a Ge 
target as a function of the oxygen pressure applied during 
deposition [27]. The amount of oxygen incorporated in- 
creases very rapidly for pressures in the range 10m4 - lo-’ 
mbar, films grown for pressures higher than 5 X lop3 
mbar having the composition of the stoichiometric oxide 
(X = 2). The real and imaginary parts of the refractive 
index of the films determined from spectral ellipsometry 
measurements were found to decrease as the oxygen pres- 
sure applied during deposition increases [27]. The imagi- 
nary part (k) of the refractive index, which is related to the 
film absorption, is also plotted in Fig. 3. It is clearly seen 
that the films become transparent (k = 0.03) when the film 
composition approaches that of GeO,. The density of these 
films was evaluated using the data earlier reported for 
amorphous GeO, as a reference [33], and the results 
showed that the GeO, films prepared by PLD are 8-15% 
denser than the reference. These results evidence that PLD 
films are also very dense when the technique is used in a 
reactive mode. 
The selection of the target composition can be very 
critical on the optical quality and homogeneity of PLD 
films. GeO, films have been also prepared by laser abla- 
tion of a GeO, target [34]. The films were found to have a 
slightly lower refractive index and a larger fraction of 
voids than those of films grown from a Ge target [27]. 
Furthermore, the optical properties of the films were found 
to vary as moving away from the center of the deposit and 
these changes were related to inhomogeneities in composi-

tion. The films grown from a Ge target were instead found 
to be homogeneous in the film plane [29]. 
5. The role of an oxygen pressure 
When growing oxide films, the use of a partial oxygen 
pressure is usually required in order to produce films with 
the desired properties even when targets containing oxygen 
are used. Nevertheless, the role of this environment is not 
yet clear since it is often found to depend on the specific 
material to be ablated or in the target composition as 
described above for the case of GeO, films. The problem 
becomes even more complex when compound targets are 
used. In order to illustrate further this point, Fig. 4 shows 
the composition of films grown by ablation of a single 
crystal LiNbO, target together with the imaginary part (k) 
of their refractive index as a function of the oxygen 
pressure applied during deposition [28]. When comparing 
Figs. 3 and 4, the main difference lies on the fact that 
whereas the oxygen content of the films increases as the 
oxygen pressure increases in the case of ablation of Ge, 
similar oxygen and lithium to niobium ratios are obtained 
for pressures up to = 6 x lop2 mbar in the case of 
ablation of LiNbO,. The sharp decrease of the imaginary 
part of the refractive index (k) as the oxygen pressure 
increases cannot be thus related to a composition change in 
the case of LiNbO,. The high value of k for films grown 
in vacuum has been most likely related to the formation of 
oxygen vacancies, the concentration of which is reduced as 
an oxygen pressure is applied 1281. This interpretation was 
based on the fact that the presence of defects and oxygen 
vacancies in LiNbO, crystals are known to lead to strong 
absorption in the visible. A similar absorption was ob- 
served in PLD films deposited in vacuum which was 
notably reduced once the films were annealed in an oxy- 
gen environment [25]. 
The presence of an oxygen atmosphere has been 
demonstrated so far necessary to produce low absorbing

oxide films, but the question which arises is whether the 
atmosphere has to he necessarily oxygen or it can he other 
gas. Fig. 5a shows the oxygen to cations ratio measured in 
films grown in vacuum and in the presence of inert (argon) 
and reactive (oxygen) gas environments, during ablation of 
a Bi,Sr,Ca,Cu,O, target [301. The oxygen content of 
these films is observed to increase in the presence of a gas 
environment no matter of its inert or reactive character 
thus producing composition changes. Since in the case of 
an argon pressure no oxygen can be incorporated from the 
atmosphere, these results suggest that the processes occur- 
ring in the gas phase before deposition are crucial in 
determining the film composition. Besides, reactions be- 
tween the foreign gas and the ablated species can be ruled 
out in the case of an inert (argon) environment. Therefore, 
the scattering of the ablated species by the gas species 
prior to deposition, i.e. collisional processes, has to be 
responsible of the increase of the oxygen content observed 
in Fig. 5a for films grown in the presence of a gas 
pressure. Furthermore, the scattering effects are found to 
depend critically on the mass and collisional cross section 
of the different elements forming the target as discussed 
elsewhere [30,31]. To illustrate this, Figs. 5b and 5c show 
the oxygen to Ca and Bi ratios, which are the lightest and 
heaviest elements in the target. It is clearly seen that, although both ratios follow similar trends, the increase of 
the oxygen content in respect to the light element is much 
higher than that in respect to the heavy element when 
ablation is performed in a gas pressure. Light species with 
a high collisional cross section like Ca suffer significant 
deviations during the plasma expansion whereas heavy 
species like Bi suffer little deviation. The increase ob- 
served in the oxygen to Ca ratio in a gas environment has 
thus to be mainly related to a decrease of the number of Ca 
species reaching the target due to scattering processes. 
Figs. .5d-5f show the same ratios measured in PLD films 
grown in vacuum and oxygen during ablation of a LiNbO, 
target [28]. The same result is again obtained, riamely the 
oxygen to light element (Li) ratio increases sharply when 
ablation occurs in an oxygen pressure whereas the oxygen 
to heavy element @lb) ratio in this case tends even to 
decrease. 
Several mechanisms have been proposed in the litera- 
ture to explain the composition deviations observed during 
PLD in the presence of a foreign gas: the preferential 
evaporation of the most volatile component from the sub- 
strate [35], the re-sputtering of some of the components 
from the substrate [36,37] or the scattering processes tak- 
ing place prior to deposition as described above. Since the 
two first mechanisms involve ejection of species from the 
growing film, they will be referred to hereafter as re-emis- 
sion processes. In order to analyze whether re-emission or

scattering processes are the dominant mechanism, an ex- 
periment with a second substrate (SR) located in the 
chamber facing the growing film (substrate S) was per- 
formed (Fig. 6a). The material reaching substrate SR can 
be produced either by re-emission from substrate S or as a 
result of scattering processes produced by the gas species. 
If the facing substrate (S) is removed, the material de- 
posited on the non-facing substrate (SG, Fig. 6b) can be 
only produced by the latter process. The number of de- 
posited atoms on the substrate facing the target (S) and the 
non-facing substrate at the re-emission (SR) and scattering 
(SG) configurations are shown in Figs. 6c-6e for films 
deposited in vacuum and oxygen or argon pressures [3 1,381. 
It is clearly seen that very little deposition occurs in 
vacuum in the non-facing substrates thus proving that both 
re-emission and scattering effects are nearly negligible. 
The results show that re-emission effects may affect up to 
3% of the total number of atoms in the deposited material 
at the most. When a gas is present, a dramatic increase of 
the amount of material deposited on the non-facing sub- 
strates occurs, this increase being even higher when the 
facing substrate (S) is removed (SG configuration) and the 
gas is argon. These results show clearly that the dominant 
composition altering mechanism is the scattering of the 
ablated species by the foreign gas species, this mechanism 
being more important for the lighter species [31,38]. 
6. Summary 
Pulsed laser deposition produces films with high den- 
sity and it is therefore a very promising technique to 
produce oxide films for both linear and non-linear optical 
applications. A gas environment is usually required to 
produce low absorbing films but it may introduce some 
undesired deviations in the composition and/or homo- 
geneity of the films mainly due to the scattering of the 
ablated species by the foreign gas species prior to deposi- 
tion. Therefore, the experimental conditions have to be 
carefully determined for each particular material in order 
to achieve the desired properties.
