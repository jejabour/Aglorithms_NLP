Abstract 
We have succeeded in preparing single crystalline C, thin film of a lateral extension in the order of several millimeters 
on mica by ionized cluster beam (ICB) deposition. During the growth process, planar dendrite-like single crystalline islands 
were observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM). It was concluded from reflection high-energy electron diffraction 
(RHEED) and transmission electron diffraction (TED) analyses that these islands grow hetero-epitaxially on mica. As the 
deposition process continues, the single crystalline islands coalesce and finally form a giant single crystal without grain 
boundaries between the former islands. This layered dendrite-like crystal growth is considered to be due to the ICB process, 
namely, ionizing molecules and accelerating them. Furthermore, the effect of ion (P’, B+, Ar+> implantation into C,, thin 
films on the molecular structure and the conductivity has been studied under various implantation conditions. It was found 
from the analyses of IT-IR and Raman spectroscopies that the soccer-ball-like structure of C, changes into a diamond-like 
carbon (DLC) structure with an implantation energy higher than 40 keV, whereas the structure undergoes virtually no change 
with 10 keV implantation. As for conductivity changes under the lower implantation energy condition, the minimum dose of 
P+ ions required to increase the conductivity from the non-doped value (lo’* cm-*) is 10 times lower than in the case of 
Arf implantation. The conductivity change for the P+ . implantation could be explained satisfactorily not only by the effect 
of chemically-modified C, but also by the effect of a charge-transfer state between C,, and implanted ions. It was 
concluded from these results that the conductivity of the C, film can be controlled over a wide range based on the carrier 
generation mechanism, which depends on the implantation conditions. 
1. Introduction 
Since the large-scale production method of C,, fullerene 
was established [ 11, studies of Cm have progressed rapidly 
in wide areas of science and technology. From the view- 
point of the application of C, to electronic materials, 
preparing high-quality thin films and controlling their elec- 
tronic properties is of great importance. 
As for thin film formation, it was reported that C,, thin 
films deposited on sapphire [2], CaF, [3], Si [4] and NaCl 
[S] substrates take on a polycrystalline, face-centered cubic 
(fee) crystal structure and those deposited on mica [6,7] 
and MoS, [8] grow hetero-epitaxially to form an fee 
structure with (111) orientation normal to the substrates.

2188, e-mail isoda@hat.hon.melco.co.jp. The quality of C,, thin films, however, has been unsatis- 
factory for the study of their electronic properties in terms 
of the size of the crystallite: several pm for polycrystalline 
films and several hundreds of nm for epitaxial growth 
films. 
With regard to conductivity, alkali metal doped C,, 
shows various conductivities ranging from insulator to 
metal-like to superconductor [9- 11 I. Though these proper- 
ties may lead to new functional electronic devices, this 
conductivity cannot be controlled under atmospheric con- 
ditions. Therefore, the stable control of conductivity is 
now under investigation. 
Along these lines, we have been investigating the for- 
mation of C,, thin films as well as their electronic proper- 
ties [12,13]. This paper deals with the preparation of a C,, 
single crystalline thin film and the effect of the ion implan- 
tation into the film on conductivity and molecular struc- 
ture.

2. Experimental 
C, powder with a purity of more than 99.9% was 
purchased from Texas Fullerene Corp. and used as deposi- 
tion source material. The C 6. powder was loaded into a 
graphite crucible with a 2 mm diameter nozzle and evapo- 
rated at 550-600°C after a degassing procedure. The C,, 
molecular beam effusing through the nozzle was ionized 
by an electron beam and accelerated the ionized C, 
molecules to the substrate. The ICB source was specially 
designed for organic material deposition taking account of 
both the location of the ionizing filaments and the radia- 
tion shield in order to avoid the degradation of molecules 
and to maintain the crucible at a constant temperature 
during deposition. The ICB deposition conditions were 
fixed at an acceleration voltage of V,: 500 V, an ionization 
voltage of Vi: 60 V, and an ionization current of Ii: 60 
mA. The ionization ratio, that is the ratio of the number of 
ionized molecules to the total number of molecules, is 
estimated to be 0.23% when li is 60 mA. The deposition 
rate was 1-2 nm/min and cleaved mica (1 cm X 1 cm) 
was used as a substrate. Two types of chamber were used 
for the film deposition. One was evacuated by a turbo- 
molecular pump (background pressure: 2 X IO-’ Torr), 
the other was a UHV chamber (background pressure: 10e9 
Torr) with a substrate prebaking chamber. Ion implantation 
was carried out with 40 keV apparatus at Ion Engineering 
Center Corp. (IECC). Structural characterization of ICB 
deposited thin films and ion-implanted films were per- 
formed with the following apparatus: transmission electron 
microscope (TEM) and transmission electron diffraction 
(TED): JEOL JEM-4OOOEX and JEOL JEM-20OOFX; 
atomic force microscope (AIM): DI nanoscope II and III; 
secondary ion mass spectroscope (SIMS): CAMECA IMS- 
3F; IT-IR: JEOL JIR-100; Raman scattering: JOBIN 
YVON RAMANOR U-1000 (IECC). The electrical prop- 
erties of ICB deposited films and ion-implanted films were 
measured in vacuum with an ammeter (HP414OB) in con- 
junction with a cryostat (ULVAC CRYO-UlOPU2). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Preparation of C,, single crystalline thin jilm 
During the ICB growth process of C, deposition, 
planar dendrite-like islands were observed by AFM (Fig. 
la). A TED pattern (Fig. lb) obtained from these 
dendrite-like islands shows fee (111) diffraction spots ar- 
ranged in an identical direction over wide areas of observa- 
tion. This means that these dendrite-like islands are epitax- 
ially-grown crystallites, which was also supported by 
RHEED analysis during deposition. As deposition process 
continued, single crystalline islands coalesced with each 
other and finally formed a giant single crystal, whose 
lateral extension was in the order of several millimeters, without grain boundaries between the former islands (Fig. 
2a). Furthermore, all the TED patterns obtained from all 
the observation areas in Cu microgrids show identical fee 
(111) orientation (Fig. 2b). This layered dendrite-like crys- 
tal growth is considered to be due to the ICB process, 
namely, ionizing molecules and accelerating them [ 141. 
3.2. Ion implantation into single crystalline C,, thin film 
Some concentration profiles of implanted ions in the 
film-thickness direction measured by SIMS are shown in 
Fig. 3. The peak is located about 20 nm from the surface 
of the film for 10 keV implantation, whereas it is about 70 
nm under 40 keV implantation. Though the effect of ion 
implantation on C,, film properties involves very compli- 
cated physico-chemical processes, the main processes are 
considered to be represented by the following scheme: 
c,+x -+ c,+c;e+c,-x+c;()-x+x.

modified C,,, respectively. C,, - X and C& - X repre-

sent charge-transfer (CT) states between C, (C&J and 
implanted ions. The CT states and chemically-modified 
C,, are considered to have a major effect on how the ion 
implantation affects the conductivity. 
The effect of the ion implantation on the chemical 
modification of the C, molecule was evaluated by FT-IR 
and Raman scattering. From FT-IR analysis, the intensity 
ratios of the peak which corresponds to the F,u(4r mode 
(1429 cm-‘) of a C, molecule [ 151 for P+ and B+ 
implanted (40 keV; lOI5 cme2) films to the C,, film 
without implantation are estimated to be. about 50% and 
15%. respectively. Fig. 4 shows the Raman scattering 
spectra of undoped and doped C,, film. As shown in Fig. 
4a, the soccer-ball-like structure of C, was found to 
change into diamond-like carbon (DLC) structure [16] at 
Fig. 3. Concentration profiles of implanted ions in the film-thick-

Dose (cm-‘)

40 keV implantation. In the case of 10 keV implantation 
(Fig. 4b1, on the other hand, the typical spectrum shape of 
a& molecule, composed of a strong peak due to an Ag 
mode (around 1465 cm-‘) and weak peaks due to Hg 
modes (1425, 1570 cm- ‘) [ 171, undergoes virtually no 
change after implantation regardless of the dose amount. 
The peak intensity, however, depends very much on the 
dose amount. Namely, the peak intensity does not change 
with a dose of lOI cm-*, whereas the peak intensity 
decreases to 20% compared to undoped film in the case of 
a lOI cm-* dose. It is concluded from these spectro- 
scopic analyses that C,, molecules in a film mostly remain 
unchanged by ion implantation with an implantation en- 
ergy of IO keV at doses of less than lOI cm-* and 
become chemically-modified at the higher dose level of 
lot6 cmW2 as well as with the higher implantation energy 
of more than 40 keV. 
Based on the above structural estimation, the effect of 
ion implantation on conductivity was studied with an 
implantation energy of 10 keV in order to prevent the 
complete loss of electronic properties of the C, thin film. 
In order to clarify the effect of the CT state, the electrical 
properties of Pt ion implanted films were investigated in 
comparison with those of Ar + ion implanted films, be- 
cause the Ar+ ions are inert for the formation of the CT 
state. Typical results of the conductivity versus dose is 
shown in Fig. 5. As shown in the figure, the minimum 
dose (IO I2 cm- 2, of P+ ions required to increase the 
conductivity from the undoped value is 10 times lower 
than in the case of Arf implantation. This discrepancy in 
the conductivity change is assumed to be due to the 
formation of the CT state (C,, - X and/or C& - Xl in 
the case of P+ implantation, because the effect of the 
increase of the conductivity due to C& formation by P’ 
implantation is considered to be virtually identical with (or less than) the case of the Ar+ implantation from the 
comparison of the stopping power between both ion 
species. In order to analyze the conduction mechanism, the 
temperature dependence of the resistivity was evaluated 
for both ion implanted films (Figs. 6 and 7). As shown in 
the figures, the films implanted by Ar+ ions and P+ ions 
with high dosages (lOI cm-*) fit the plot of the resistiv- 
ity vs. (l/r)‘/4 well over a wide range of temperatures. 
This result means that the conduction mechanism for both 
cases can be interpreted by the variable range hopping 
(VRH) model [18]. Furthermore, this result corresponds 
well with the case of Xe+ implantation [19]. On the other 
hand, the film implanted by P+ ions with lOi cm-’ dose

fits neither the VRH plot (Fig. 6b) nor the Arrhenius plot 
(Fig. 6a). In this case, two types of conduction mechanism, 
an activation process in the temperature range around 
room temperature, and a VRH process in the lower tem- 
perature range, are thought to be involved in the electrical 
properties of the implanted film. When considering the 
structural studies described above, it is possible to con- 
clude that for P+ implantation the conductivity in the dose 
range from 10” to 1Or4 cm-* is mainly controlled by the 
CT state, which results in the activation process, and that 
in the higher dose range it is mainly controlled by hopping 
centers which are produced by chemically-modified C,,. It 
was thus concluded from these results that the conductivity 
of the C, film can be controlled over a wide range based 
on the carrier generation mechanism which depends on the 
implantation conditions.
