Abstract-The beneficial effect of the addition of yttrium by ion implantation on the oxidation behaviour of 
chromium has been studied. Emphasis was placed on the initial stages of oxidation during rapid heating to 900°C by 
exposing samples to intermediate temperatures and withdrawing them for analysis. Characterization of the surface 
layers was carried out with two X-ray techniques at glancing angles. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) at 
various angles was used to obtain structural and texture information as a function of depth. X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy at the yttrium K-edge enabled information to be gained on the local structure around this element. 
The short-range structure of two yttrium-rich oxides, Y203 and YCrO4, was observed. The latter is believed to 
represent the structure around yttrium segregated to the oxide grain boundaries. It is thought that this segregation 
in the chromia scales can cause many, if not all, of the reported beneficial reactive element effects. The Y203. present 
as particles, is expected to play only an indirect role by forming a source of yttrium, which slowly segregates to the 
grain boundaries. The possible effects of the grain boundary segregation of yttrium on the oxidation behaviour of 
the material and the oxide scale properties are discussed. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

INTRODUCTION 
The ability of the current generation of high-temperature alloys to resist corrosion depends 
on their potential to form and maintain a protective oxide scale, e.g. Cr203 or A1203. The 
beneficial role of reactive elements, such as yttrium, cerium and other rare earths, on the 
oxidation behaviour of high-temperature alloys has received considerable attention, see, for 
example Refs l-3. These elements added in small amounts ( < 1%) to the bulk alloy or to the 
surface are able, in particular, to decrease the oxidation rate and dramatically improve the 
scale adherence. The exact underlying mechanisms of the reactive element effect are still the 
subject of discussion. In general it is found that the influence of reactive elements is similar 
regardless of whether the element is implanted, applied as a coating or present as an alloy 
component or oxide dispersoid addition. 
Ion implantation offers the unique possibility of introducing a controlled concentration 
of an element in a thin surface layer, typically up to 100 mn thick. It has been used 
extensively for studying the mechanisms underlying the reactive element effect, e.g. Refs 3- 
7. The main effects are on the initial nucleation, growth and adherence of the corrosion 
scale. The majority of studies deal with the corrosion kinetics and the mechanical properties 
of the oxide scales, whereas the number of studies dealing with the initial stages of corrosion 
are rather limited.

In this paper the corrosion of Y-implanted chromium is reported. The study 
concentrates on the characterization of yttrium present in the as-implanted material and, 
in particular, in the oxide scales which formed initially on the material during oxidation in 
air. The changes during fast heating of a sample to 900°C were studied by heating samples to 
intermediate temperatures and withdrawing them for analysis. The effect of varying 
exposure times up to 1 h at 800°C was also included. Characterization of the surface layers 
was carried out with two X-ray techniques at glancing angles. GAXRD at various angles 
was used to obtain structural and texture information as a function of depth. X-ray 
absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure 
(EXAFS) at the yttrium K-edge were employed to gain information on the local structure 
around this element. XANES refers to the structure in the X-ray absorption coefficient in 
the immediate vicinity of the absorption edge (i.e. less than 50eV above the edge). In 
contrast to the EXAFS region the absorption coefficient in the XANES region cannot be 
described by a simple formalism. However, XANES can be very useful as a fingerprinting 
technique in which the position and shape of the edge can provide information on the 
oxidation state of the element. EXAFS is based on the oscillatory structure in the X-ray 
absorption coefficient that may be observed in the higher spectral range (40-1000 eV) above 
the absorption edge. This is caused by the interference between the outgoing photo-electron 
and its scattered component from the surrounding atoms. Factors which contribute to the 
EXAFS structure are, among others, bond distances, coordination numbers and the types 
of surrounding atoms. By interactive fitting procedures it is possible to extract this 
information from the measured EXAFS data. One of the attractive features of EXAFS is 
the fact that one can determine the local structure around each specific element 
independently. A more detailed discussion is out of the scope of this paper but is given in 
several references, e.g. Refs 8, 9. 
EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
A commercial heat of Ducropur was studied containing about 99.9% Cr, 140 ppm 0, 
24 ppm N, 130 ppm C, 15 ppm S and 14 ppm P. Coupons of approximately 20 x 20 x 2 mm 
were machined, mechanically abraded on silicon carbide paper up to 1200 grit and polished 
with alumina suspension of 0.3 pm. For final surface cleaning, the specimens were degreased 
in acetone. 
The uniform implantation of one of the principal coupon faces by yttrium, at a nominal 
dose of 10” ions/cm2, was undertaken utilizing an acceleration potential of 180 keV. 
Rutherford backscattering (RBS) indicated that the retained doses were approximately 
97% of the nominal doses. The Y distribution impla.nted in the material agreed well with 
that predicted by a depth-profile modelling programme.” This was essentially gaussian, 
with a maximum concentration of approximately 23 at% at a depth of 40 nm. The 
implantation depth was about 120 nm. 
For the short-term oxidation tests, a special autoclave system, which had been fitted with 
a magnetic introduction device, was used in order that the samples could be rapidly inserted 
and retrieved from the hot gas atmosphere. During the insertion and retrieval of the 
samples, calibrations showed that the specimen surface temperature changed by 
approximately 200”C/min. Corrosion testing was performed in flowing synthetic air, 
which was humidified up to a relative humidity of 40% at 25°C. To study the changes during 
heating to 900°C samples were heated to 400, 600, 800 and 900°C and rapidly withdrawn

upon reaching these temperatures. A second set of samples was heated to 800°C and 
withdrawn after 0,2,6 and 60 mins. 
Details of the GAXRD facility, which included a Cu K, radiation source, have been 
described elsewhere.” The geometry used was grazing incidence asymmetric Bragg (GIAB) 
with incident angles ranging from 0.3” to 2”. Fluorescence X-ray absorption spectra at the 
K-edge of the yttrium glancing angle were recorded at the wiggler station 9.3 of the 
Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, U.K. The data were recorded in fluorescence 
mode, using a 13-element solid-state detector positioned above the sample, at an incident 
angle of 0.36”, i.e. double the critical angle, corresponding to penetration depths in 
chromium of 160-200 nm. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Glancing angle X-ray diffraction 
Figure 1 shows the GAXRD spectra of the as-implanted chromium at various angles of 
incidence. The diffraction spectrum at 0.5”, corresponding to a theoretical penetration depth 
of approximately 93 nm in Cr203 and 50 nm in the base metal, indicates, besides the (1 lo), 
(200) and (211) peaks of chromium, the presence of a nanocrystalline phase indicated by the 
broad peak near 32”. On reducing the incident angle from 0.5” to 0.3”, this broad peak

indicate some preferred orientation of the material. 
The GAXRD spectra at 0.5” incident angle of the as-implanted material and the samples

contain only peaks corresponding to the chromium substrate and the YzO3 phase. To 
determine the grain size, the shape of the YzOs (440) and (622) peaks were analysed using a 
computer fitting programme,i2 assuming that the broadening was totally due to the grain 
size effect. The average Y203 grain size was determined to increase from 2.5 nm at 400°C to 
4.5 nm at 600°C. In both spectra these peaks are shifted slightly relative to the positions 
expected, which might be due to stresses in the oxide. 
An interesting aspect of the spectrum for the sample heated to 400°C and in particular 
the one at 600°C is that the chromium peaks appear to be split. To investigate this in more 
detail, spectra of the latter sample at 0.5, 1 and 2” incident angles were acquired (Fig. 3). 
With increasing angle of incidence, the splitting disappears. 
After heating to 800°C (Fig. 2), Cr203 appears in the GAXRD spectrum. Additionally, 
the broad peak has completely disappeared. The spectrum at 900°C does not show any

significant difference from the one at 8OO”C, except for a relatively lower signal from the 
underlying chromium. The chromia phase shows a significant difference in the relative 
intensities of the peaks compared to those expected, indicative of a preferred orientation. 
The GAXRD spectra at 0.5” incident angle obtained on the samples oxidized for 0,2,6 
and 60 min at 800°C are presented in Fig. 4. Again only Cr203, Y203 and Cr are observed. 
With increasing exposure times the peaks related to Cr203 become more predominant than 
those of Y203 and Cr, indicating a growing oxide layer. 
The GAXRD spectra at 0.5” incident angle obtained on the sample oxidized at 800°C for 
60 min (Fig. 4) and that heated to 900°C (Fig. 2) are rather similar. For further comparison 
of these two samples, additional spectra at a 0.3” incident angle, with a theoretical 
penetration depth of only a few nanometres in Cr203, were obtained (Fig. 5). These spectra 
are thus more representative of the outer oxide layer. In the spectra obtained on the sample 
heated to 900°C (Fig. 5(a)) the Y203 and Crz03 phases as well as the chromium substrate are 
visible, but the Cr203 predominates. In the spectra of the sample exposed for 60 min at 
800°C (Fig. 5(b)) the Y203 peaks as well as the chromium peaks have practically 
disappeared, except the one at 64.4” which is overlapped by the (300) peak from Crz03 at 
64.9”. Thus, in both cases the Y203 phase appears mainly to be located close to the metal- 
oxide interface. 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the yttrium K-edge 
The XANES regions of the X-ray absorption spectra of the oxidized samples are shown 
in Fig. 6, together with that of a YzOs reference powder. Since all of these spectra were not 
taken in the same experimental run, there is a possibility of slight shifts in the energy scale. 
However, examining the form of the spectra, it can be observed that of the various samples, 
the spectrum obtained on the sample heated to 600°C most resembles that of Y203, with 
that heated to 400°C showing a very similar curve. This can be seen both from the shape of 
the main absorption peak and from its distance to the wide peak approximately 54 eV higher 
in energy. The spectrum of the sample heated to 800°C started to differ in the structure of the 
main absorption maximum. This difference increased on prolonging the time at 800°C or on 
heating the material up to 900°C. The spectra obtained on the samples heated to 900°C and 
that heated at 800°C for 60 min are, however, very similar, indicating a similar structure in 
these two cases. These spectra, which were taken in the same experimental run as that for the 
sample heated to 800°C display a significantly lower absorption edge energy, indicating that 
the average oxidation state of the yttrium in these samples may be less than + 3. 
In EXAFS, see for example Refs 8 and 9, the oscillatory part, X(k), of the absorption 
coefficient, p(E), is extracted from the relation X(k) = (p - puo)/pO, where ~0 is a smoothly 
varying background and k = 2x/h[2m(E- I?&)] I’* Here m is the electron mass, h is Plan&s . 
constant and E. is the zero energy of the outgoing electron. In Fig. 7, typical k3-weighted 
EXAFS spectra of the implanted and oxidized samples are shown (full lines). The 
background subtracted EXAFS spectra were analysed using the least-squares fitting 
programme EXCURV92. l3 In the analysis of EXAFS results, Fourier transformation of 
the data is a particularly useful interpretation. This transformation, called the EXAFS 
radial distribution function (RDF), approximately specifies the spatial distribution of the 
backscattering atoms relative to the central atom (Fig. 7). In the first instance it was used to 
examine the EXAFS spectra for the presence of Y2O3. For this purpose EXAFS 
measurements were performed on an unstrained powder of this compound. 
The EXAFS data obtained on the sample heated to 400°C could be fitted very well with

the unstrained Y203 and the sample heated to 400°C are presented in Table 1. The 
coordination numbers in the case of the 400°C sample are significantly lower than those of 
the reference powder. Except for the second shell, the coordination number decreases with 
increasing shell number. This indicates a nanocrystalline structure. 
The fitting of the spectra obtained on all samples exposed to temperatures above 400°C 
could not be performed assuming only the presence of YzOs. Thus the presence of other

compounds, such as YCrOs and YCr04, was taken into consideration for the fitting 
procedures. Due to a lack of suitable reference compounds the accuracy in the local 
structure parameters is worse than those for the Y203 phase. The spectra for all samples 
which were heated above 400°C could be fitted successfully assuming the presence of both 
Yz03 and YCrO+ Because of much larger coordination distances in the case of YCrOs, this 
phase could not explain the observed EXAFS structures. As with Y203 the coordination 
number for YCr04 appeared to be much smaller than those expected from the 
crystallographic data (see for example Table 2).

The EXAFS spectra obtained on the samples heated to 800°C (Fig. 7(c)) and the one 
which remained an additional 2 min at this temperature (Fig. 7(e)) were rather similar. They 
could best be fitted assuming that 50% of the yttrium is present in the form of Y20s and 
50% in the form of YCr04. The determined bond lengths are slightly shorter than those of 
the crystallographic data. This reduction was approximately 2% for both phases. 
The EXAFS spectra obtained on the sample heated to 900°C (Fig. 7(d)) and that which 
was exposed for 60 min at 800°C (Fig. 7(f)) were also rather similar. The fitting of the data of 
both samples was best assuming that 34% of the yttrium is present in the form of YzOs and 
the remaining 66% in the form of YCr04. Also in these samples the reduction in the bond 
distances for Yz03 and YCr04 was about 2%. 
Table 3 presents the coordination numbers for Y203 as determined from the EXAFS 
data fitting on various specimens. Similarly, Table 4 presents those for YCr04. It can be

800°C the coordination numbers for the Y203 phase decrease, whereas those for the YCr04 
phase increase. It should be noted that coordination number determination by EXAFS has 
a relatively large error (+ 20%). The coordination numbers presented in Tables 3 and 4 
confirm that the YCr04 local structure is becoming more dominant upon increasing time 
and temperature. 
DISCUSSION 
The GAXRD results obtained on the as-implanted chromium indicate, besides some 
preferred orientation of the substrate material. the presence of a nanocrystalline phase. The 
fact that reduction of the incident angle (Fig. 1) makes the broad peak, as well as the 
chromium peaks, disappear, indicates that the phase responsible for the peak is present 
throughout the implanted region, and is not due to a surface oxide. 
In a previous study on yttrium-implanted Ni-20Cr. a similar broad peak was observed 
on initial oxidation.12 Simulations of X-ray spectra of various nanocrystalline phases 
indicated that it could have been due to Y, Y203 or NiO. EXAFS revealed the phase to be 
Yz03. In the present study the EXAFS curve of the as-implanted material could not be fitted 
to that of Y203. Thus, either a large proportion of the yttrium is not contained in this phase, 
and is thus in ‘random’ positions in the implanted region, or nanocrystalline yttrium is 
formed. Due to the very low intensity of the EXAFS oscilations observed on the as- 
implanted material, the fn-st of these possibilities is probably correct. 
These results are different from those reported in a study mainly employing TEM on 
yttrium-implanted Ni, Ni-4Cr and Ni-20Cr.14 In all materials, if the implantation dose was 
higher than 1016 ions/cm2, the implanted yttrium caused the formation of an amorphous 
phase. It was reported that the amorphization process is inherent to yttrium implantation 
and is not only induced by radiation damage effects. Further it was considered that this 
amorphous layer and its recrystallization during heating are important in the oxidation 
mechanism for the implanted alloy. Similar results on the formation of an amorphous phase 
upon yttrium implantation in Ni-20Cr have been reported in a study using glancing angle 
X-ray techniques.15 However, in the latter study a contamination by carbon during ion 
implantation could have played an important role in stabilizing the amorphous phase. It 
was reported that during oxidation recrystallization occurred and a nanocrystalline Y203 
phase appeared.15,‘6 
Oxidation of yttrium-implanted chromium 819 
Both the GAXRD and the EXAFS results indicate that upon heating to 4OO”C, 
nanocrystalline YzOs is already formed in the yttrium-implanted chromium samples. The 
GAXRD results indicate that the average grain size of the crystals increases from 2.5 to 
4.5 nm by increasing the temperature from 400 to 600°C. Interesting to note in the EXAFS 
results is the fact that the determined coordination numbers for the Yz03 phase are 
significantly lower than could be expected from the crystallographic data (Table 1). This 
difference is more pronounced with increasing shell number. This can be explained by the 
small grain sizes of the Y203 phase, as determined from GAXRD. By considering the ratio 
of volume to surface atoms for a Y203 phase with an average crystallite size of 2.5 nm, an 
estimated 80% of the atoms are either on, or are one interatomic distance away, from grain 
boundaries, which would involve a decrease of nearly 30% of the atoms in the first shell and 
about 50% in the second shell. This agrees well with the EXAFS results, taking into account 
the experimental error. The present GAXRD and EXAFS results, as well as EXAFS at the 
Cr K-edge,i7 indicate that both the chromium and the yttria lattice are distorted. Also the 
splitting of the Cr diffraction lines which can be observed on various samples (Fig. 2) can be 
attributed to this. The GAXRD results on depth profiling of the sample by changing the 
incident angle (Fig. 3) indicate that the distortion of the chromium is confined to the surface 
zone. It can be concluded that microstresses are generated by ion implantation and 
subsequent formation of the YzOs phase. 
By comparison of the GAXRD spectra obtained at 0.3 (Fig. 5) and 0.5” (Figs 2 and 4) on 
the sample heated to 900°C and that exposed for 60min at 800°C an indication of the 
position of the yttria relative to the chromia can be obtained. It appears that the chromia are 
present on the outer surface, whereas the Y203 phase is mainly located close to the metal- 
oxide interface. 
The XANES results indicate that YzOs formed upon initial heating of the sample. 
However, on raising the temperature to 800°C or above, this structure progressively 
disappeared. As stated above, the XANES curves do not give any direct information on the 
local atomic structure and can only be used to suggest the presence of a phase. On the other 
hand, by comparison of the XANES spectra with the known Y203 reference curve, it can 
definitely be stated that the samples heated at 800°C for 60 min and that raised up to 900°C 
could not contain yttrium only in the Y203 phase. It is also very important to note that the 
spectra of the latter samples displayed an edge shift to lower energies, indicating a lower 
average oxidation state of the yttrium. 
The EXAFS results also show that above 400°C another yttrium local structure is 
present in addition to YZOs. This local structure around yttrium appeared to be similar to 
that in YCr04 with reduced coordination numbers. It is interesting to note that in the 
GAXRD no indication of the presence of YCr04 was obtained. Thus, the presence of this 
phase is limited to a very short order as can be observed with EXAFS. The oxidation state of 
yttrium in YCr04 is +2,18 while in Y203 and YCrOs it is + 3. Thus the XANES and 
EXAFS results are entirely consistent with the presence of the YCr04 atomic environment 
around yttrium. 
The presence of a second yttrium-containing phase has been additionally checked by a 
comparative study with X-ray fluorescence analysis.i7 In this study, the sample exposed at 
800°C for 60 min was compared with an yttrium-implanted Ni-20Cr sample which had been 
subsequently oxidized. EXAFS studies showed that all the implanted yttrium in the Ni- 
20Cr sample was present as Y203. The total amount of yttrium in both samples was 
determined, using X-ray fluorescence analysis, to be the same within the experimental error 
820 M. J. Crist6bal et ul 
of 5-10’2~. GAXRD was performed under identical conditions on both samples. Although 
the exact quantification of the data was made difficult by a preferred orientation of the Y203 
in the case of the chromium sample, it appeared that a large proportion of the yttrium in the 
chromium sample was present in a form other than Y203. 
Curve fitting of the EXAFS spectra indicates that the coordination numbers for the 
Yz03 decrease and those of YCr04 increase with temperature from 800 to 900°C as well as 
with a longer exposure time at 800°C (Tables 3 and 4). This indicates a decrease of the 
amount of yttrium in the form of Yz03 in favour of that in the YCr04 structure with 
increasing temperature and time. Again the XANES spectra support this analysis with the 
edge shifts to lower energies being greatest for these more oxidized samples. 
From the EXAFS and XANES results it appeared that under the present experimental 
conditions no significant amount of YCr03 was formed. On the basis of extensive TEM 
studies on oxide scales, the existence of separated Y203 particles, with dimensions up to 
100 nm, in the oxide scales has been reported.4”9 Also, the presence of YCr03 particles has 
been suggested on the basis of EDX analysis, although this was not completely confirmed by 
electron diffraction.7720*21 In various TEM studies,4.7,20721 oxide grain boundary segregation 
of the yttrium has been reported. This segregation has been reported to be rather 
homogeneous over the oxide grain boundaries throughout the oxide scale. Careful 
analysis, taking into account specimen dimensions and electron beam diameter, indicated 
that the segregation might amount to a monolayer. Due to the restrictions in spatial 
resolution, the form of this segregated yttrium could not be established. In general it is 
believed that the segregation of yttrium to grain boundaries in chromia scales can cause 
many, if not all, of the beneficial effects of yttrium or yttria additions to alloys.22*23 The Y203 
or YCr03 particles are believed to play only an indirect role by forming a source of yttrium 
which is slowly segregating to the grain boundaries. 
On the basis of the present results, it can be suggested that the yttrium segregation, as 
observed by TEM in various studies, is present on the grain boundaries with a local 
structure very similar to that in YCr04. In agreement with the above-mentioned studies, the 
source of yttrium for this structure is Yz03 which is initially formed near the surface of the 
yttrium-implanted material upon heating and which is observed to grow in size upon 
heating to 600°C. Upon further heating or with longer exposure time, as the oxidation 
process proceeds, the Y2O3 possibly reacts with the Cr203. in a fashion similar to that 
suggested previously2.’ and the yttrium diffuses along the grain boundaries. It is obvious 
that the exact role of the yttrium segregation on the beneficial effects of yttrium or yttria 
additions could not be further elucidated based on these results. 
However, as has been suggested in the literature, the segregation of yttrium to the grain 
boundaries, possibly with a local structure of YCr04, as determined in the present study, 
plays a significant role and can even explain all the reactive element effects. The most 
plausible effect will be that the anion and cation transport rates along the grain boundaries 
change due to the presence of the yttrium, as has been confirmed by tracer experiments.24 
This directly changes the overall oxidation kinetics. At the same time also the 
microstructure, including grain size and possibly preferred orientations, of the oxide scales 
will change due to the changes in grain boundary transport. An additional factor might be 
that the presence of the YCr04 structure on the grain boundaries might also inhibit oxide 
grain growth. Besides a thinner oxide thickness due to slower oxidation kinetics, associated 
changes in microstructure can contribute to the improved scale adherence. Related to this, 
the presence of the YCr04 structure on the grain boundaries can directly influence the 
Oxidation of yttrium-implanted chromium 821 
mechanical properties of the oxide scale, for example, by changing the viscosity of the oxide 
grain boundaries or by acting as crack blocking boundaries. However, beside these effects 
caused by the grain boundary segregation, other processes might play a role. For example, 
the initially formed Yz03 might very well alter the nucleation of Cr203. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Yttrium implantation in chromium possibly induces the formation of a nanocrystalline 
phase. GAXRD examination of samples simulating the heating of a sample up to 900°C 
showed that above 400°C Yz03 is formed. The Yz03 particles, with sizes in the nanometre 
range, grow on an increase in temperature to 600°C. Upon further heating, the surface starts 
to be dominated by Crz03 scale formation. EXAFS examinations show that part of the 
yttrium in the samples heated above 400°C is present in a structure other than that of Y203. 
X-ray fluorescence analysis and evaluation of the XANES data strongly support this 
conclusion. This structure could best be described by an atomic environment very similar to 
that in YCr04. The relative amount of yttrium present in the structure of YCr04 relative to 
that of Y203 increases with increasing temperature and exposure time. The initially formed 
Y203 appears to react with the Cr203 to form a local YCr04 structure. It is concluded that 
this is the local atomic environment of yttrium associated with the yttrium grain boundary 
segregation reported in several TEM studies. 
It is believed that the segregation of yttrium to grain boundaries in the chromia scales 
can cause many, if not all, of the reported beneficial reactive element effects. The Y203 
particles present are believed to play only an indirect role by forming a source of yttrium, 
which is slowly segregating to the grain boundaries. Due to the presence of yttrium with the 
local structure of YCr04 at the grain boundaries, the anion and cation transport rates along 
the grain boundaries are changed, thus influencing the overall oxidation kinetics. At the 
same time the microstructure, including grain size and possibly preferred orientation, of the 
oxide scale will be affected due to the alteration in grain boundary transport. An additional 
factor could be that the presence of the YCr04 structure at the grain boundaries might also 
inhibit oxide grain growth. Besides a thinner oxide thickness due to slower oxidation 
kinetics, the changes in microstructure can contribute to the improved scale adherence. 
Related to this effect, the presence of the YCr04 structure at the grain boundaries can 
directly influence the mechanical properties of the oxide scale, for example, by changing the 
viscosity of the oxide grain boundaries or by acting as crack blocking boundaries. However, 
besides these effects caused by the grain boundary segregation, additional processes might 
play a role. For example, the initially formed YZ03 might well alter the nucleation of Cr203 
grains.
