Abstract 
Thin films of ZnTe were deposited on glass and Si by pulsed laser ablation at substrate temperatures of 26°C and 286°C. 
X-ray diffraction studies showed that films deposited at 26°C were amorphous and those deposited at 286°C were 
polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy @F’S) showed the Zn : Te ratio to be 49.1 : 50.9 for both types of films. 
The band gap of the films deposited at 286°C was 2.2 eV. The conductivity of the films was 1.09 X 10-j 0-l cm”’ and 
2.59 X 10e6 R-’ cm-’ respectively at 300 K. The variation of conductivity with temperature and the properties of 
ZnTe/Si heterojunctions were also studied.

1. Introduction 
ZnTe is a wide-band gap II-VI semiconductor 
with a band gap of 2.26 eV at 300 K. High quality 
ZnTe films along with its alloys such as Cd,Zn, _,Te 
and ZnSe,Te, _-x have considerable potential in opto- 
electronics and integrated optics [l-3]. Recently, 
ZnTe is being used in making graded contacts to 
p-ZnSe for blue laser fabrication [4]. ZnTe and its 
alloys may effectively be used in CdTe based solar 
cells, in which stable contact formation is always a 
problem. Use of ZnTe as a contact layer in an n-i-p 
structure is very effective in producing high effi- 
ciency devices [5]. Polycrystalline ZnTe films were 
also used in a tandem solar cell structure which 
utilizes Cd,Zn, _,Te as the absorber material with a 
tailored band gap of 1.7 eV [61. ZnTe has also been

Te/ZnTe quantum well structures. This has created 
renewed interest in the studies of ZnTe films for 
device applications. 
Among the various techniques reported so far for 
the deposition of ZnTe, molecular beam epitaxy 
(MBE), liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), sequential elec- 
trodeposition, RF sputtering [7], thermal evaporation 
[8] and hot wall evaporation [9] are important. Laser 
evaporation has emerged as a viable thin film deposi- 
tion technique in recent years. The interaction of 
high-power laser radiation with matter results in 
emission of particles with high kinetic energy result- 
ing in films with good structural and chemical prop- 
erties. Congruent rapid evaporation, very small depo- 
sition time and precise control of deposition rate are 
the important advantages of this technique. Encour- 
aging results include deposition of dielectrics [IO], 
semiconductor superlattices [ 11 I and high tempera- 
ture superconductors [ 121. Bhattacharya et al. [ 131

have reported laser deposition of CdTe films on Si 
for heterojunction studies. They found that pulsed 
laser ablation gave films with better properties at a 
given substrate temperature than thermal evapora- 
tion. (1111 
The present work describes the deposition of ZnTe 
thin films on glass and Si by pulsed laser evapora- 
tion at two substrate temperatures viz. 26°C and 
286°C followed by characterization of the deposited 
films. The composition of the films was checked by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The crystal 
structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
studies. The band gap was estimated from optical 
absorption of films deposited on glass substrates. 
Heterojunctions of p-ZnTe/n-Si were fabricated and 
characterized by current-voltage (Z-V) and capaci- 
tance-voltage (C-V) (1 MHz) techniques, from 
which the ideality factor and the band discontinuity 
were deduced. (220)

2. Experimental method and results 
Laser evaporation was carried out at a background 
pressure of 4 X 1O-6 Tot-r. The target used was a 
ZnTe pellet made from ZnTe powder (Zn and Te 
were of 6Ns purity) synthesized in our laboratory. 
This was done by first reacting the elements at 
750°C for 12 h in an evacuated fused silica ampoule. 
The material was then heated to the melting point of 
1300°C in an RF furnace followed by directional 
solidification. A pulsed Ruby laser (A = 694 nm> 
with a pulse duration of 30 ns, energy density of 2.5 
J cm-* and beam diameter 0.8 cm. was used for 
ablation. The films were deposited on a (100) ori- 
ented n+--n Si substrate (n = 1.5 X 1015 cmp3) and 
on Corning 7059 glass at 26°C and 286°C. The latter 
temperature is the theoretical optimum according to 
Vincett et al. [14] being T,,/3, where T,, is the 
boiling point of ZnTe in K. 1.2- 1.4 pm as determined by a surfometer giving a 
deposition rate of 108 A per pulse. This compares 
with a deposition rate of 500 A per pulse obtained 
for CdTe [13]. This is mainly due to lower band gap 
of CdTe (1.5 eV> which gives much higher optical 
absorption coefficient OL at 694 nm. 
X-ray diffraction spectra given in Fig. 1 showed 
that the films were amorphous when deposited at 
26°C and polycrystalline at 286°C substrate tempera- 
ture. In the latter case the films had preferential 
orientation along (111) and (220) withOzincblende 
structure and lattice parameter = 6.104 A in agree- 
ment with the literature. From the full width at half 
maximum of the XRD spectra, the grain size was 
determined to be 323-363 .& for the films deposited 
at 286°C. The stoichiometry of the deposited films 
was determined by XPS using the 2p,,, peak for Zn 
and 3d 5,2 peak for Te which were the most intense 
peaks. This showed that the films were slightly rich 
in Te (Zn : Te = 49.1 : 50.9) for both substrate tem- 
peratures. 
The glass substrates were first cleaned in acetone Optical absorption was carried out in a Shimadzu 
and then dipped in chromic acid for 24 h and then (UV 365) spectrometer for films deposited on glass 
washed thoroughly several times in deionized water, substrates and is shown in Fig. 2. An absorption

substrates were rotated slowly between pulses in obtained for the films deposited at 286°C but no 
order to ensure homogeneous films. The distance sharp absorption edge was found for the films de- 
between the target and substrate was kept at 4 cm. posited at 26°C.

Resistivity measurements showed that the ZnTe 
films had low conductivity at 300 K with u = 2.59 
X 10e6 a-’ cm-’ and 1.09 X low3 R-’ cm-’ for 
26°C and 286°C deposited films respectively. The 
latter films had higher conductivity because of crys- 
tallinity resulting in higher mobility and larger free 
carrier concentration. Fig. 3 shows the variation of

For heterojunction studies, ZnTe dots were de- 
posited on n+-n Si through metal masks. Ohmic 
contact was made by thermal evaporation of gold 
followed by annealing at 180°C for 4 mm in argon 
atmosphere. Typical Z-V characteristics of laser de- 
posited junctions at substrate temperatures of 26°C 
and 286°C are shown in Fig. 4. Both junctions 
showed rectifying behavior. The rectification ratio at 
V = 1 V was 65 for films deposited at 26°C while it 
was 170 for the films deposited at 286°C. The ideal- 
ity factors were calculated from the slope of the In I 
vs V curves and were found to be 8.4 and 4.1 for the 
films deposited at 26°C and 286°C respectively. Bet- 
ter ideality factor for the films of 286°C substrate 
temperature implied that the interface was of better 
quality with lower generation-recombination cur- 
rent. This is an advantage of laser deposited films

compared with thermally deposited or hot wall de- 
posited films which become non-stoichiometric and 
highly resistive at higher substrate temperatures. 
The C-V characteristics of the junctions were 
measured using a Keithly 590 C-V analyzer (Fig. 
5). The barrier height was determined by use of the 
following relation: 
1 2( N*e* + N,%) 
c:,= qN,N2e,e* (Vn-v>~ 
where suffix 1 stands for ZnTe and 2 stands for Si. 
Here V, is the diffusion potential, Co is the capaci- 
tance per unit area due to the heterojunction dipolar 
charge layer, ei and l 2 are the dielectric constants 
and Ni and N2 are the carrier concentrations. From 
the intercept on the V-axis of the Cn2 vs V plot, V, 
was found to be 1.2 eV and 1.6 eV for the 26°C and 
286°C films respectively. From the slopes of these 
curves, the carrier concentrations (N, > of ZnTe films were determined to be 7.7 X 10” cm-j and 8.3 X 
1013 cme3 for the films deposited at 26°C and 286°C 
respectively. The low free carrier concentration in 
the first film indicates the presence of deep traps in 
the amorphous film. 
Using the expression 
AE,=E,,-(q&,+6,+6,), 
where Eg, is the band gap of ZnTe, 6, is the Fermi 
level position of ZnTe from the top of the valence 
band and 6, is the Fermi level position from the 
bottom of the conduction band of Si, the conduction 
band discontinuity was found to be A E, = 0.56 eV 
for the films of 26°C. From this, the valence band 
discontinuity A E, was obtained using the relation 
A E, = A Eg - A E, and was found to be 0.58 eV. 
For the films deposited at 286°C AE, and AE, 
were found to be 0.16 eV and 0.98 eV respectively. 
The value of A E, has been reported to be 0.85 eV 
from photoemission measurements [ 151 which is rea- 
sonably close to our experimental value. 
3. Discussion 
For thermally deposited ZnTe films, it was found 
by Maity et al. [16] that the conductivity decreased 
with increase in substrate temperature, but in our 
laser deposited films it was higher for higher sub- 
strate temperature. The effect of substrate tempera- 
ture was explained on the basis of the temperature 
dependence of sticking coefficient of Zn which is 
positive. Hence, the concentration of zinc vacancies 
is reduced at higher substrate temperatures resulting 
in films with lower conductivity. The crystalline 
quality of the films deposited at higher substrate 
temperature was however not considered. In the 
present case for laser deposited films, the energy of 
the deposited ions is higher leading to greater surface 
mobility and better stoichiometry. Thus, the Zn va- 
cancy concentration remained the same for both 
substrate temperatures. The conductivity in this case 
was mainly determined by the crystalline quality of 
the films. Films deposited at 286°C substrate temper- 
ature were crystalline while those deposited at 26°C 
were amorphous. Thus the former films had larger 
free carrier (hole) concentration and mobility result- 
ing in higher conductivity.

4. Conclusion 
ZnTe films with band gap of 2.2 eV and good 
electrical properties have been obtained by pulsed 
laser ablation at a substrate temperature of 286°C. 
The advantages of laser deposition viz. better stoi- 
chiometry and crystallinity at optimum substrate 
temperature have been demonstrated in this study. 
ZnTe/Si heterojunctions have been studied using 
I-V and C-V characteristics and used to determine 
ideality factor and valence band offset A E,, which 
was in reasonable agreement with earlier values.
