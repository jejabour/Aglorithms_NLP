Abstract 
Reaction of R(2-pyr)NH (where R = Me, Ph or 2-pyr) with ‘Bu,Mg’ in an ether-free environment yields the corresponding 
alkyl(amido)magnesium derivative [{R(2_pyr)NMgBu},,]. When polar solvent is added to these species only bis(amido)magnesium 
compounds separate from solution and not the expected solvated alkyl(amido) derivatives. Isolation of one such alkyl(amido) compound 
prior to reaction with donor solvent proves that the mixed anion species do indeed exist. However, when polar molecules are introduced a 
disproportionation reaction ensues, yielding the homoleptic compounds [{R,Mg (S),},] and [((R,N),Mg @),},,I, where S is THF, 
TMEDA or PMDETA. Theoretical calculations likewise show that the disproportionation reaction of model compounds closely related to 
our systems is strongly exothermic. A ‘H/ 13C NMR spectroscopic study was used to assign the nature of the bis(amido) species in 
solution. From these analyses it was possible to propose that the solvated bis(amido) derivatives assume a common structural motif, that 
of a monomer (n = 1) with a pseudo-octahedral magnesium center.

1. Introduction 
Remarkably few studies, either synthetic or struc- 
tural, have focused on bis(amido)magnesium com- 
pounds [((R,N),Mg},] in their own right [l]. This 
contrasts with the ever increasing number of publica- 
tions concerning Grignard reagents [2] and to a lesser 
extent bis(organo)magnesium species [3]. The dearth of 
information on biscamides) is even more surprising 
considering the vast utility of amides of lithium, magne- 
sium’s diagonal neighbor, [4] as reagents in organic 
synthesis [5]. Bases such as lithium diisopropylamide 
(LDA) [6] and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS) 
[7] are commonly used as selective proton abstracters in 
organic transformations [5,8]. Also of note is the intrigu- 
ing structural variety that is found for the lithium amides, 
which has led to intensive research over the past decade

PII SOO22-328X(96)06202-X [9]. The little work that has been carried out on the 
corresponding amidomagnesium compounds has shown 
that they may have differing selectivities to their lithium 
counterparts, which is thought to be a consequence of 
their lower reactivity [lo]. Also associated with the 
lower reactivity of these species is a higher thermal 
stability which allows reactions to be conducted at 
elevated temperatures without decomposition of the base 
[lo]. Considering the obvious advantages that some 
magnesium amides may have over lithium amides, it is 
perhaps surprising that greater scrutiny has not been 
focused on the synthetic utility of these species. The 
limited investigations into the use of magnesium amides 
may in part be due to the reported difficulty in their 
preparation [ 1 I]. In particular alkyl(amido)magnesiums, 
[{R(R 2 N)Mg],,l d o not always react with a secondary 
amine to give the corresponding bis(amido) derivative. 
We recently reported [ 121 that the reaction between the 
Grignard reagent “BuMgCl (in tetrahydrofuran solution) 
and the alkali metal amide Ph(2-pyr)NM (M = Li or 
Na) in 1 : 1 ratio yields exclusively the biscamido) com-

pound [(Ph(2-pyr)N), Mg . (THF), ] 1 (and the bis(alkyl) 
compound [“Bu,Mg . (THF),]) and not the expected 
alkyl(amido) derivative [Ph(2-pyr)NMg”Bu] 2 (Eq. (1)). 
A comparative study was carried out on the alkali metal 
amide PhCH,NMCH,CH,NMe, (derived from the 
polyamine I\j’-benzyl-N,N-dimethylethylenediamine) 
which was found to yield the expected alkyl(amido) 
compound [{PhCH,(Me,NCH,CH,)NMg”Bu},] 3 on 
reaction with “BuMgCl (Eq. (2)). The crystal structures 
of 1 and 3 were elucidated.

Utilizing ‘H NMR spectroscopic and X-ray crystallo- 
graphic evidence we proposed that 2 forms as an ‘inter- 
mediate’ in the reaction. Furthermore, we proposed that 
2 is dimeric in solution, containing two four-coordinate 
magnesium centers with internal ligation from the nitro- 
gen of the 2-pyridyl unit as is found in the known 
structure of [{Ph(2_pyr)NMgNPh,j,] [ 131. Solvation of 
the metal center by THF molecules is possible in such a 
structure due to the ‘flat’, sterically undemanding nature

ity of the sp2 N-Mg dative bond. This solvation in- 
duces a disproportionation reaction into the bis(amido) 
and bis(organo) derivatives, the driving force of which 
is the increase in coordination number of the metal, 
from four in the dimer 2 to six in the monomer 1 
(Scheme 1). In comparison, the tetrahedral metal center 
in 3 is well protected towards attack from solvent 
molecules by the ligation of the NMe, unit which forms 
a rigid five-membered MgNCH,CH,NMe, ring (Fig. 
1). In this case reaction ceases at the alkyl(amido) stage 
with no evidence of disproportionation. From these 
observations it seems that the nature of the 2-pyridyl 
amine ligand is paramount in the determination of the 
product from this apparently simple reaction. 
We now outline further evidence for our proposed 
mechanism and also investigate the generality of this 
solvent induced disproportionation reaction. A ‘H/ 13C 
NMR study was instigated for the compounds produced 
to assign the character of these species in solution and 
to correlate this with the known solid state structures. 
An ab initio theoretical investigation of model systems 
for the disproportionation reaction was undertaken to 
assess the relative stability of the compounds involved. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Synthetic studies 
Preparation of the alkyltamido) ‘intermediate’ was 
carried out in an ether-free environment by reaction of 
‘Bu, Mg’ (in heptane) (purchased from Aldrich as a one 
molar solution in heptane, containing a 1 : 1 ratio of 
n-butyl to s-butyl units) with a secondary amine. These 
species were then subjected to attack by the donor 
solvents tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyl- 
ethylenediamine (TMEDA), and 1,1,4,7,7pentamethyl- 
diethylenetriamine (PMDETA) to investigate if any sol- 
vation would take place and indeed if disproportionation 
would occur. In addition to the amine Ph(2-pyr)NH, two 
other 2-pyridyl containing amines, namely 2,2-dipyri- 
dylamine [(2-pyr), NH] and methyl-2-pyridylamine 
K.W. Henderson et oL/Journul r?fOrpmomrrullic Chrmisrry S/8 (1996) 139-146 141 
[Me(2-pyr)NH], were studied for similar reaction. The 
aforementioned secondary amine PhCH,NHCH2CH,- 
NMe, was also the subject of similar reactions as a 
comparison to the 2-pyridyl containing amines. A series 
of compounds was isolated and these are listed in Table 
1. On addition of donor solvent to the ether-free com- 
pounds only the bis(amido) derivatives were isolated. 
Plainly, addition of donor solvent to the alkyl(amido) 
species drives a disproportionation reaction similar to 
that described between “BuMgCl and Ph(2-pyr)NM in 
THF. As well as the bis(amides) 1 and 4-S outlined in 
Table 1, we were able to obtain and characterize one 
ether-free alkyl(amido) ‘intermediate’. Reaction of 
‘Bu,Mg’ and (2-pyr),NH in toluene yields a microcrys- 
talline solid which was identified as a mixture of [(2- 
pyr& NMg”Bu] and [@pyr), NMg”Bu]. From this find- 
ing it is clear that the compound at the alkyl(amido) 
stage is stable, i.e. there is no inherent instability associ- 
ated with the mixed anion compounds that forces dis- 
proportionation. These results are fully in line with the 
proposed mechanism (Scheme 1). It is pertinent to note 
that reaction of PhCH 2 NHCH ,CH 2 NMe, with 
‘Bu, Mg’ yields the expected alkyl(amido) derivatives 
[PhCH,(Me,NCH,CH,)NMg”Bu] and [PhCH,(Me,- 
NCH,CH,)NM$Bu], which were then inert to attack 
by the polar solvents chosen. The mixture of isomers is 
a consequence of the reagent ‘Bu,Mg’ consisting of a 
1 : 1 blend of n-butyl to s-butyl units. Apparently a 
balance exists between thermodynamic and kinetic con- 
trol of the reaction. Being the stronger base the s-butyl 
group would be expected to cleave from the metal 
before the n-butyl chain, but in reality a mixture of 
components is yielded. The average ratio (over five 
experiments) of n-butyl to s-butyl units was found to be 
approximately 1 : 3 for mixtures 9 and 10. In these 
instances the reactions proceed under mainly kinetic 
control. A previous study by Raston, White and 
coworkers [ 141 revealed a similar result in which the 
reaction of ‘Bu,Mg’ with (Me,Si),NH affords a crys- 
talline form of [{(Me,Si),NMg”Bu],] in preference over 
the thermodynamically more favorable n-butyl deriva- 
tive. Further investigation of the reactivity of ‘Bu,Mg’ 
is currently in progress. In any event the metal centers in mixture 10 are protected from solvation by steric 
crowding. This is further evidence that it is the unique 
bonding mode of the 2-pyridyl ligand that is associated 
with the unexpected solvation reaction. The 2-pyridyl 
unit’s relatively flat, sterically undemanding character, 
coupled with the sp* hybridized nature of the pyridyl N 
atom attached to Mg, may result in part of the metal 
surface being exposed to attack by solvent molecules. 
Another aspect of the flexibility of the ligand is that the 
pyridyl group and the second unit bound to the amido 
nitrogen (phenyl, pyridyl or methyl) can tilt out of each 
others way, which may allow space for donor solvent 
attack at the metal. The assumption that the alkyl(amido) 
‘intermediate’ is dimeric appears reasonable from previ- 
ous research results. Dimeric structures have been found 
in the solid state for alkyl(amido) compounds contain- 
ing a chelating ligand, the classic example being 
[{Me(Me, NCH,CH,)NMgMe},] [ 151 which adopts a 
structure akin to that of 3. Similar dimers are found for 
the non-chelating dinitrogen species [{(Me,P),CoN= 
NMg’Bu . (Et@)],] 1161, which utilizes two ether 
molecules for donation, and the aforementioned com- 
pound [{(Me,Si),NMg”Bu],] [14] which has the un- 
usual coordination number of three at the metal. 
Monomeric structures may be produced only when the 
ligands present are large and bulky, as with the car- 
bazole derivative [(C,,H ,,N)MgEt . OFF),] [ 171, 
which to our knowledge is the only simple 
alkyl(amido)magnesium monomer to be crystallographi- 
tally characterized. Dimeric alkyl(amido) compounds 
have also been observed as the predominant species in 
solution using both ebullioscopic [ 181 and proton NMR 
1191 experiments. In the light of these previous studies 
the most likely structure for the chelating alkyl(amido) 
‘intermediates’ are dimers of the form [{R(2- 
pyr)NMgBu],] with each of the metal centers being 
coordinated by a pyridyl nitrogen leading to tetracoordi- 
nation at the magnesiums. 
The type of donor required to induce the dispropor- 
tionation reaction may be varied from a relatively small 
molecule such as THF to a much bulkier, chelating 
group such as PMDETA. Consequently, it is reasonable 
to assume that complexation of the metal occurs with

ease in the alkyl(amido) compound. This is also sup- 
ported by the fact that these reactions proceed under 
very mild conditions (ambient temperature) and that the 
products are obtained simply on cooling the resulting 
solutions. The generality of this reaction has been in- 
creased to cover two more 2-pyridyl containing amines, 
(2-pyr), NH and Me(2-pyr)NH. Although attempts were 
made at isolating all the species produced at both the 
alkyl(amido) stage and also after solvation with either 
THF, TMEDA or PMDETA, only those listed in Table 
1 were fully isolated and identified. This was mainly 
due to the high hydrocarbon solubility of some of the 
species produced, which led to difficulty in their separa- 
tion. Such high solubility is not surprising given their 
expected low oligomerisation or monomeric state. It is 
pertinent to note that reaction of PhCH,NHCH,CH,- 
NMe, with ‘Bu,Mg’ yields the expected alkyl(amido) 
compound 10 regardless of which donor solvent is 
present. No further reaction can take place in this 
instance since the magnesium is protected from attack 
[la. therefore exist for the formation of the six-coordinate 
magnesium center even though this implies that other 
metal centers must remain tetracoordinated in the 
alkyl(amido) dimer. The PMDETA ligand has the possi- 
bility of tricoordination. Also, in the case of the (2- 
pyr),N- containing compounds it is possible that fur- 
ther coordination may be achieved from the nitrogen of 
the second 2-pyridyl unit. In order to further investigate 
these questions a ‘H/ 13C NMR study was undertaken. 
From these results it may be possible to provide infor- 
mation on the solution nature of these species and to 
consider if any comparisons and conclusions may be 
drawn with the known solid state structures. 
2.2. NMR studies 
A more detailed examination of the biscamides) pre- 
pared reveals that a common structure may prevail. 
Each either contains one TMEDA or PMDETA unit or 
alternatively two THF molecules. Since internal ligation 
from the nitrogen of the 2-pyridyl ring is almost certain, 
as evidenced from the crystal structure of 1 [12], each 
metal center should contain (at least) tetracoordination 
from the two amide ligands. Donation of two nitrogens 
from the TMEDA or PMDETA will yield a structure 
similar to that of 1, i.e. a monomer with a six-coordi- 
nate magnesium. Formation of the bis(THF) solvated 
pseudo-octahedral compound 1 takes place even if only 
one equivalent of donor is added, i.e. no solid monosol- 
vated product is yielded. A strong preference must Tables 2 and 3 lists the ‘H and 13C NMR chemical 
shift values for the 2-pyridyl group of the bis(amides). 
As mentioned previously, an interesting feature of the 
compounds listed is the denticity of the donors used. 
THF is monodentate (binding through oxygen), TMEDA 
has the possibility to be didentate [20] (binding through 
nitrogen), while PMDETA has the possibility to be 
tridentate [21] (also binding through nitrogen). Remark- 
ably similar chemical shift values for the anion are 
found for the TMEDA and PMDETA complexes of 
Ph(2-pyr)N-, 4 and 5, and also for those of (2-pyr), N-, 
6 and 7. The averaged chemical shift difference for the 
‘H and ‘jC NMR spectra between 4 and 5 is only 0.03 
ppm in both instances. A similar situation is found for 6 
and 7 where the averaged ‘H chemical shift difference 
is 0.04 ppm and only 0.02 ppm for the ‘“C spectra. 
Such similar chemical shift values in both the ‘H and 
13C NMR spectra is strong evidence for similar struc- 
tures in solution [22]. This is reasonable to assume since

the electronic environments of both sets of compounds 
appear to be almost identical. It is likely that the 
TMEDA ligand in 4, 6 and 8 binds to the metal center 
in a didentate fashion resulting in a monomer similar to 
that of 1 with a magnesium coordination number of six. 
The probable structure for 5 and 7 is therefore a 
monomer with two nitrogen atoms bound to the metal 
leaving one nitrogen of the PMDETA hanging free. 
Such asymmetrical structures are known in the solid 
state for the PMDETA ligand [23], though it usually 
adopts a tridentate conformation [21]. It seems unlikely 
that coordination of all four pyridyl nitrogens in com- 
pounds 6 and 7 can take place in addition to the 
presence of the donor ligands TMEDA and PMDETA. 
Such a situation would create a coordination number of 
greater than six at the metal. Organomagnesium com- 
pounds are usually tetracoordinated in both the solid 
and solution states [24], though magnesium has a strong 
predilection for a coordination number of six in other types of compound, as recently noted in a structural 
review [25]. The bis(amido) compounds 1 and 4-8 
reported here are probably six-coordinate and this makes 
them relatively rare examples of pseudo-octahedral 
organomagnesiums. With this in mind it would be 
extremely doubtful if enough space is available for 
more than six bonds to the metal in these species. 
2.3. Theoretical studies 
Calculations on a model system using (NHCH= 
NH)- as amide anion, methyl as the organic unit and 
water as donor solvent were conducted at the HF/6- 
3 IG * level using the Gaussian 94 program for the 
geometry optimizations [26]. The aza-ally1 amide was 
chosen as a model since it has an sp’ p nitrogen 
available for chelation, similar to the 2-pyridyl contain- 
ing amines. Water was chosen as the simplest form of 
solvent, although in reality this would of course react to

form Mg(OH), . Formation of monomeric dialkylmag- 
nesium appears to be reasonable from previous NMR 
evidence [27]. The geometry optimized structures of the 
components involved are shown in Fig. 2 [28]. The 
energy of the disproportionation reaction was calculated 
according to Eq. (3) and found to be exothermic by 
-21.8 kcal mol-‘.

All the structures outlined in Fig. 2 have features 
comparable with known structures. The step-like 
alkyl(amido) dimer I is similar to the silylamido dianion 
[(SiMe,('BuN),Mg . (THF)],] [29]. A common strut- 
tural theme for dialkylmagnesium compounds is a tetra- 
coordinate monomer such as II [30]. Lastly, we know 
from our own crystal structure evidence that the octahe- 
dral bis(amido) derivatives such as III are stable [12]. 
The exothermicity of Eq. (3) supports the experimental 
observations for the disproportionation reaction. 
3. Conclusions 
In summary, we have given further evidence that the 
addition of donor solvent to an alkyl(amido)magnesium 
compound containing a 2-pyridyl amine unit causes a 
disproportionation reaction which yields the respective 
bis(amido) and bis(organo)magnesium compounds. It 
appears that it is the ‘flat’, flexible character of the 
ligands in the ‘intermediate’ alkyl(amido) compound 
which allows solvation and encourages subsequent 
cleavage of the compound. We reiterate that the driving 
force for alkyl(amido) cleavage lies in the effective 
increase in coordination number at the metal center. The 
reactions studied so far in this series show that the type 
of donor solvent used and the nature of the second 
organic group of the amine do not affect the outcome of 
the reaction, i.e. disproportionation proceeds regardless 
of which donor solvent is chosen or which R group is 
on the amine along with the 2-pyridyl unit. 
4. Experimental 
4.1. Syntheses 
All syntheses were conducted in Schlenk type glass- 
ware under a blanket of argon gas. The metallated 
compounds isolated were all found to be highly air and 
moisture sensitive and were handled in an argon filled 
glove box fitted with a recirculating column. 
Preparation of all of the bis(amides) was carried out 
in a similar manner. Dibutylmagnesium (purchased from Aldrich as a one molar solution in heptane, containing a 
1 : 1 ratio of n-butyl to s-butyl units) (10 mmol) was 
added dropwise to a stirred solution of amine (Ph@ 
pyr)NH, (2-pyr), NH or Me(2-pyr)NH) (10 mmol) in 10 
ml of toluene. After gas evolution ceased, a clear yellow 
solution remained. Donor solvent (THF, TMEDA or 
PMDETA) (10 mmol) was added to the stirred solutions 
showing no visible change. Conditions for the precipita- 
tion of solid material varied between reactions and are 
outlined individually. The solids were filtered from 
solution, washed with hexane (2 X 2 ml) and dried 
under vacuum. Yields reported represent the first batch 
of solid material produced.

very complex owing to the high degree of secondary 
splitting leading to overlapping signals, compounded by 
the fact that two components “Bu and “Bu were present 
(characteristic C H,-Mg triplet of “Bu at do.15 and C H

13C NMR spectra of 9 and 10 were of little diagnos- 
tic value due to numerous overlapping peaks arising 
from the mixture of compounds. 
Assignment of the spectra was aided by the use of 
Jmod, COSY 45 and C-H correlation experiments.
