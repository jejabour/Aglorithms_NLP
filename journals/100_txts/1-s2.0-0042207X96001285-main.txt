Amorphous Sic was prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition of SiH, and CH,. The 
properties of the Sic deposits were studied using a combination of infrared fIR1, RBS, ERD (electron recoiling 
detection) and AES measurement. lnfra red spectra showed the presence of Si-C, Si-H and C-H bonds. The 
compositions of the silicon, carbon and hydrogen in the films were found to be dependent on the preparation

Introduction 
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide (a-Si, -,C, : H) films 
have been under intense research since their successful prep- 
aration using the rf glow discharge technique.’ Silicon carbide is 
an important material for potential applications in photo- 
electronics, high temperature semiconducting devices, hard wear 
resistant coatings and protective barriers for corrosion or thermal 
oxidation. All these applications are due to its unique properties 
such as wide band gap, high electron mobility, high thermal 
conductivity and high melting point. Furthermore, SIC can also 
be used as a thin buffer layer for the growth of diamond films 
on silicon substrates.* For example a-S& _,C, : H was used as a 
wideband window material to enhance the conversion efficiency 
of amorphous solar cells.3 The significance of this material is that 
its electrical and optical properties can be controlled by varying 
the carbon, silicon and hydrogen composition of the film. 
In the present article, an investigation is focused on the struc- 
tural properties of a-Si, _ .C, : H films prepared by the plasma 
enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of silane SiH, and 
methane CH, using IR, RBS, ERD and AES measurement. 
Experimental 
Amorphous silicon carbide films were deposited on bare silicon 
substrates in a high frequency parallel-plate plasma reactor, with 
the frequency, rf power and substrate temperature maintained at 
13.56 MHz, 0.06 Wcm--* and 350°C respectively. The electrode 
diameters were 12 cm and they were 4 cm apart. The rf power 
*Paper based on that presented at the 9th International School on 
Vacuum Electron and Ion Technologies, 14-17 September 1995, Sozopol, 
Bulgaria was fed to the upper electrode, while the lower electrode which 
held the substrates, was grounded. The gas mixture of SM, and 
CH, was directly introduced into the reaction chamber, and the 
gas flow rates were 10 seem and 40 seem, respectively. Hydrogen 
concentration was determined by the ERD method. For this 
purpose the 4He+ ion beam from the Van de Graaff accelerator 
of JINR in Dubna has been applied. An ion energy of 2.4 MeV 
was chosen with the target tilted at an angle 15” with respect to 
the beam direction and the recoiled protons measured forward 
at an angle of 30’. 
Results and discussion 
The infrared spectra of amorphous silicon carbide films were 
obtained using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR- 
8101M Shimadzu). Figure 1 shows the spectra of samples pre- 
pared under different gas pressure in the working chamber. It 
can be seen that films contain the features found in a-Sic : H: the 
Si-C stretching modes at 7OK300 cm-‘, the Si-H stretching 
modes at about 2100 cm-‘, and the C-H stretching modes at 
about 2900 cm-‘. These results indicate small difference only at 
the C-H stretching modes. The amount of hydrogen increases 
with increasing pressure, and is bonded in C-H bonds. 
The hydrogen content was determined by the ERD method. 
In Figure 2 are plotted ERD spectra obtained from the deposited 
films which contain different amounts of incorporated hydrogen. 
ERD analyses show that the amount of incorporated H rose 
from 10 to 15 at%. These values were obtained by computer 
modeling of measured spectra, and compared with the results 
obtained from a Si reference sample implanted with H. Results 
from ERD measurements correspond with the result from IR 
measurement where the hydrogen content is computed from the 
concentration of the Si-H and C-H bonds.

Figure 3 shows the RBS spectra for three samples of different 
thickness of the deposited amorphous silicon carbide films. The 
spectra were smoothed out for better identification of differences. 
Differences are practically at the place that represents con- 
centration of carbon vs silicon and thickness of film. Typical 
concentrations were for silicon 40 at% and carbon 45 at%. 
Figure 4 shows an AES depth profile of sample SC5. The 
concentration of silicon and carbon are approximately the same, 
which differs from the concentrations obtained from RBS 
measurements and probably arises from accuracy of measure- 
ment. Small amounts of oxygen and nitrogen were present in the 
films at concentrations up to I or 2%, respectively. More carbon

Conclusion 
The structural properties of amorphous silicon carbide films pre- 
pared by PECVD have been investigated. The IR spectra show 
the presence of Si-C, Si-H, C-H bonds. The concentration of 
hydrogen determined by ERD is l&15 at%. The RBS and AES

results show that concentrations of Si and C are almost equal. The References 
concentrations of other elements such as oxygen and nitrogen are 
very small. The results indicate that the properties of amorphous 
carbon films depend upon the reaction conditions. The SijC ratio 
determines film properties, but the hydrogen content and the 
chemical bonding pattern play an important role, which cannot 
be ignored when considering film properties. ‘D A Anderson and W E Spear, Philos Mag, 35, 1 (1976).
