Abstract 
Polycrystalline diamond films have been deposited on pure titanium and Ti-6Al-4V in a microwave plasma reactor from 
CH,-H, and CO-H, gas mixtures, at a temperature in the range 600-900°C. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron 
microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that l-10 pm diamond layers could be produced at 600°C with a fairly good 
crystallinity and residual1 stresses limited to about 5 GPa. The intrinsic properties of the heat-treated titanium alloys are 
maintained at this tempering temperature and no spalling occurred when an appropriate pretreatment was carried out. 
Therefore we expect that diamond-coated titanium alloys could be used for general engineering applications where a low 
friction coefficient, low wear rate and load-bearing capacity are all necessary.

1. Introduction 
Titanium alloys have attractive properties includ- 
ing high specific strengths and moduli, coupled to a 
relatively low density. These properties have led to 
the use of titanium alloys in aerospace applications 
or as bioimplants. However, their poor wear resis- 
tance has limited the engineering applications. Vari- 
ous processes have been applied to titanium alloy 
substrates including thermochemical treatments, 
physical (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) [ll. Diamond-like carbon, amorphic and 
polycrystalline diamond films have been recently 
deposited to improve the friction and erosion proper- 
ties of titanium alloy substrates [2-51. In these previ- 
ous studies, polycrynalline diamond films presented 
yet high residual compressive stresses of about 7 
GPa when the deposition was carried out at 800- 
850°C [3,6]; they are due mainly to the large thermal 
expansion mismatch between diamond and titanium. 
Spalling generally occurs and only thin layers (< 1 pm) did not peel off during cooling the samples 
from the deposition to room temperature. Moreover, 
the intrinsic properties of the heat-treated titanium 
alloy substrates are not retained at temperatures 
higher than about 600°C. 
A lower deposition temperature was employed 
here to minimize the thermal stresses. We searched 
for a high nucleation density to increase the intrinsic 
stresses which are generally tensile for diamond 
layers [7], in order to reduce the total residual stresses. 
Information about the fiIm microstructure, its purity 
and the residual stresses was provided by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy 
@EM) and Raman spectroscopy. 
2. Experimental 
Diamond deposition was carried out in a plasma 
tubular reactor that crossed a wave-guide connected

to a 1.2 kW microwave generator (2.45 GHz). Vari- 
ous CH,-H, and CO-H, gas mixtures were used. 
However, diamond growth was generally carried out 
with 1% CH, or 8% CO in H,. The total gas flow 
rate was fixed at 200 seem and the total pressure was 
maintained in the range 5- 10 Torr. The deposition 
temperature was measured by an axial thermocouple, 
set at 0.5 mm below the deposition surface; it was 
varied in the range 600-900°C. The cylindrical sam- 
ples of 18 mm in diameter and 7 mm in thickness 
were machined from commercial titanium and an- 
nealed Ti-6Al-4V alloy. They were polished with 
different diamond pastes and then cleaned in acetone 
and ethanol. The nucleation density was enhanced by 
seeding the surface with a 1 pm diamond paste. 
Moreover, an in-situ pretreatment was applied to 
ensure the adherence of the films deposited at mod- 
erate temperatures [8]. 
Raman measurements were performed in back- 
scattering configuration, using a 514.5 nm Ar inci- 
dent laser beam with a 100 mW power. 
3. Results and discussion 
XRD revealed the presence of diamond, non- 
stoichiometric titanium carbide or oxycarbide and 
titanium. The a-Ti phase (hexagonal structure) was 
only present for pure titanium, while the /3-Ti phase 
(cubic structure) appeared also for Ti-6Al-4V, ob- 
viously stabilized by the vanadium incorporation. 
The structure and the composition of the interfacial 
region are being studied more thoroughly, as a func- 
tion of the pretreatment and deposition conditions, 
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary ion 
mass spectrometry, and transmission electron mi- 
croscopy coupled with electron energy loss spec- 
troscopy. Fig. la presents an 8 km diamond film 
deposited from CO-H,, at 600°C on Ti-6Al-4V. 
The corresponding Raman spectrum is typical of 
CVD diamond (Fig. 2a). The broad bands reveal a 
small codeposition of non-diamond carbon. The sharp 
double peaks at 1345 cm- ’ and 1336 cm-’ are 
assigned to polycrystalline diamond. The large shift, 
when compared to 1332 cm- ’ for natural diamond, 
and the partial splitting of this peak are attributed to 
the compressive residual stress 161. Fig. lb seems to 
indicate a good adhesion of a diamond film de- Fig. 1. SEM image of diamond films deposited at 600°C on

Diamond peak shift (cm-l)

ported versus the expertmental shift of the principal Raman 
diamond peak (corresponding to the doublet phonon); the films 
were deposited either from C-H (A) or from C-H-O (0)

residual stress gage factor of - 0.384 GPa/cm- ’ , is represented

posited at 600°C on Ti-6Al-4V from the CH,-H, 
mixture; the corresponding Raman spectrum is pre- 
sented in Fig. 2b. The film quality appears poorer 
than with CO-H,. The broadening of the asymmet- 
ric diamond feature (two peaks centered at 1343.5 
and 1333 cm-’ > can be attributed to more defective 
diamond and (or) a higher dispersion of the crystal- 
lite (subgrains) size and orientation [9,10]. On the 
other hand, the broad bands at 1140, 1450 and 1580 
cm-’ reveal a greater codeposition of amorphous 
and disordered sp* carbon. 
The thermal stress component which developed 
during cooling to room temperature can be directly 
calculated from Hoake’s law using a biaxial Young’s 
modulus for polycrystalline diamond of 1230 GPa 
[I 11. For titanium or Ti-6Al-4V, the temperature 
dependence of the thermal expansion is already 
known [ 121 and the thermal expansion of CVD dia- 
mond has been recently determined [13]. The com- 
pressive thermal stress can then be calculated. Fig. 3 
presents the experimental variation of the Raman 
peak shift of diamond as a function of the calculated 
thermal stress in the 600-900°C range. On the other 
hand, Ager and Drory [61 have recently developed a 
model that relates the observed Raman spectra to the 
residual stresses in diamond films. They derived the biaxial stresses corresponding to singlet and doublet 
phonon frequencies by using the diamond phonon 
deformation potentials and the compliance constants. 
For the doublet, the following equation was obtained 
[61: 
T= -0.384Au (GPa), 
where A v is the peak shift in cm- ’ . The calculated 
variation of the residual stress (7) as a function of 
the diamond peak shift is also reported in Fig. 3. 
This figure shows a fairly good agreement between 
our results and the Ager and Drory model, which 
allows to attribute the residual stresses mainly to the 
thermal expansion mismatch. However, a difference 
can be noted between the deposits obtained from the 
C-H and C-H-O containing gas mixtures that could 
be due to different intrinsic stresses. The Raman 
study shows a higher non-diamond carbon incorpora- 
tion, which is generally thought to be located at grain 
boundaries, when no oxygen is introduced in the 
plasma. In that case, the tensile intrinsic stress com- 
ponent is generally higher [7], and the residual 
stresses are accordingly lower. However, direct stress 
measurements by the curvature method or from XRD 
using the sin29 method [14], will be necessary to 
confirm this hypothesis. 
4. Conclusion 
A strong interface bonding seems to be obtained 
at high temperature (850-900°C) where no spalling 
of thin films (< 1 pm) occurs in spite of high 
residual stresses of about 8 GPa. We have shown 
here that diamond coating of titanium alloys is possi- 
ble at tempering temperature. At 600°C the residual 
stresses are only about 5 GPa; they could be slightly 
reduced by decreasing temperature in the 500-600°C 
range and by increasing the intrinsic stresses contri- 
bution. The first tribological tests have confirmed the 
good adhesion of the diamond films deposited at 
600°C. Complete results on the mechanical tests 
coupled to a thorough study of the structure and the 
composition of the interfacial region will be pub- 
lished in a near future. Finally, the use of diamond- 
coated titanium alloys in general engineering appli- 
cations can reasonably be expected.
