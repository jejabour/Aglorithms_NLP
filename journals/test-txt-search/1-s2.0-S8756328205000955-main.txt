Abstract
Orthopedic and dental implant fixation depends upon bone regeneration. Growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- h)
have been shown to enhance bone repair and strengthen the mechanical connection between implant and host skeleton in canine models. To
provide a platform for studying molecular mechanisms of growth factor stimulated bone regeneration and implant fixation, the present studyexamined peri-implant bone volume as a response to TGF- htreatment in a rodent model. The rat femoral ablation model in which an implant
is placed in the medullary cavity of the femur was used to examine the dose response to TGF- h2 applied to the implant (0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10 Ag).
The study included a total of 40 rats (10 per dose) examined at 28 days. Peri-implant bone volume and bone-implant contact were assessed
through microcomputed tomography and implant fixation strength was determined by a mechanical pullout test. Treatment of the implantwith 10 Ag TGF- h2 led to a 2-fold increase in bone volume ( P< 0.001) and a 1.5-fold increase in bone-implant contact ( P< 0.01) with a
trend of increasing fixation strength (non-significant increase of 1.4-fold). TGF- h2 treatment with 10 Ag led to uniform peri-implant bone
volume and bone-implant contact along the length of the implant, whereas the other groups had less bone at the mid-point compared to theproximal and distal aspects of the implant. About 50% of the variance in implant fixation strength was explained by a regression model
involving both bone-implant contact and peri-implant bone volume.

Introduction
Orthopedic and dental implants rely on bone regeneration
to achieve mechanical fixation to the host skeleton, arequisite for clinical success. A variety of anabolic agentsare now known to enhance bone regeneration. Recently,
considerable efforts have been made to enhance and
accelerate intramembranous bone regeneration, the partic-ular form of bone repair important for implant fixation.Several growth factors, including members of the TGF- h
superfamily, have demonstrated this ability in canine models[1–4] . These studies have shown that local application of
growth factor to the implant is an effective strategy toenhance peri-implant bone volume, bone-implant contact, orbone ingrowth as well as the mechanical force required to
dislodge the implant from the host skeleton.
There is a need for a small animal model to study
enhanced bone regeneration and implant fixation so thatmolecular biology endpoints can eventually be more easilyexamined. In the present study we have adapted a rat modelused originally to study hematopoiesis [5,6] and more
recently used to study intramembranous bone formation [7–
10]. A number of groups are now using an adaptation of this

model to examine issues related to implant fixation, with the
main focus to date being on implant surface treatments [11–
15]. This is an appropriate model for studies of implant
fixation because intramembranous bone formation is a basicrequirement for ‘‘cementless’’ implant fixation. Althoughgrowth factors have not received much attention in the ratmarrow ablation implant model, there is one recent study inwhich TGF- hdoses up to 1 Ag were reported to have no
effect [16].
The purpose of the present study was to determine if
local application of TGF- hin the rat model led to increased
peri-implant bone volume, bone-implant contact, and/orimplant fixation strength. Accordingly, we performed anexperiment to determine if doses of TGF- h2 ranging from
0.1 to 10 Ag/implant were effective in enhancing bone
volume, bone-implant contact, or implant fixation strength
at 28 days in the rat model.
Materials and methods
Forty 6-month-old male Sprague–Dawley rats were
implanted unilaterally with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phos-phate (HA/TCP)-coated titanium rods treated with buffer
only as a control, 0.1 Ag, 1Ag, or 10 Ag recombinant human
TGF-h2 in an IACUC-approved study. Animals were killed
4 weeks post-surgery. For each group, seven implantedfemurs were first analyzed by microcomputed tomography(ACT) to measure bone volume near the implant and bone-
implant contact, followed by a mechanical pullout test tomeasure the strength of fixation of the implant. Theremaining three specimens were embedded in plastic,
sectioned with a diamond band saw (Exakt Model 300CP)
into 1 mm thick slabs, ground to a nominal thickness of 100Am (Buehler model Phoenix 4000, Lake Bluff, IL), and
stained with toluidine blue and basic fuchsin, followingmethods previously described in detail [17].
Implants, TGF- bloading, and in vitro release
Titanium implants, 22 mm long and 1.5 mm diameter
(Grandis Metals, Lake Forest, CA), were coated with anHA/TCP surface by the plasma flame spray technique(Zimmer, Warsaw, IN). The HA/TCP layer was approx-imately 50 Am thick and has been determined to contain
80% hydroxyapatite, 15% tricalcium phosphate, and 5%uncharacterized calcium phosphates [1]. The target doses of
recombinant human TGF- h2 (a gift of Genzyme Corpo-
ration, Framingham, MA) were applied by pipetting 5.88 Al
volumes of diluted stock solutions uniformly onto the HA/TCP surface of each implant. The stock solutions wereformulated in a 30-mM Na citrate/3% mannitol, pH 2.5buffer. Control implants were treated with 5.88 Al of buffer.
The volume used for the TGF- h2 stock solution and the
control buffer was small enough to allow even coating of theimplant without saturation or dripping. The solutions weresterile and endotoxin free. The implants were air dried and
aseptically packaged. All handling of the sterile implantstook place in a class 100 laminar flow hood. An in vitrorelease kinetic experiment was performed to determine theamount of TGF- h2 released from the implant over time. The
study used one implant loaded with 1 Ag of growth factor
and one implant loaded with 10 Ag of growth factor, as
described above. The experimental procedures were similar
to those previously described in an in vitro study with a
canine implant [18]. Briefly, the release profile was created
by incubating the implants in phosphate-buffered saline with1% bovine serum albumin at 37 -C on a rocker. The sample
implants were placed into fresh aliquots of buffer at regularintervals (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 120, and 168 h). An ELISAusing the TGF- h-specific antibody, 1D11 (Genzyme Cor-
poration, Framingham, MA), was performed to assess the
temporal release.
Rat model
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (400–450 g, approximately
6 months old, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) received unilateralfemoral implants in the left femur in an IACUC approvalstudy. The implantations were performed under anesthesia
using ketamine (100 mg/kg ip) and xylazine (5 mg/kg ip),
supplemented as necessary. Each hind limb was first shavedand then scrubbed with Betadine and alcohol. Using aseptictechnique, a 1-cm incision medial to the patella was made toexpose the knee joint. A 2-mm hole was drilled into thepatellar groove with a Dremel drill bit to penetrate thesubchondral cortical bone and gain access to the femoralmedullary canal. The marrow cavity was disrupted by
inserting a threaded hand drill proximally through the entire
length of the diaphysis to approximately the level of thelesser trochanter. A guide implant was placed into theablated cavity to ensure that the canal was an appropriatesize to accommodate the definitive implant. The cavity wasthen flushed with 10 ml of sterile saline for removal of loosemarrow contents. Following irrigation, an implant wasplaced into the canal. Bone wax was used to plug the distal
end of the femur, and vicryl sutures protected by staples
were used to seal the wound. At 28 days, the rats wereeuthanized in a carbon dioxide chamber. The femurs forACT and mechanical testing were harvested, denuded of soft
tissue, and frozen at /C020-C. The femurs for histology were
placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Microcomputed tomography ( lCT) and determination of
peri-implant bone volume and bone-implant contact
ACT (Scanco 40, Scanco USA, Wayne, PA) scans were
taken at seven evenly spaced slices along the length of theimplant ( Fig. 1 ). The scan resolution was 16 Am in plane
with a slice thickness of 16 Am. At the proximal four
sections, the slices were analyzed for bone volume per totalvolume (BV/TV) after masking out the implant and adjacentA. De Ranieri et al. / Bone 37 (2005) 55– 62 56
16 voxels and the cortical bone to define the total volume
(MatLab, MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The adjacent 16voxels were masked in addition to the implant because testimages found metal-induced artifacts in these voxels,consistent with a recent report [19]. BV/TV was calculated
by binarizing the region of interest at a threshold equivalent
to¨175 in the Scanco software. This area of the femur is
normally devoid of bone so the assumption was made thatbone found within the medullary cavity in sections 1through 4 had formed since surgery. Bone-implant contactwas measured at all seven levels by using a grid with testlines that radiated outward from the center of the implantand counting the number of test line-implant interface
intersections positive for bone and dividing this sum by the
total number of test line-grid intersections. The criteria forassigning an intersection positive for bone were conserva-tive, requiring that the intersection have morphology typicalof bone as well as the appropriate grey scale intensity. Forbone-implant contact, the voxels immediately adjacent tothe implant were not excluded as we assumed that bone-implant contact could be judged by eye. Assessment ofbone-implant contact was performed by one individual who
was blinded to the treatment status and we have found ahigh intraobserver degree of reproducibility ( r= 0.928, P<
0.001 between repeated measurements).
Mechanical pullout test
Following ACT scanning, a mechanical pullout test to
measure the strength of fixation of the implant to the host
bone was performed. To prepare the specimen, the proximalpart of the femur was embedded in dental acrylic (LangDental, Wheeling, IL) and 2–4 mm of the implant wasexposed. The exposed implant was gripped and S hookswere placed at either end of the specimen to permit coaxialalignment of the implant with the direction of force. Pullouttesting was conducted at a displacement rate of 0.25 mm/
min to failure with the force recorded in Newtons (Instron
model 8871, Canton, MA). Because the part of the implantexposed for gripping varied, we report shear strength ascalculated by dividing the force (N) at the point of failure bythe surface area of the implant nominally in contact withtissue (implant circumference /C2implant length not exposed
for gripping). One specimen in the 1.0 Ag was not included

because of a technical problem during testing. To determine
the baseline strength of fixation, implants were placed in 10rat femurs ex vivo following the surgical protocol exceptthat the site was not irrigated. These specimens were thensubjected to the pullout test.Statistical analyses
The morphometric and mechanical data appeared to be
normally distributed and were, therefore, analyzed byanalysis of variance with Bonferonni corrected post hoctests, repeated measures analyses of variance and stepwisemultiple regression (SPSS version 11.0 for Windows, SPSS,Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
In both the 1- Ag and 10- Ag loaded implants, 25–30% of
the adsorbed TGF- hwas released into the medium,
predominately within the first 48 h ( Fig. 2 ). There was
only very slow release after 48 h.
Inspection of the ACT images showed that implants
treated with the 10- Ag dose of TGF- h2 typically had a zone
of mineralized bone in the peri-implant region, but the lowerdose and control groups had no apparent increase in bone(Fig. 3 ). Histology showed that there typically was a very
thin layer of bone that had formed on the HA/TCP surfacewhether or not the implant had been treated with TGF- h2
(Figs. 4 A and B). This layer was about 5–10 Am thick.
Along most aspects of the implant there were few apparent
connections between this thin layer and the surroundingbone, except in the 10- Ag dose group. In addition, in the 10-
Ag dose group, there was often a rim of bone separated from
the implant by a space 50–200 Am wide that was often
filled with apparent unmineralized osteoid ( Figs. 4 C and D).

The quantitative study of BV/TV showed dose was a
significant factor ( P< 0.001 in the analysis of variance)
with the 10- Ag group having significantly elevated BV/TV
compared to each of the other groups ( P< 0.001) ( Fig. 5 A).
Similarly, bone-implant contact varied as a function of dose(P< 0.001 in the analysis of variance) with the 10- Ag group
having significantly elevated bone-implant contact com-pared to each of the other groups ( P< 0.01) ( Fig. 5 B).
The distribution of bone varied along the length of the
implant in two basic patterns. In the control group, BV/TV(which was only measured at sections 1 through 4) was
highest proximally followed by a drop off in sections 2through 4 ( Fig. 6 A, top panel). A similar pattern was
observed for BV/TV for all growth factor-treated groupsexcept the 10- Ag group which showed a more uniform
distribution of BV/TV in sections 1 through 4 ( Fig. 6 A,
bottom panel). This observation was confirmed by therepeated measures analyses of variance which showed
significant section location effects for BV/TV for the 0-
Ag, 0.1-Ag, and 1.0- Ag groups ( P< 0.001 in each group),
but not for the 10- Ag group ( P= 0.456). Bone-implant
contact (which was measured at all 7 sections examined byACT) was highest proximally (section 1) and distally
(section 7) in the control group with less contact towardthe middle of the implant ( Fig. 6 B, top panel). The
distribution of bone-implant contact was similar in the other
treatment groups except the 10- Ag treatment group which
had a more uniform distribution of bone-implant contact(Fig. 6 B, bottom panel). Statistically, there was a significant
within-subjects section effect for bone-implant contact forthe 0-Ag, 0.1-Ag, and 1.0- Ag groups ( P< 0.001), but not for
the 10- Ag group ( P= 0.097).
The mechanical pullout results showed a non-significant
dose-dependent trend of elevated strength ( Fig. 5 C;P=
0.480 in the analysis of variance). One of values for the
1.0-Ag group was very low compared to the other cases in
this group (0.15 MPa vs. a range of 1.17–2.32 for theother cases). If this case is eliminated as an outlier, thenthis group had the highest implant strength of fixation(1.87 T0.45 vs. 1.69 T0.61 MPa for the 10- Ag group and
1.22 T0.42 MPa for the control group), although statisti-
cally there still was not a significant dose effect ( P=
0.132 in the analysis of variance). The baseline strength of
fixation strength was 0 MPa in 9 of the 10 bonesimplanted ex vivo and was less than 0.02 MPa in theother bone.
Implant fixation strength was dependent upon BV/TV
and bone-implant contact. In the multiple regression modelin which BV/TV at each of the four sections measured andbone-implant contact at each of the 7 sections measured
were allowed to enter the equation, a model involving bone-
implant contact at sections 3 and 7 and BV/TV at section 1was found to account for 52% of the variance in implantfixation strength ( P< 0.001; Table 1 ). The strongest
bivariate correlation with strength was for bone-implantcontact at section 3 ( r= 0.547, P= 0.002), implying that
this variable alone accounted for nearly 30% of the variancein implant fixation strength.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that treatment of the
implant with 10 Ag TGF- h2 resulted in enhanced peri-
implant bone volume and bone-implant contact in the ratmodel. Lower doses (1 Ag and 0.1 Ag) were not effective.
Fig. 5. (A) Bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) for the region between
the implant and endocortical surface increased as a function of dose ( P<
0.001 in the one-way ANOV A); **group different than each other group(P< 0.001). (B) Bone-implant contact increased as a function of dose ( P<
0.001 in the one-way ANOV A); *group different than each other group ( P<

There was only a trend toward increased mechanical
fixation of the implant, with a slight dose dependency.
The morphologic findings are consistent with previous
work in canine models in which either TGF- h1 or TGF-
h2 applied to the implant led to increased bone formation[1–3,18,20,21] . Experiments on enhancement of peri-
implant bone formation (intramembranous repair) withTGF-hin other species are not common, with negative
findings reported for sheep [22]and rats [16]. Positive results
on fracture healing (endochondral repair) following release

of TGF- hfrom a medullary implant have been reported in
rats [23]. The dose range used in the sheep study [22]
overlapped the effective doses used in the canine studiesso it is not clear why no benefit was found in the sheepstudy. The maximum dose used in the rat study [16] was
1Ag and, in consideration of the findings from the
present study, may simply have been too low to elicit a
morphologic or mechanical effect.
A limitation of the rat model used in the present study is
that the magnitude of the anabolic effect appears to be lowerthan found in canines for the mechanical endpoint ofimplant fixation strength. The fixation strength of theimplant in the 10- Ag group was a non-significant 39%
higher than the control group in the present experiment. Incontrast, in the canine model, implant fixation strength can
be increased by as much as 3-fold following growth factor
treatment [3], consistent with 2- to 4-fold increases in BV/
TV within the gap in canine models [1,3,18] . Interestingly,
BV/TV in the 10- Ag group in the present study was more
than 2-fold greater than the control, a value consistent withfindings for the gap region in canine models.
We propose that differences in bone-implant geometry in
the rat and canine models may account for the different
mechanical responses in these two species. In the rat model,
it is likely that some degree of mechanical fixation occursproximally and distally regardless of treatment because ofthe proximity of the implant to the host bone in theselocations, although the baseline mechanical fixation was nil.Nevertheless, the close proximity of the implant to the hostbone may account for the finding of higher bone-implantcontact at these sections in the present study and previous
studies from our laboratory than at the midpoint of the
implant [14,15] . Furthermore, in these two previous studies,
only bone-implant contact from the most proximal anddistal sections was predictive of implant fixation strength[14,15] . In contrast, in the present study in which bone
regeneration was enhanced, bone-implant contact at section3 (the midpoint of the implant) was the first variable to enterthe regression model predicting implant fixation strength. In
the canine model the greater absolute size of the bone allows
for creation of a controlled defect, meaning that proximity tohost bone is always low and that treatment-inducedincreases in implant fixation strength are greater than in
the rat model. Thus, the anatomy of the rat model, involvingsome degree of inherent proximal and distal implantproximity to host bone, limits to some extent the magnitudeof increase achievable with mechanical endpoints. Anothercontributing factor limiting the sensitivity of the mechanicalmeasurements may have been the presence of the HA/TCPcoating on the implant (the carrier for the growth factor).
Calcium phosphate coatings are known to enhance implant
fixation [24,25] and the HA/TCP coating used in the present
study was found to enhance mechanical fixation by 50%compared to non-HA/TCP treated implants in the rat model(unpublished data).
The data from the present study may be useful in the
design of future studies. For instance, for the 39% differ-ence in implant fixation strength between the control group
and 10 Ag treatment group to be significant, given the
relatively high variance for this measurement, a sample sizeof 20 per group would be needed (assuming a= 0.05 and b=
0.80) [26]. Even if we make this calculation using the data
from the 1.0- Ag group with the one outlier removed (i.e.,
where the difference between this group and the controlgroup was 53%), a sample size of 9 per group would beneeded to demonstrate an effect. Thus, should the goal be to
show directly an increase in mechanical fixation strength,
future experiments need to be designed with greater samplesizes.
Clearly, the use of morphological data (in this case, BV/
TV, and bone-implant contact) as opposed to mechanicaldata permits discrimination between TGF- htreatment
groups in the rat model with smaller sample sizes thanrequired for the mechanical endpoint on implant fixation
strength. It is possible that creating more connections
between the regenerating bone and the host bone wouldlead to a more profound mechanical effect. However, giventhat approximately 50% of the variance in implant fixationstrength was associated with variance in bone-implantcontact and peri-implant BV/TV in the present study, it islikely that use of TGF- hdid have a mechanical effect, but
that it simply was not directly detectable.
The in vitro growth factor release profile found in the
present study was consistent with previous work in ourlaboratory in which canine implants were used [18] as the
release occurred rapidly with essentially no sustainedrelease beyond 48 h. In the rat model, there wasapproximately 30% cumulative release as opposed toapproximately 15% cumulative release in the canine model[18]. If one assumes the released TGF- his responsible for
the biological activity and that the in vitro release profile is
characteristic of the in vivo profile, then TGF- h’s effect may
be primarily during the early phase. The finding that thetranscription profiles for the inflammatory marker gene,cyclooxygenase-2, was altered at early time points follow-ing TGF- htreatment in this model is consistent with this
interpretation [27]. Alternatively, it is possible that it is the
growth factor retained on the implant that causes theTable 1

enhancement of bone formation, implying that the anabolic
stimulus was available over a more prolonged time frame.
The cascade of morphological events following marrow
ablation is well defined [5–9] . In the rat femoral implant
model, the basic regenerative cycle is similar to the marrowablation model in that the surgical injury induces medullarybone formation within 14 days, followed by a period ofbone remodeling during which much of the medullary bone
is removed, although some bone is left in contact with the
implant [11,14] . In the present study, a relatively large
volume of peri-implant bone was still present at 28 days inthe 10- Ag TGF- hgroup compared to the control group and
to previous rat implant studies [11,14] . The likely mecha-
nism of action can be inferred from a recent study in thesame model which found that application of TGF- h2 to the
implant led to up-regulation of gene expression for several
markers of bone formation between days 7 and 14 (collagen
type I, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin,osteopontin, and core binding factor 1) without latesuppression of markers often associated with bone remodel-ing (tumor necrosis factor alpha and cyclooxygenase-2)[27]. Thus, it is likely that the 10- Ag TGF- hdose stimulated
bone formation without altering bone resorption, resulting inprolonged persistence of peri-implant bone volume.
