Ultrastructural spacesWater may affect the mechanical behavior of bone by interacting with the mineral and organic phases through
two major pathways: i.e.hydrogen bonding and polar interactions. In this study, dehydrated bone was soaked
in several solvents ( i.e.water, heavy water (D 2O), ethylene glycol (EG), dimethylformamide (DMF), and carbon
tetrachloride(CCl 4)) that are chemically harmless to bone and different in polarity, hydrogen bonding capability
and molecular size. The objective was to examine how replacing the original matrix water with the solvents
would affect the mechanical behavior of bone. The mechanical properties of bone specimens soaked in these sol-vents were measured in tension in a progressive loading scheme. In addition, bone specimens without any treat-
ments were tested as the baseline control whereas the dehydrated bone specimens served as the negative
control. The experimental results indicated that 22.3 ± 5.17 vol% of original matrix water in bone could be re-placed by CCl
4, 71.8 ± 3.77 vol% by DMF, 85.5 ± 5.15 vol% by EG, and nearly 100% by D 2Oa n dH 2O, respectively.
CCl4soaked specimens showed similar mechanical properties with the dehydrated ones. Despite of great differ-
ences in replacing water, only slight differences were observed in the mechanical behavior of EG and DMF soakedspecimens compared with dehydrated bone samples. In contrast, D
2O preserved the mechanical properties of
bone comparable to water. The results of this study suggest that a limited portion of water ( b15 vol% of the orig-
inal matrix water) plays a pivotal role in the mechanical behavior of bone and it most likely resides in small ma-trix spaces, into which the solvent molecules larger than 4.0 Å cannot in ﬁltrate.

Introduction
Bone is a natural composite material with a highly hierarchical struc-
ture and consists of three major constituents: i.e.mineral, organic
matrix, and water, respectively. It has been known for decades that re-
moval of water (dehydration) may lead to a marked decrease in the
toughness and an increase in the stiffness of bone, suggesting that
water plays an important role in both pre- and post-yield behavior of
bone [1,2].
Previous NMR studies reveal that water in bone is present in three
different conformations: namely freely mobile water in pores, such as
Haversian canals, canaliculi, and lacunae spaces; bound water at surfaces
and/or within the mineral and collagen phases; and structural water as
part of collagen and mineral molecules [3–5].W a t e rm a yr e s i d ei nt h e
gap between the mineral –collagen interface in an order of several ang-
stroms [6]. On the other hand, such matrix water may be replaced by
minerals during continuous mineralization process [7]. Moreover, re-
moval of water was speculated to alter the behavior of the collagenphase, thus reducing its capacity to dissipate energy in bone [8]. Fur-
thermore, dynamic mechanical analyses indicate that bone viscoelasticbehavior is most likely related to water in bone rather than the collagen
phase itself [9,10] . However, the respective contribution of these three
types of matrix water to the mechanical properties of bone is still poorlyunderstood.
In this study, we hypothesized that the bulk mechanical properties
of bone are signi ﬁcantly related to the water molecules that reside in ex-
tremely small ( i.e.angstrom level) spaces of bone matrix, into which
only water or a solvent akin to water can in ﬁltrate. To test the hypoth-
esis, we proposed to replace water in bone matrix with several solventsthat are harmless to the structural integrity of bone constituents ( i.e.
mineral and collagen) and have different molecular size ( i.e.kinetic
diameter) and/or chemical characteristics ( i.e.polarity and hydrogen
bonding ability). Then, the correlation of molecular size, polarity, andhydrogen bonding ability with the soaking ability of the solvents into
bone matrix and its effect on the mechanical behavior of bone were
investigated.

eases. The donor ages were 51, 52, 54, 56, 58 and 76 years, respectively.
Seven (7) dog-bone-shaped tensile test specimens were prepared from
the mid diaphysis of each tibia using a CNC machine and randomly di-
vided into seven (7) groups, including four (4) test groups ( Table 1 )i n
addition to a control (dehydrated and rehydrated), a baseline control(wet bone without any treatment), and a negative control (dehydrated)group. The specimens had a gauge length of 10 mm and a gauge cross-
section of 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm. The prepared specimens were preserved
in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and stored in a freezer at
−20 °C prior to the treatments.
Selection of solvents
Since water molecules interact with the mineral and organic phases
in bone through two major pathways: i.e.hydrogen bonding and polar
interactions, the following solvents were selected from a pool of poten-tial solvents that have different polarity, hydrogen bonding capability
and molecular size ( Table 1 ).
Water (H
2O)—Water is a good polar solvent [11,12] and has an es-
timated intermolecular hydrogen bond energy of 20.5 kJ/mol [13].
Water has the smallest molecular size (2.4 –2.6 Å) compared with the
other solvents [14,15] .
Heavy water (D2O)—Heavy water molecules contain two deuterium
(hydrogen isotope) atoms in lieu of the hydrogen atoms in water mole-
cules. It has similar polarity, chemical structure and molecular size
(2.6 Å) [16] compared to water, with a slightly higher hydrogen bond
energy (~8%).
Ethylene glycol (EG)—Ethylene glycol molecules have two hydrogen
atoms attached to two separate oxygen atoms, thus allowing it to formstrong hydrogen bonds readily with other molecules and high polarity
akin to water. In addition, EG is the smallest organic molecule that can
form hydrogen bond network like H
2O[17]. However, it has a much
larger molecular size (4.0 Å) [18] compared with H 2O and is the
greatest among all other solvents in viscosity. Since it is harmless to bi-
ological systems, the polymerized ethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol)
have been used as cell culture scaffolds in tissue engineering studies[19,20] .
Dimethylformamide (DMF)—DMF has a polarity comparable to EG,
but lacks the ability to serve as a donor of hydrogen bonding like
EG. DMF has a similar viscosity, but a larger molecular size (5.50 Å)compared to EG [15]. DMF also has been safely used as a co-solvent in
cell culture [21,22] and does not cause denaturation of collagen mole-
cules [17].
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl
4)—CCl 4possesses neither the hydrogen
bonding ability nor the polarity due to its tetrahedral symmetry andhas a molecular size (4.65 –5.90 Å) comparable to that of MDF [14].I t s
viscosity (0.84 –0.95 cP at 20 °C) is slightly lower than that of H
2O
(1.00 cP at 20 °C) even though its density is much higher. CCl 4has
also been used as co-solvent in cell culture studies [23].
In this study, the kinetic diameter was used to estimate the molecu-
lar size of the solvents. In addition, the hydrogen bonding energy was
used as the measure of the ability of solvent molecules to form hydro-
gen bonds with others. Moreover, the dielectric constant and dipole
moment were used to de ﬁne the polarity of the solvents. Finally, the vis-
cosity of the solvents was also listed in the table in comparison betweenthe solvents for viscous ﬂow in bone.
Although it is hard, if not impossible, to adjust only one variable ( i.e.
polarity, hydrogen bonding ability, and molecular size) while keeping
all others exactly the same, it is still possible to markedly vary one pa-
rameter while keeping the others relatively similar between two sol-
vents. In this study, we managed to select the solvents that could be
compared in this manner. For instance, water (H
2O) is very similar to
heavy water (D 2O) except for a slight difference in hydrogen bonding
energy. In addition, the major difference between water (H 2O) and eth-
ylene glycols (EG) is the molecular size (2.6 Å vs. 4.0 Å) while the otherchemical characteristics are very similar. Comparing EG and DMF, their
major difference is re ﬂected in the hydrogen bonding ability. Compar-
ing DMF and CCl
4, their major difference is in polarity.
In theory, these solvents are considered to be chemically inert to the
mineral (mainly hydroxylapatite) phase of bone. Also unlikely is thenegative effect of the selected solvents on the structural integrity of col-
lagen as they are often used as co-solvents in biological studies
[19,20,23 –26]. To further verify this, a pilot study was performed by
treating demineralized bone samples ( N= 2) in each of the selected
solvents for three days at ambient temperature and then having them
tested in tension. During the entire soaking process, we did not observe
any visual damage and dissolved residues in the solvents. The mechan-
ical tests indicated that the failure strain of all samples was between
0.21 and 0.25 irrespective of the solvents, which is very consistent
with that (0.21 –0.22) of controls (soaked only in PBS). By ruling out
the negative effect of the selected solvents on the structural integrity

of bone constituents, the possible effect of the solvents on bone would
be inﬂicted mainly through intermolecular interactions, such as polarity
and hydrogen bonding ability.
Replacement of water with the selected solvents
Before soaking, the matrix water was ﬁrst removed from all bone
specimens using a simple dehydration protocol [2]. Brie ﬂy, the speci-
mens were dried in 1.0 mm Hg vacuum at 70 °C till the weight loss
leveled off to reach the equilibrium. This dehydration condition was
chosen because our previous study showed that drying bone samples
at this temperature for 4 h would remove all mobile and most bound
water without in ﬂicting structural damage to the mineral and collagen
phases in bone [2,27] . Afterwards, the weight change of the dehydrated
specimens was measured and converted to the volume of water re-
moved from the specimens. Then, the dehydrated specimens were
soaked in these solvents until no changes in the soaking weight were
observed. Then, the weight after soaking was measured for the speci-
mens. The volume percent of water replaced by each solvent was deter-
mined using the following formula:
vol% of water replaced ¼Soaked weigh− Dry weight
Water volume /C2Density of Solvent/C2100 ð1Þ
The soaking history was plotted as the volume of water replaced by
the solvent as a function of time.
Mechanical testing
Tensile tests of all bone specimens were performed on a Bose
ElectroForce 3330 mechanical test machine. To fully capture the evolu-
tion of the mechanical behavior of bone in the loading process with in-
creasing strain, a well-de ﬁned progressive loading protocol ( Fig. 1 )w i t h
multiple diagnostic loading cycles was employed following the proce-dure described elsewhere [28]. The loading scheme consists of a series
of diagnostic loading –unloading cycles to capture the mechanical prop-
erties of bone at each incremental loading level (strain). Each cycle in-
cluded four steps: (a) Loading at constant rate of 0.05 mm/s to an
incremental displacement level; (b) Dwelling for 150 s at a speci ﬁed
displacement level; (c) Unloading at a constant rate of 0.05 mm/s to apreset load level of 25 N; and (d) Dwelling again for 150 s at the preset
load of 25 N prior to the next loading cycle. The test specimens were
kept wet by constantly dripping the corresponding soaking media tothe specimens during the entire test. The following parameters were
measured to quantify the mechanical behavior of bone specimens
(Fig. 1 ):
•
Applied stress and strain in each cycle ( σiandεi): These stress and
strain values were measured at the end of the loading step in
each cycle to determine the stress –strain relationship over the loading
process.
•Plastic strain ( εp): The plastic strain was measured as the residual
strain at the end of each cycle.
•Yield strain ( εy)and plastic ﬂow coef ﬁcient ( k):εywas measured as
the onset strain of plastic deformation, which was determined byﬁtting the linear part of the plastic strain ( ε
p) vs. applied strain ( εi)
curve to the equation: εp=kεi−εy, where εyis the intercept with
the axis of applied strain and kis the slope of the curve, indicating
the intensity of plastic ﬂow with the bulk deformation.
•Ultimate stress ( σu):σuwas de ﬁned as the maximum stress measured
during the entire loading process.
•Initial elastic modulus ( E0):E0was calculated as the slope of the linear
part of the stress –strain curve in the loading step of the ﬁrst cycle.
•Progressive elastic modulus ( Ei):Eiwas calculated in each loading
cycle as the slope of the line joining the equilibrium points at theend of stress relaxation dwell and the end of creep dwell in the cycle
(Fig. 1 ). Since the modulus loss can be de ﬁned as an exponential
decay with the applied strain ( ε
i) as described in previous studies
[29]:Ei=E0e−mεi,w h e r e mwas de ﬁned as the modulus decay factor,
reﬂecting the sensitivity of bone to modulus loss.
•Hysteresis energy ( Uh):Uhwas determined as the area between the
load –unload regions of the stress –strain curve in each loading cycle,
which is a measure of the energy dissipation due to the viscous re-sponse of bone.
•
Plastic strain energy ( Up):Upwas determined as the area between the
load and reload regions in every two consecutive cycles, which is re-
lated to the energy dissipation in bone due to plastic deformation in
the loading cycle.
•Released elastic strain energy ( Uer):Uerwas determined as the area
between the unload curve and the line from the beginning point of
unloading with the slope of the initial elastic modulus ( E0), which is
related to the elastic strain energy released due to damage accumula-tion in bone.
Statistical analysis
Simple Student t-tests were performed to detect the differences in
all measured parameters between the test groups. The statistical signif-
icance was considered only if pb0.05.
Results
Water replacement by the selected solvents ( Table 2 )
The weight fraction of original water in the bone specimens was very
consistent across all test groups. The soaking results indicated that H
2O
(98.6 ± 2.96%) and D 2O (96.1 ± 1.38%) could almost completely re-
place the original volume of water removed by dehydration. EG and
DMF replaced 85.5 ± 5.15% and 71.8 ± 3.77% of the original volume
of water, respectively. In contrast, bone soaking in CCl 4reached satura-
tion at only 22.3 ± 5.17% of the original volume of water. In addition,the soaking rate of bone in EG, DMF and CCl
4was much slower than
that in H 2Oa n dD 2O.
Stress –strain relationship
Similar strain –stress curves were observed among the baseline con-
trol, H 2O and D 2O soaked specimens, demonstrating an initial linear
portion, yielding, and considerable post-yielding deformation ( Fig. 2 ).Strain1

In contrast, negative control (Dehydrated), CCl 4, DMF, and EG soaked
specimens all exhibited a linear stress –strain behavior without appre-
ciable post-yield deformation. Among them, however, DMF and EG
groups allowed for a higher maximum stress and slightly greater failure
strain compared to dehydrated and CCl 4groups. Below are more details
about the pre-yield, post-yield, and viscous responses of bone in differ-ent test groups.
Initial elastic modulus, modulus loss and associated energy dissipation
Soaking in different solvents had signi ﬁcant effects on the initial
elastic modulus ( E
0)o fb o n e( Table 3 ). The dehydrated and CCl 4groups
had the highest initial elastic modulus, followed by EG and DMF groups,
and H 2O, D 2O, with baseline control groups exhibiting the lowest initial
elastic modulus.
In addition, a signi ﬁcant modulus loss (exponential decay) was ob-
served in bone specimens of H 2O, D 2O, and baseline control groups.
However, no signi ﬁcant modulus loss (only a slight trend of decrease)
was exhibited in the specimens of EG, DMF, CCl 4,a n dD e h y d r a t e d
groups ( Fig. 3 ).
Correspondingly, H 2O, D 2O and baseline control specimens exhibit-
ed a much higher capacity in dissipating the released elastic strain ener-
gy (Uer). It was also noted that the baseline control showed a slightly
steeper slope in dissipation of released elastic strain energy with the ap-plied strain compared to H
2Oa n dD 2O groups ( Fig. 6 a). In contrast, no
released elastic strain energy dissipation was observed in the CCl 4
soaked and dehydrated specimens, whereas the DMF and EG soaked
specimens only exhibited an onset of released elastic strain energy dis-
sipation ( Fig. 6 a).
Yielding, post-yield deformation and associated energy dissipation
Signiﬁcant differences were observed in the yield strain ( εy)a n dt h e
post-yield deformation of bone among the control and test groups(Table 3 ). First, the DMF, EG, CCl
4and dehydrated groups hardly showed
any appreciable yielding and a trivial plastic deformation, whereas theH
2O, D 2O and baseline control groups exhibited the transition (yielding)from the elastic deformation to the post-yield plastic deformation with
a relatively consistent yield strain ( εy) and plastic ﬂow coef ﬁcient ( k).
Next, the failure strain ( εf) was signi ﬁcantly higher for the H 2O, D 2O
and baseline control groups compared with the DMF and EG, CCl 4and
dehydrated groups, which all failed at very limited strains ( b0.8%).
A similar trend of plastic strain energy dissipation ( Up) was observed
among the bone specimens from H 2O, D 2O and baseline control groups,
whereas trivial plastic strain energy dissipation existed for the DMF, EG,
CCl4and dehydrated groups ( Fig. 4 ). However, it is notable that the EG
and DMF groups exhibited an onset of plastic strain energy dissipation,whereas the CCl
4and dehydrated groups exhibited no plastic energy
dissipation at all ( Fig. 6 b).
Viscous response and hysteresis energy dissipation
H2O, D 2O and baseline control specimens exhibited similar increases
in the stress relaxation with increasing bone deformation up to a transi-
tion point close to 0.6% strain ( Fig. 5 ). Beyond the transition point, the
stress relaxation was leveled off irrespective of increasing strain, sug-gesting that bone reached to a steady state of viscous response. In con-
trast, the stress relaxation was more limited for DMF, EG, CCl
4and
dehydrated groups, counting less than 50% of stress relaxation shownin H
2O, D 2O and baseline control groups.
A comparison of the hysteresis energy dissipation in bone for all ex-
perimental groups revealed that the total viscous energy dissipation in
the DMF and EG specimens were considerably lower than that of the
baseline control, H 2Oa n dD 2O groups, with CCl 4and dehydrated groups
showing almost no hysteresis energy dissipation at all ( Fig. 6 c). Also
observed was that the baseline control specimens showed a slightly
steeper slope in dissipating viscous energy compared to the D 2O, H 2O
specimens.
Discussions
This study was performed to determine how the mechanical behav-
ior of bone would be affected by replacing matrix water in bone with
several selected solvents that have different polarity, hydrogen bonding

ability, and molecular size. The results demonstrate that the soaking
ability of the solvents into bone is remarkably different ( Table 2 ), rang-
ing from 22.3 ± 5.17 vol% to 98.6 ± 2.96 vol% of the original watercontent in bone. Accordingly, signi ﬁcant changes in the mechanical be-
havior of bone were detected.
First, it is noted that the maximum volume in bone that a solvent
could in ﬁltrate into is related to the solvent's polarity, hydrogen bond-
ing ability, and molecular size ( Tables 1 and 2 ). Amongst the selected
solvents, D
2O has a similar molecular size, polarity and hydrogen bond-
ing ability compared with H 2O, thus making it capable of in ﬁltrating into
the spaces originally occupied by water in bone. However, it is interest-ing to note that EG could replace only 85.5 ± 5.15 vol% of the original
water in bone although its polarity and hydrogen bonding ability are
relatively comparable to H
2O. This disparity is most likely due to the
molecular size of EG (~4.0 Å), which is almost as twice large as thoseof H
2Oa n dD 2O( 2 . 4 –2.6 Å). Next, DMF has a comparable polarity, but
signiﬁcantly impaired hydrogen-bond ability and a slightly larger mo-
lecular size (5.5 Å) than that of EG. Accordingly, it exhibits a lesser
soaking capability (around 71.8 ± 3.77 vol%) compared to EG. It is
known that unlike EG and H 2O, which can serve as both hydrogen-
bond donors and acceptors, DMF lacks ability to serve as a hydrogen-bond donor, but only a hydrogen-bond acceptor [30]. Thus, the ability
of DMF to form hydrogen bonds with bone constituents ( i.e.type I col-
lagen and hydroxyapatite crystals) becomes extremely lower than
that of EG and H
2O[17]. However, such signi ﬁcant differences only trig-
ger very limited differences (~13 vol%) in soaking capacity between
DMF and EG. This implies that hydrogen-bond ability may play a
minor role in helping solvents in ﬁltrate into bone matrix. Finally, CCl 4
molecules have no polarity and hydrogen bonding ability, but compara-ble molecular size (5.9 Å) and hydrogen bonding ability to DMF.However, the soaking ability (22.3 ± 5.17%) of CCl
4is much poorer
than that of DME (71.8 ± 3.77 vol%). Thus, it is presumable that polar-ity plays a considerable role in soaking of solvents into bone matrix.
In line with the aforementioned differences in water replacement,
signiﬁcant changes in the mechanical behavior of bone are manifested
in three distinct clusters among the selected solvents ( Table 3 ). Cluster
1 includes the H
2O( c o n t r o l )a n dD 2O soaked specimens, demonstrating
a progressive modulus loss, appreciable plastic ﬂow, and asymptotic vis-
cous response with increasing strain, which are similar to the baseline
controls. Cluster 2 contains the DMF and EG soaked specimens that
have a higher stiffness and fail immediately after the onset of yielding.
Cluster 3 consists of the dehydrated (negative control) and CCl 4soaked
specimens, showing the highest stiffness and no plastic and viscous re-sponses ( i.e.brittle mode).
As previously reported in the literature, the mechanical behavior of
dehydrated bone could be recovered after H
2Or e h y d r a t i o n [1,31] .I ti s
not surprising because water molecules can be fully soaked back intothe ultrastructural. However, it is interesting to note that the mechani-
cal properties are fully recovered by soaking in D
2O, which could soak
into almost all spaces originally occupied by water in bone. AlthoughD
2O exhibits slightly stronger hydrogen-bond ability (~10%) and a little
higher viscosity compared to water ( Table 1 ), no differences in mechan-
ical properties of bone were observed in this study. This suggests that
solvents akin to water may also preserve the mechanical behavior of
bone.
One important ﬁnding of this study is that bone becomes brittle even
if 85.5 ± 5.15 vol% of the matrix spaces that are originally occupied bywater in bone is reﬁ lled with EG. In this case, the EG soaked specimens
lost most of its ductility (or plasticity) and ability in energy dissipationcompared with the controls (H
2O soaked). Since EG has relatively

comparable polarity and hydrogen bonding ability with those of H 2O,
the reason for such a disparity is more likely due to the size difference
between EG (~4.0 Å) and H 2O (2.4 –2.6 Å) molecules [14,15,18] .I n
fact, previous experimental evidence has shown that there are small ul-trastructural spaces in bone that EG molecules cannot in ﬁltrate into
simply due to its molecular size. For example, previous NMR studiesshow that water may reside in the gap at mineral –collagen interfaces
in an order of 3.0 Å [5], which is larger than the estimated molecular
size of water (2.4 –2.6 Å), but smaller than that of EG (~4.0 Å). Thus, it
could be postulated that the ductility of bone may be mainly dependenton the water molecules that reside in very small ultrastructural spaces
(b4.0 Å).
Comparing DMF and EG soaked specimens, no signi ﬁcant differences
in their mechanical properties and a limited change in soaking ability
(about 13% differences) were observed in this study. Since the major
difference exists in the hydrogen bonding ability between the two sol-
vents, this result suggests that hydrogen bonding ability of solvents
may be a minor contributor to bone mechanical properties.
Comparing CCl
4and DMF soaked specimens; signi ﬁcant differences
exist in both mechanical properties (e.g. E0andσu) and soaking capabil-
ities ( Table 3 ). Since polarity is the major difference between the two
solvents, the results suggest that polarity does play a signi ﬁcant role inhelping the solvent soaking into bone matrix. However, its effect on
the mechanical behavior of bone is very limited in this case.
There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone specimens
were collected only from middle aged groups in this study, which maynot be representative of other age groups. Further tests across different
age groups may help elucidate the effect of water on mechanical behav-
ior with aging. Next, the wettability of the mineral and collagen surfaces
were not investigated with respect to the chemical characteristics of the
selected solvents in this study. This information may facilitate under-
standing how the selected solvents in ﬁltrate into the ultrastructural
spaces of bone. Moreover, the selection of solvents that are suitablefor our purpose was limited due to the potential damage that a solvent
could cause to bone during the soaking process. Finally, the progressive
loading protocol employed in this study may not provide the mechani-
cal behavior of bone under the monotonic loading conditions.
Conclusions
By soaking bone in different solvents that have different molecular
size, polarity and hydrogen-bond ability, we investigated the effect of
water on the mechanical properties of bone at ultrastructural levels.
Based on the results of this study, it is postulated that the water
