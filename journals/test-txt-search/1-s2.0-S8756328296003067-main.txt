Acoustic velocity measurements are used to estimate tissue- 
level bone strength after fluoride therapy for osteoporosis. 
However, acoustic measurements provide information about 
elasticity, not strength, and bone elasticity does not necessar- 
ily correlate with bone strength at a tissue level. The current 
study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of fluoride treat- 
ment on tissue-level acoustic velocities, and to determine the 
relationship between acoustic velocity and bone strength 
measured in the femur, femoral neck, and spine. Young adult 
rabbits were treated with either 0 or 100 parts per million of 
fluoride in their drinking water for six months. After treat- 
ment, the bones were harvested for measurement of tissue 
fluoride, bone strength, and acoustic properties. Acoustic ve- 
locities were measured in the femoral midshaft using an 
acoustic microscope with a 50 MHz transducer. Both longi- 
tudinal and transverse velocities were measured. After the 
initial acoustic measurements the bone specimens were 
treated to remove either the organic matrix or mineral, and 
the acoustic measurements were repeated. Fluoride treat- 
ment increased bone fluoride levels 7-8 fold and reduced all 
biomechanical parameters. Most notably the fracture force 
of the femoral neck was reduced by 25% (p < 0.005), and the 
fracture stress of the L-5 vertebra was reduced by 19% (p < 
0.05). Fluoride treatment had no significant effect on any of 
the measured acoustic velocities. The elastic anisotropy of the 
bone was decreased by demineralization (p < 0.0001) and 
increased by removal of the organic matrix (p < 0.0001), but 
unaffected by fluoride treatment. Acoustic measurements 
were not correlated with bone strength in the femoral neck or 
femoral midshaft. There was a positive correlation between 
the longitudinal velocity measured in the femur and the ver- 
tebral fracture stress, but this was the only positive associa- 
tion between acoustic velocities and strength measurements. 
These data cast doubt on the utility of high frequency (>2 
MHz) acoustic measurements for evaluating the efficacy of 
fluoride therapy, especially in the hip. (Bone 19:603-607;

Fluoride treatment can cause anabolic effects on the skeleton, but 
also impairs bone tissue "quality. ''~5 The mechanisms by which 
fuoride affects bone quality are poorly understood, but probably 
include detrimental effects on mineralization 6'12'19 and/or reduc- 
tion of tissue integrity at an microstructural level. 25 It has been 
presumed that tissue-level acoustic measurements of bone elas- 
ticity can provide information about the effects of fluoride treat- 
ment on bone strength. 29 However, acoustic velocity is related to 
material elasticity, not strength, so it remains unclear whether 
acoustics can be used to monitor bone strength. 
The current study was undertaken evaluate the relationships 
between high frequency (>2 MHz) acoustic velocity measure- 
ments and bone strength measured in the spine, femur, and femo- 
ral neck, with or without fluoride treatment. Young adult rabbits 
were used for this investigation because their skeletons undergo 
osteonal remodeling like humans, and they develop increased 
bone mass in response to high intakes of fluoride. 7'2° 
We hypothesized that changes in bone strength caused by 
fluoride treatment would be reflected in acoustic measurements 
at a tissue level. We also hypothesized that fluoride treatment 
would change the elastic anisotropy ratio of bone mineral after 
removal of the organic matrix, since fluoride treatment has been 
shown to change bone mineral crystal size, shape, and packing 
density.13 
Methods 
Study Design 
Twenty-four young 1 adult (3 ~ -year-old) female. Dutch-Belted 
rabbits were used in this study. The rabbits were divided into two 
groups of 12; both groups were fed a standard rabbit chow. The 
experimental group was given drinking water with 100 ppm fluo- 
ride for a period of six months, while the control group received 
distilled water. At the end of the study, the animals were anes- 
thetized and 10 mL of blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. The 
rabbits were then euthanized and tissues removed for analysis. 
All tissue and blood specimens removed from the rabbits were 
identified only by code number. The effects of fluoride treatment 
on tissue fluoride levels, calcium-regulating hormone levels, 
bone formation, mineral crystals, and bone mass are reported 
elsewhere (Turner et al. In preparation). This article describes the 
effects of fluoride treatment on bone tissue acoustical properties 
and their relationship with bone strength.

Tissue Treatment 
Sections were made through the midshaft of the femur using a 
wire saw at low speed under constant irrigation. Two 500 ixm 
sections were cut from the anterior cortex of the bone in both the 
transverse and longitudinal (radial) planes. Acoustic velocity 
measurements were made in the anterior cortex of these speci- 
mens using the techniques described below. The specimens were 
subsequently treated to remove either the mineral or organic 
fractions and the acoustic velocity measurements were repeated. 
Specimens were demineralized by submerging in 10% ethyl- 
ene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma Chemical Co., St. 
Louis, MO) for 72-96 h. Specimens were deproteinized by sub- 
merging in 7% sodium hypochloride (NaOCI) (Sigma) for 72 h. 
This procedure removes all organic material from the bone as 
well as the protein, yet we will use the term "deproteinization" 
for lack of a better word. Demineralization was verified by mi- 
croradiography of several specimens. Deproteinization was veri- 
fied by subsequent demineralization, which left no organic 
residue. 
Acoustic Measurements 
Acoustic velocity measurements were made using a scanning 
acoustic microscope (UH3, Olympus, Japan) by the method de- 
scribed previously. 14 A 50 MHz transducer (V-390, Panametrics, 
Waltham, MA) was used to generate acoustic waves in pulse- 
echo mode. The 50 MHz lens produced an acoustic beam that 
was approximately 60 Ixm in diameter. Accuracy of the acoustic 
technique was verified by measurements on materials with 
known properties (Figure 1). Specimens were submerged in a 
water bath at constant temperature (22°C) and a delay time be- 
tween acoustic waves reflected at the top of the specimen and 
those reflected from the bottom of the specimen was measured 
using a digital oscilloscope (TDS 620, Tektronix, Beaverton, 
OR). Delay times were measured at five different locations in a 
600 Ixm region for each section. Acoustic velocities for longitu- 
dinal and transverse directions (V L and V T, respectively) were 
calculated as twice the specimen thickness divided by the aver- 
age delay time. Acoustic velocity was measured in the center of 
the anterior cortex.

Calculated Elastic Constant (GPa) 
Figure 1. Verification of the elastic constant measurements using the 
acoustic microscope. For comparison with measured values, elastic con- 
stants of metals and plastics were calculated from mechanical properties 
provided by the manufacturers. The elastic constants of cortical bone 
(canine) were measured using a standard technique reported previously. 26 
The slope of the regression line was not significantly different than one 
(p > 0.8, t-test), and the y intercept was not significantly different than 
zero (p > 0.7, t-test). Elastic Anisotropy Ratio 
The anisotropy ratio (AR), which represents the ratio of longi- 
tudinal to transverse elastic coefficients, was defined as the ratio 
of the square of V L to the square of V T. 
Biomechanics 
Bone strength was measured in the femur, L-5 vertebra, and 
femoral neck for each rabbit. Femoral bone strength was mea- 
sured at the midshaft of the femur using a three-point bending 
test. Rabbit femora were removed immediately after termination 
and frozen at -20°C. Before testing, the bones were thawed, and 
bone strength was measured by applying a load midway between 
two supports that were 30 mm apart. The femur was positioned 
so that bending occurred about the medial-lateral axis. Speci- 
mens were tested in saline solution at 37°C. Each specimen was 
submerged in the saline bath for 3 min before testing to allow 
equilibration of temperature. The temperature of the saline bath 
was constantly monitored throughout the test with a digital ther- 
mometer. Temperature in the bath varied by no more than _+ 1 °C. 
Load-displacement curves were recorded at a rate of 1 mm/sec 
using a servo-hydraulic materials testing machine (MTS Corp., 
Minneapolis, MN). Breaking force was calculated as the maxi- 
mum load sustained by the specimen. Bending fracture stress was 
calculated from the failure force using the following equation: 
(Tf = Me~I, (1) 
where gf is bending failure stress, M is the bending moment at 
which failure occurred, c is the distance from the centroid of the 
cross section to the periosteal surface, and I is the moment of 
inertia. 24 The value for moment of inertia used in stress analysis 
was calculated under the assumption that the femoral cross sec- 
tions were elliptically shaped 17 using the following equation: 
I = (~r164)[ab 3 - (a-2t)(b-Zt)3], (2) 
where a is the width of the cross section in the medial-lateral 
direction, b is the width of the bone in the anterior-posterior 
direction, and t is the average cortical thickness. Average cortical 
thickness was calculated from thickness measurements made in 
each of four quadrants of the femoral cross section with a pair of 
digital calipers accurate to 0.01 mm, with a precision of _+ 0.005 
mm. Widths a and b were measured at the location of the femur 
where the top loader contacted the bone. The variable c in equa- 
tion 1 was calculated as half of the width of the bone in the 
anterior-posterior direction. The bending modulus E was calcu- 
lated using the following equation: 
F L 3 
E - (3) d 48' 
where F/d is the slope of the force-displacement curve, and L is 
the length between the loading supports. 24 
Vertebral bone strength was measured after the posterior pro- 
cesses were removed and the ends of the centrum made parallel 
using a diamond wafering saw (Buehler Isomet). Failure load in 
each vertebra was measured in compression using the MTS ma- 
chine. The compressive load was applied through a pivoting 
platen to correct for nonparallel alignment of the faces of the 
vertebral body. 24 Specimens will be tested in saline solution at 
37°C. Breaking force was calculated as the maximum load sus- 
tained by the specimen. Fracture stress was calculated as the 
maximum load divided by the gross cross-sectional area wab, 
where a and b are the widths in the anterior-posterior and medial

lateral directions. Apparent elastic modulus was calculated as the 
slope of the stress-strain curve. 
Femoral neck breaking force was measured by mounting the 
proximal half of the femur vertically in a chuck and applying 
downward force on the femoral head until the neck fails. All tests 
were done at room temperature using the MTS system. 
Tissue Fluoride Measurements 
Fluoride content was measured in the serum, distal half of the left 
femur, and the L-3 vertebra from each rabbit, Bone samples were 
ashed at 600°C for 6 h in a muffle furnace and ground to a fine 
powder before fluoride analysis. Fluoride analysis was conducted 
using the hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS: Sigma Chemical Co., 
St. Louis, MO) microdiffusion method of Taves 2t as modified by 
Dunipace et al. 1 l 
Data Analysis 
All tissue samples were randomized as to their treatment group 
before any measurements were made. After the measurements 
were completed, the code was broken and the data separated into 
control and fluoride-treated groups. Comparisons between fluo- 
ride-treated and control groups were made using a t-test. A paired 
t-test was used for comparisons between acoustic velocities mea- 
sured before and after demineralization or deproteinization. All 
statistical analyses were done using the Statview statistical soft- 
ware (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). 
Results 
The daily fluoride dose for the 100 ppm treatment group was 
about 7 mg/kg. Fluoride treatment greatly increased bone fluo- 
ride levels in both the tibia and lumbar vertebrae of the rabbits. 
However, contrary to our hypothesis, fluoride did not affect the 
acoustic velocities measured in the femoral midshaft (Table 1). 
Demineralization and deproteinization significantly reduced the 
acoustic velocities (p < 0.0001), but fluoride treatment had no 
affect on acoustic velocities after these tissue treatments. The 
elastic anisotropy ratio of the tissue was significantly reduced by 
demineralization (Figure 2) and significantly increased by de- 
proteinization (Figure 3). Fluoride treatment had no effect on 
anisotropy ratio regardless of tissue treatment. 
Fluoride treatment reduced all biomechanical measurements.

The reductions ranged from 5% to 25%. Several of these reduc- 
tions were statistically significant: the fracture force of the femo- 
ral neck was reduced by 25% (p < 0.005, Figure 4), the fracture 
stress of the L-5 vertebra was reduced by 19% (p < 0.05), and the 
bending modulus of the femur was reduced by 21% (t7 < 0.01). 
In general, the acoustic velocity measurements were poorly cor- 
related with the biomechanical measurements (Table 2). Acous- 
tic measurements were not correlated with bone strength in the 
femoral neck or femur, nor were they correlated with bending 
modulus of the femur. There was a positive correlation between 
the longitudinal velocity measured in the femur and the vertebral 
fracture stress, but this was the only positive association between 
acoustic velocities and strength measurements. 
Discussion 
Fluoride treatment decreased several bone strength parameters, 
but tissue-level acoustic velocities were not affected by fluoride 
treatment. Overall, the acoustic velocity measurements were 
poor indicators of changes in bone strength caused by fluoride 
treatment, especially in the hip.

level properties of bone in vitro and in vivo. 1'2 It has been pre- 
sumed that these acoustic techniques provide information about 
bone strength after fluoride therapy for osteoporosis, 29 although 
correlations between acoustic velocities and bone strength have 
never been presented. The current data suggest that acoustic 
measurements are insensitive to bone strength changes resulting 
from a fairly high dose fluoride treatment. Although the acoustic 
measurement technique used in the current study and that used 
by Antich and colleagues are different, they each were verified 
using the same standard suggesting that they measure similar 
tissue-level bone properties. The accuracy of their technique was 
verified by comparison to results from the transmission velocity 
measurement technique developed by Ashman et al. 3 Likewise, 
the acoustic velocity measurements used in the current study 
were highly correlated with transmission velocity measurements 
on bone samples 26 and well correlated with the elastic constants 
of a wide range of materials (Figure 1). 
The acoustic techniques of Antich et al. 1'2 and in the current 
study use relatively high frequency (>2 MHz) ultrasound. At 
these frequencies, the tissue-level properties of bone are mea- 
sured. 4 Commercial ultrasonic densitometers use lower frequen- 
cies (typically with a center frequency of about 500 kHz) and 
measure structural or apparent properties of cancellous bone. 
This distinction is very important for correct interpretation of 
ultrasonic information. Acoustic velocities measured at lower

r = 0.08, p = 0.73 frequencies are strongly influenced by cancellous bone mass, 
since the larger wavelength tends to average the properties of the 
trabeculae and marrow. Bone strength is well predicted by acous- 
tic velocity at lower frequencies, 23 because elasticity and 
strength are well correlated for cancellous bone. 8"16'22'27 Higher 
frequency acoustic waves tend to propagate through individual 
trabeculae and tend not to correlated with trabecular bone 
mass. 29 
It is often assumed that higher frequency acoustic velocities 
reflect bone strength. However, this interpretation is probably 
oversimplified. High frequency acoustic velocity measures a tis- 
sue-level property related to the elastic modulus. Currey has 
shown that, for a variety of mineralized tissues, elastic modulus 
tends to correlate with tissue strength at lower mineral densities, 
but this correlation breaks down at higher mineral densities. 9 Past 
a certain level of mineralization, Currey et al. 1° have provided 
evidence to suggest a strong negative correlation between bone 
mineral content and fracture toughness, while elastic modulus 
tends to increase with increasing mineral content. 9 This suggests 
that the relationship between bone strength and bone elasticity is 
biphasic due to increasing brittleness of bone at very high min- 
eral densities (e.g., osteopetrosis). Therefore, measurements of 
bone elasticity should not predict strength for fully mineralized 
or hypermineralized bone. Reduced strength, as was observed for 
fluoride-treated bone, could be due to hypermineralization of the 
bone caused by fluoride incorporation since mineral density was 
increased in fluoride-treated bones (data not shown). Alterna- 
tively, it is possible that the reduced strength was due to a re- 
duction in interfacial bonding at the level of mineral crystals and 
collagen. 28 Hypermineralization tends to increase acoustic ve- 
locity, while impaired interfacial bonding decreases it. 28 These 
effects tend to cancel one another, thus nulling any effect of 
fluoride on acoustic velocity, but each effect tends to reduce bone 
strength. Others have shown affects of fluoride on bone density 
and acoustic velocity in rabbits. 18 Lees and Hanson found that 
lower doses of fluoride (<20 mg/kg/day) increased bone density 
and acoustic velocity slightly, presumably due to increased min- 
eralization, while higher doses (20-100 mg/kg/day) substantially 
decreased both density and acoustic velocity. They saw no effect 
of fluoride on acoustic velocity at a dose similar to that used in 
the current study (7 mg/kg/day), which is consistent with our 
results. 
The lack of correlation between acoustic velocities and 
strength is not particularly surprising from a materials standpoint, 
since acoustic measurements reflect elasticity, and elasticity 
measurements do not always reflect the strength of materials. In 
metal alloys, it is well known that strength can vary by an order 
of magnitude with minimal change in elastic modulus. For in- 
stance, the tensile strength of steel alloys ranges from 345 MPa 
for low carbon steel to 2000 MPa for cold-rolled steel alloy, yet 
the difference in elastic modulus between these materials is only 
3%. ~ 
It was surprising that acoustic velocities measured at the 
femoral midshaft did not correlate with mechanical measure- 
ments of elastic modulus in the femur. However, an appropriate 
bending test to measure tissue-level properties requires a speci- 
men aspect ratio of 16-2024; the aspect ratio of a rabbit femur is 
about 4. One of the problems of a small aspect ratio is that some 
crushing of the bone occurs under the loaders during a bending 
test, which could be exacerbated by reduced bone strength and 
may lead to an artificially lowered measurement of bending 
modulus. 24 Thus, it is possible that the decrease in bending 
modulus of the femur was due more to testing artifact rather than 
actual reductions in bone elasticity. 
Fluoride treatment had no effect on elastic anisotropy ratio 

Bone Vol. 19, No. 6 C.H. Turner et al. 607 
December 1996:603~507 Acoustic velocity is a poor indicator of bone quality 
after demineralization, suggesting that fluoride did not affect the 
elasticity of the organic matrix of the bone. Likewise, fluoride 
treatment did not affect the anisotropy ratio of the bone mineral 
after deproteinization. This latter result was contrary to our hy- 
pothesis and suggests that fluoride does not affect bone mineral 
elasticity at the ultrastructural level, i.e., in structures smaller 
than 60 p~m. Mineralization defects were not observed in micro- 
radiographs of femora and vertebrae from the current study (un- 
published data), so it is unclear by what mechanism fluoride 
impaired bone strength. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, impaired bone strength in the femur and femoral 
neck caused by fluoride treatment was not reflected by tissue- 
level acoustic measurements. These data cast doubt on the utility 
of high frequency acoustic measurements for evaluating the ef- 
ficacy of fluoride therapy.
