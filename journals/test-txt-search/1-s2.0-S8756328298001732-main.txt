Previous studies have shown evidence of constitutive and
cytokine-inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in cul-tured osteoblast-like cells from various species. Althoughcytokine-induced NO production has been found to inhibitosteoblast growth, the role of constitutive NO production inregulatingosteoblastfunctionislessclearandtheisoformsofnitric oxide synthase (NOS) that are expressed by humanosteoblasts have not been determined. Here, we investigatedNOS expression in cultured human osteoblast-like cells andstudied the effects of constitutive and cytokine-induced NOon osteoblast growth and differentiation. Low levels of NOwere produced constitutively by osteoblast-like cells as re-flected by analysis of medium nitrite concentrations, and
evidence of ecNOS mRNA, protein, and bioactivity wasfound in primary osteoblasts (hOBs), TE85, and MG63 os-teosarcoma cells. None of the osteoblast-like cells expressednNOS, however, and iNOS was produced only by hOB cellsafter stimulation with the cytokines IL-1 b, TNF-a, and
IFN-g. The NOS inhibitor, L-NMMA, did not affect growthor alkaline phosphatase activity in unstimulated osteoblasts.Incubation of hOB cells with cytokines inhibited growth andstimulated alkaline phosphatase activity and these effectswere abrogated by L-NMMA. Cytokines also inhibitedgrowth of TE85 cells and MG63 cells, but these effectsappeared to be NO independent because they were notinfluenced by L-NMMA. Our experiments show that humanosteoblasts constitutively produce NO through the ecNOSpathway, but demonstrate that this does not appear to exertan appreciable effect on osteoblast growth or differentiationunder basal conditions. In contrast, IL-1b, TNF-a, andIFN-gexerted growth-inhibiting and differentiation-induc-
ing effects on osteoblasts that were partly NO dependent,indicating that NO may act predominantly as a modulator ofcytokine-induced effects on osteoblast function. (Bone 24:179–185; 1999) © 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rightsreserved.

Nitricoxide(NO)isanimportantsignalingmoleculeinboneand
is produced by bone cells and organ cultures in response todiverse stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines,

ical strain,14,15and sex hormones.1Although the effects of NO
on osteoclast activity have been studied extensively, less isknown of the physiological role that NO plays in regulatingosteoblast function. Several groups have shown that proinflam-matory cytokines stimulate NO production in osteoblasts byactivating the inducible NOS pathway.
8,13,21Cytokine-induced
NO production has been shown to inhibit osteoblast growth13,26
and to stimulate osteoblast apoptosis.8Evidence of constitutive

isoforms of NOS are responsible for this activity and whetherconstitutive NO production by osteoblasts plays a role in regu-lating normal osteoblast function. In this study we investigateexpression of NOS isoforms in human osteoblast-like cell lines,their regulation by cytokines, and the functional role of NO inregulating osteoblast growth and differentiation.
Materials and Methods
Cell CulturePrimary cultures of human osteoblast-like cells (hOBs) were
prepared from explants of trabecular bone as previously de-scribed.
3,30These cells have been shown to exhibit several
osteoblast characteristics.3Human osteosarcoma cell lines,
MG63,12TE85,19and SaOS-2,31were obtained from the Euro-
pean Tissue Culture Agency. Additional human osteosarcomacell lines studied were U2OS
24(kind gift from Dr. A. Ederveen,
Organon, The Netherlands), cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium(Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and supplemented with 15%
FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine; and Hos 58 (a giftfrom Dr. B. Fohr, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany),cultured in Iscove’s medium (Life Technologies) and supple-mented with 5% FCS and penicillin, streptomycin, and glu-tamine. Cells were cultured in 75 cm
2tissue culture flasks
(Corning, Bibby Sterilin, Staffordshire, UK) in the medium justdescribed. Medium in the cell lines was changed every 3 daysand cells were subcultured upon reaching confluence. Prior toexperimentation, the cells were passaged by trypsin/EDTA andleft to adhere overnight. The medium was then removed andreplaced with fresh medium containing the appropriate stimuli.Unlessstatedotherwise,allexperimentswererunwithfourtosixreplicates and terminated after 48 h.

Assessment of NO Production and NOS Activity
NO production was assessed by the measurement of the stable
NO metabolite, nitrite, in culture medium using the Greissreaction as previously described.
10NOS bioactivity in cell ex-
tracts was measured by monitoring conversion of14C-labeled
arginine to citrulline, using an adaptation of the method de-scribed by Salter et al.
32Briefly, the cells were harvested with
trypsin/EDTA and cytosolic extracts prepared by homogeniza-tion in ice-cold buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,1 mmol/L dithiothreitol [DTT], 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10 mg/mL
soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mg/mL aprotinin [pH 7.2])
followed by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and NOS activity determined byincubating aliquots of the supernatant with
L[14C]-arginine (Am-
ersham, Little Chalfont, UK) for 60 min at 37°C in a potassiumphosphate buffer containing 0.1 mmol/L NADPH, 0.01 mmol/Ltetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mmol/L MgCl
2, and 0.24 mmol/L CaCl2
in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/L EGTA and also 10mmol/L, L-NMMA. Then, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 5.5) wasadded and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1:1H
2O:Dowex AF 500W-X8 resin (Biorad, Hertfordshire, UK).
The mix was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 4 min. Levels of[
14C]-citrullineinthesupernatantwerethendeterminedbyliquid
scintillation counting and the results expressed in relation toprotein content.

Alkaline Phosphatase and Protein Assays
Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured according to the
method of Beresford et al.,
4and corrected for protein content as
determined by the Lowry method.17
RT/PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the method of Chom-
czynski and Sacchi, as previously described,6and 5 mg was
reversetranscribedina20 mLreactionvolume(Superscript,Life
Technologies). The reaction was heat inactivated at 95°C for 5min and the cDNA made up to a final volume of 100 mL using
sterile, double-distilled water. The cDNA was stored at 220°C
until use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which wascarriedoutwithTaqpolymerasesuppliedbyPromega(Madison,WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression ofNOS isoforms was studied by PCR using sequence-specificprimers with amplification for b
2-microglobulin ( b2M) as an
internal control. Sequences of the primer pairs were as follows(all written 5 9-39, with forward primer first and with the ambi-
guitycodesR 5A/G,Y 5C/T,andI 5inosine):iNOS(product
size 334 bp): CTCTAYRTTTGYGGIGATGTGCG and GGA-TATCACTTTCCTCCATCTCCCCA; ecNOS (product size 346bp): AAGCCGCATACGCACCCAGAG and TGGGGTACCG-CTGCTGGGAGG; nNOS (product size 225 bp): AAAGCGAC-CATCCTCTATGCC and CATTTCCATCAAAGCACAGCC;b
2M (product size 321 bp): CCTTGAGGCTATCCAGCGTAC-
TCC and CCATGATGCTGCTTACATGTCTC. The primerswere used at a final concentration of 1 mm each in the PCR
reactions, which were carried out under standard conditions. Thethermal cycling protocol for iNOS, ecNOS, and b
2M comprised
an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 4 min followed by 33cycles of 94°C for 50 sec, 60°C for 60 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec.A similar protocol was used for nNOS, except for the annealingtemperature, which was 50°C instead of 60°C. PCR productswere visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gelsusing a Herolab Easy RH-3 system (Scotlab, Coatbridge, UK).
Immunohistochemistry

Results
Regulation of NO Production and NOS Activity in
Osteoblast-like Cells
Levels of NO production (as reflected by medium nitrite con-
centrations) were low in osteosarcoma cell lines and primaryosteoblast-like (hOB) cell cultures under basal conditions ( Fig-
ure 1). There was a dramatic increase in NO production by hOBcells after cytokine stimulation with IL-1 b(10 U/mL), TNF- a
(25 ng/mL), and IFN-g (100 U/mL), but no increase was ob-
served in any of the osteosarcoma cell lines.
NOS bioactivity was also assessed in cell extracts using an
assay that measures conversion of radiolabeled arginine to thenonpolar metabolite, citrulline. These experiments showedclearly detectable basal levels of activity in all three cell typestested (representative experiment, Figure 2) while also demon-
strating that the levels of arginine to citrulline conversion variedsignificantly between cell type. Values were lowest in hOB cells(mean [range] dpm/mg protein for hOB: 53.8 [2.4–169.5]),intermediate in TE85 cells (118.1 [1.2–223.6]) ( p,0.05 vs.
hOB), and highest in MG63 cells (241.6 [112.8–355.4]) ( p,
0.01 vs. both hOB and TE85). Conversion of arginine to citrul-line was inhibited by both L-NMMA (10 mmol/L) and the Ca
21
chelator EGTA (10 mmol/L) in hOBs and TE85 cells, consistentwith expression of a Ca
21-dependent constitutive NOS isoform.
However, the higher basal levels in MG63 cells were not inhib-
ited by either L-NMMA or EGTA, raising the possibility ofNOS-independent biochemical conversion of arginine to nonpo-lar metabolites other than citrulline.
Expression of NOS Isoforms by Osteoblast-like Cells
Expression of the three different NOS isoforms was studied at
the mRNA and protein level by RT/PCR and immunostaining inhOB, TE85, and MG63 cells, using isoform-specific primers andantibodies. The results of these experiments are summarized inTable 1, with a representative RT/PCR assay from hOB cellsshown in Figure 3 and the results of immunostaining in Figure
4. We found no evidence of nNOS expression in any cell typeunderbasalorcytokine-stimulatedconditions,eitheronthebasisof RT/PCR or immunostaining. In contrast, ecNOS mRNA andprotein was detected in all cell types under basal conditions, buttherewasnochangeinexpressionaftercytokinestimulationwithIL-1b, TNF-a, and IFN- g. Inducible NOS mRNA was weakly
expressed under basal conditions in all three cell types as de-tected by RT/PCR, but iNOS protein was weak or absent fromunstimulated cells, as assessed by immunostaining. After cyto-kine stimulation, iNOS mRNA and protein were dramaticallyincreased in hOB cells, as assessed by RT/PCR and immuno-staining, but not in the other cell types.Effects of NO Donors, NOS Inhibitors, and Cytokines on

TheNOSinhibitorL-NMMAhadnoeffectongrowthoralkaline

In contrast, the NO donors SNAP and SNP hadinhibitory effects on cell growth and alkaline phosphatase activ-ity in all cell types, but only at concentrations that yielded nitritelevels far above those generated by cytokine stimulation ( Figure
6).
Cytokine stimulation in the presence and absence of the NOS
inhibitor L-NMMA resulted in different effects in different celltypes. In hOB cells, cytokine-stimulated NO production wasaccompanied by an inhibition of cell growth and an increase inalkaline phosphatase levels ( Figure 7). Both effects were abro-
gated in a concentration-dependent manner when the experi-ments were performed in the presence of the NOS inhibitorL-NMMA. Cytokine stimulation of TE85 cells and MG63 cellsdid not stimulate NO production (Figure 1), but did inhibit cellgrowth (Table 2). However, these effects were not affected by
L-NMMA, suggesting that the cytokines exerted NO-indepen-

Discussion
Recent work has shown that nitric oxide acts as an important
mediator of cytokine effects on osteoclast activity invitro.
16,18,25,34Several investigators have found that cytokines
stimulate NO production in osteoblasts by activating the iNOSpathway,
13,27and it has been suggested that cytokine-induced
NO inhibits osteoblast growth and activity by NO-dependentpathways. Evidence of basal NOS activity has also been dem-onstrated in human osteoblast-like cell lines,
27,29although the
isoform(s) responsible have not been clearly defined. It has beensuggested that constitutive NO production may exert an auto-crine effect on osteoblast growth and function based on theobservation that the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA inhibited growthand modulated IL-6 production by MG63 cells.
27
Although we did not study IL-6 production here, we found
that L-NMMA had no significant effect on growth or alkalinephosphatase activity in any of the osteoblast-like cells investi-gated. The most likely difference between our study and that justcited
27isthattheearlierexperimentswereconductedinarginine-free medium. This raises the possibility that the effects weremediatedindependentlyofNObyinterferencewithotheraspectsof arginine metabolism. This view is supported by our finding ofhigh levels of arginine conversion to nonpolar metabolites inMG63 cells by pathways that appeared to be NOS independent,asreflectedbythefailureofeitherL-NMMAorEGTAtoinhibitthe process. Although the arginine-citrulline bioassay is com-monly used as an index of NOS activity, the ion-exchangemethod used to separate the reaction products does not differen-tiate citrulline from other nonpolar arginine metabolites such asornithine. In view of this, we speculate that the arginine conver-sion observed in MG63 cells may be due to the production ofornithinebecauseitisknowntobeamajormetaboliteofargininein highly proliferative cells due to shunting into the polyaminepathway.
5Confirmation of this hypothesis will require further
work, however, and was beyond the scope of the present study.
We also found no increase in iNOS mRNA or iNOS protein
under cytokine-stimulated conditions in TE85 cells or MG63cells. These data contrast markedly with the findings of Huk-kanen et al.,
1who reported cytokine-inducible NO production in
MG63 cells from a high basal nitrite level of 15 mmol/L.13
Because the basal nitrite levels in our cultures and in most otherreported work seldom exceeded 2 mmol/L,
7,26,28it is possible
that the results reported by Hukkanen may have been the resultof nitrite release from tissue culture plastics, as has been previ-ously reported.
25It is unclear why osteosarcoma cells should
have lost the ability to produce NO in response to cytokine

stimulation, although this could be due to genetic abnormalities
in cytokine signaling pathways or inability to produce cofactorsnecessary for NOS bioactivity.
We found no evidence supporting a functional role of basal
NOS expression on osteoblast function, at least as reflected bygrowth and alkaline phosphatase activity, but confirmed thatcytokine-induced effects on osteoblast growth were partly medi-ated by NO. This was demonstrated in the primary osteoblastcultures, which showed cytokine-induced activation of the iNOSpathway at the mRNA and protein level. In these cells, cytokine-induced NO exerted an inhibitory effect on cell growth, whichwas reversed by L-NMMA as has been previously report-ed.
8,13,26We also found evidence of a cytokine-induced increase
in alkaline phosphatase activity that was also abrogated byL-NMMA,suggestingthatNOmayhaveadifferentiation-induc-ing effect. Similar effects of NO have been noted in human bonemarrow cells.
33The fact that NO donors had no effect on growth
or alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts at similar nitriteconcentrations achieved by cytokine stimulation, indicates thatcytokinesprovideaco-stimulusthatseemstoberequiredforNOto exert its effects. A similar situation has been reported withregard to the effects of NO on osteoclast function.
34Although
some effects of cytokines on osteoblast growth and activity weremediated by NO, there was also evidence of NO-independenteffects on osteoblast function. For example, the stimulatoryeffect of cytokines on alkaline phosphatase activity in hOB cellswas only partially reversed by L-NMMA. Moreover, cytokine-induced inhibition of cell growth and alkaline phosphatase ac-tivity in MG63 and TE85 cells was not accompanied by anincrease in NO production and was unaffected by the NOSinhibitor, L-NMMA.
In summary, we have shown that basal NOS activity in
human osteoblasts can be accounted for by expression of theecNOS isoform, but we failed to find evidence of an autocrinerole for constitutive NO on osteoblast growth or alkaline phos-phatase activity. The growth-inhibitory effects of cytokines onprimary human osteoblasts were mediated by NO, however, andit has been shown that the cytokine mix of IL-1 b, TNF-a, and
IFN-galso has a differentiation-inducing effect, which is NO
dependent. Finally, our studies have shown evidence for metab-olism of arginine in MG63 cells, which appears to be NOSindependent, suggesting that the arginine-citrulline assay maynot be an accurate reflection of NOS activity in this cell type.
