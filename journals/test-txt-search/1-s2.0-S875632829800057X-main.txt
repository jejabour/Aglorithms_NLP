The temporal expression of bone microsomal casein kinase
II, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase,and the accumulation of a solid calcium–inorganic or-thophosphate mineral phase, have been charted from day2 to day 21 during the repair of calvarial defects in ratsinducedbytheimplantationofdecalcifiedratbonematrix.Unlike the sequence of events that occur when the samedecalcified bone matrix is implanted subcutaneously orintramuscularly, in which cases the first tissue to form inresponse to the implant is cartilage that subsequentlycalcifies and is later resorbed and replaced by bone, therepair of cranial defects is quite different. In the lattercase, the first cells induced are undifferentiated mesenchy-mal cells and early fibroblasts followed by osteoblasticdirect bone formation. Somewhat later a few small islandsof cartilage are formed, widely separated and spatiallydistinct from the newly formed bone matrix. All of thecartilage and most of the implanted decalcified bone ma-trix are later resorbed and replaced by new bone by day21. This in vivo model of the repair of a bone defect bydirect bone formation has provided an excellent system tofollow specific biochemical and physicochemical events.The total accumulation and rate of accumulation of themineral and the two noncollagenous phosphoproteins(bone sialoprotein and osteopontin), as well as the activi-ties of alkaline phosphatase, and for the first time either invivo or in cell culture, the activity of microsomal caseinkinase II, the major enzyme that phosphorylates the bone
phosphoproteins, have been determined as a function ofhealing time in vivo. The overall general pattern of accu-mulation of the phosphoproteins and calcium-phosphatemineral phase and their relationships are similar to thosereported in osteoblast cell cultures also monitored as afunction of time.

Experiments seeking to induce bone formation to accelerate the
rate of bone repair data back to the late 1880s.41,57These early
experiments were the first to demonstrate that a demineralizedbone matrix (DBM) implanted in the skull defects of dogs and inpatientswithosteomyelitisresultedintheformationofnewbone.Somewhat later, Huggins reported heterotopic bone formationinduced by urinary tract mucosa.
26In more recent times, Urist
was the first to conduct a series of very important experiments inwhich he was able to conclusively demonstrate that HCl-treatedDBM induced the formation of bone when implanted intramus-cularly in a number of animal species.
61The following series of
experimentsbyUristandcolleaguesdescribedthecellulareventsin more detail and postulated that the DBM contained a proteinor proteins that induced the proliferation and differentiation of
undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to chondrocytes and osteo-blasts. They termed this hypothetical bone protein a “bonemorphogenetic protein (BMP).”
20,62Similar results were ob-
tained using an acid demineralized dentin matrix.25,30In very
careful studies, Reddi and Huggins50described the process from
the very early stages after implantation of DBM in subcutaneoustissues and demonstrated that the proliferating cells induced bythe implants first differentiated to cartilage. The cartilage cellssubsequently underwent the maturation seen at epiphysealgrowth plates, including the calcification of the cartilage matrix,its resorption, and replacement by bone (endochondral ossifica-tion). The initial formation of bone occurred at about days10–11. Since then there have followed a very large number ofexperiments using this model and a more detailed description ofthe biochemical events, including the temporal appearance andcontent of some of the major matrix proteins.
48–51As noted, the
vast majority of these studies were carried out on DBM implantsplaced in subcutaneous or intramuscular uncalcified tissues.Utilizingfullthicknesscranialdefectsinrats,amodelintroducedby Ray and Holloway,
47Mulliken and Glowacki studied the
temporal, cellular, and morphological events of the repair pro-cess induced by filling the defect with DBM.
42This model was
later used by other investigators in both rats and rabbits.5,39,60
The advantage of this model is that in animals older than ;4
weekswithcranialdefects $8mmindiameter,thedefectsdonot
heal spontaneously. Thus, the cellular and tissue response thatoccurredcouldbeattributedalmostwhollytotheimplantationofthe DBM. Also, the use of cranial defects, as opposed to modelsusing long bone fractures or segmental long bone defects,

avoided the effects of motion at the defect or fracture site and/or
the use of internal fixation devices. Nonetheless, apparently tomore closely mimic the healing of long bone fractures anddefects, there followed a number of experiments in which im-plants of DBM or decalcified bone collagen complexed withBMP were used as models to study the repair of long bonedefects.
4These investigators reported that the repair of the bony
defects occurred by the same sequence of cellular and extracel-lular events, viz., formation of cartilage, maturation of cartilagecells, mineralization of cartilage, and the eventual resorption andreplacement of the cartilage with new bone, as noted for uncal-cified tissue sites.
53,66In contrast to these results, however, we
havefoundinourownstudiesusingcranialdefectsmodelinratsand DBM, studied from day 2 of the repair process, that theinitial cellular response was an immediate proliferation of mes-enchymal cells that rapidly differentiated to osteoblasts and thesynthesis of bone matrix into which a solid Ca-P mineral phasewas deposited. Only small clusters of cartilage were formed atabout days 6–7 that were spatially separated from the newlysynthesized bone. This small amount of cartilage was resorbedand replaced by bone after days 9–10.
64In any event, the repair
of cranial defects provided an excellent in vivo model to studyspecific temporal changes that occur because the repair tissuesynthesized consisted predominantly of bone.
Utilizingthismodel,thecurrentreportpresentsforthefirsttime,
in vivo, the temporal sequence of the expressions of the two majorbone glycosylated phosphoproteins, osteopontin (OPN) and bonesialoprotein (BSP),
2,7–9,44,45which have been postulated to play
significant roles in the formation and resorption of bone and in themechanism of calcification.
3,6,11–19,21–24,27,37,58,63In addition,
wereportforthefirsttimetheactivityofbonemicrosomalcaseinkinase II (CKII) during the formation of bone in the defect, anenzyme that we have previously shown to be the major kinasethat phosphorylates the bone phosphoproteins,
40,54,55and report
the results as a temporal function of bone formation and miner-alization. The assessment of these cellular and biochemicalevents, which have been correlated with the onset of the depo-sitionandtheaccumulationoftheCa-Pmineralphase,wasmadepossible by the development of a highly sensitive quantitativeanalytical method for determination of CKII activity at picomo-lar levels and by the development of a quantitative technique tomeasure OPN and BSP by modification of the enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The overall generalpattern of the accumulation of the phosphoproteins and thecalcium-phosphate mineral phase is similar to those reported inosteoblast cell cultures also monitored as a function of time.
Materials and Methods
Preparation of DBMPowdered DBM with a particle size of 75–250 mm was prepared
from the tibiae and femora of 3–6-month-old male and femaleSprague Dawley rats as previously described.
42,50Prior to im-
plantation, aliquots of the DBM were analyzed for their contentsof Ca
21, OPN, and BSP by methods described below.
Implantation of DBM
Full thickness cranial defects, 8 mm in diameter, were produced
with a dental burr in 5–6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats,rinsed with lactate Ringer’s solution to clear any remainingdebris, and filled with allogenic DBM. The day of implantationis designated as day 0. Implants for biochemical study wereharvested at days 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 using a dissectingmicroscopetoavoidtheinclusionofanyhostbone.Theimplantsfrom three animals were used for each time point. For the
morphologicalstudy,implantswereharvestedwiththehostboneand from six animals.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity of Implant
Implants were cut into 10–20 mg samples on ice, homogenized
in 0.5 mL of cold 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 30 mmol/L NaHCO
3buffer,
pH 7.8, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent (Fluka Bio-chemika),andincubatedfo r1honice.Thereactionmixturewas
then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4°C and thesupernatants assayed for ALP activity after 30 min of incubationat 37°C using p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP, Sigma Chemical,St. Louis, MO) as a substrate. Absorbance measurements at 410nmwereconvertedtomolesofp-NPreleasedperliter,using ε
410
512,500 (mol/L)21cm21, and the time of incubation was used
to provide the rate of substrate hydrolysis in (mol/L)21min21.
One unit of ALP is defined as the enzyme activity that liberatesone micromole of p-NP under the assay conditions. The finalALP activity is expressed as units of activity per milligram oftotal protein in the sample.
Calcium and Phosphorus Contents
Weighted samples of tissue implants were ashed overnight at
700°C in platinum crucibles, dissolved i n 6 N HCl, and trans-
ferred to a volumetric tube. Ca and P contents were measured byatomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,CT) and molybdate methods as previously described.

Isolation of Microsomal and Cytosolic CKII from Implants
Subcellular CKII was isolated as previously described.54After
homogenization of the tissue in 0.5 mL of phosphate buffer, pH7.4,centrifugationat4000gfor5mintoseparatethesupernatantfrom the pellet, the supernatant was further centrifuged fo r1ha t
100,000 g. This latter supernatant contained the cytosolic ki-nases. The pellet from the high speed centrifugation was resus-pended in phosphate buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40,allowed to stand at 4°C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 100,000 g for1 h. The supernatant from this second high speed centrifugationcontained the microsomal kinases.
Assay for CKII
Using dephosphorylated casein. The reaction mixtures, con-
taining a total volume of 0.1–0.2 mL in phosphate buffer(KH
2PO4/Na2HPO4), pH 7.4, I50.2 mol/L, contained 150
mmol/L32P-ATP, (specific activity 20 mCi/mmol, Du Pont
NEN),5mmol/LMgCl2,1mmol/Lethyleneglycol-bis-( b-amino-
ethyether)-N,N,N 9,N9-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 20 mLo ft h e
enzyme preparation, and 20 mg of dephosphorylated casein. The
reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.05–0.1 mL ofH
2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Phosphorylated casein was
isolated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography(HPLC) on a Vydac C-4 column (15 30.38 cm), using a linear
gradient starting from 100% H
2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)
to 60% CH3CN/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over a 60 min
period, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Fractions of 1.0 mL werecollected and monitored continuously by absorbance at 230 nm.Aliquots of 0.05 mL were counted from each fraction for
32P
radioactivity.
Using a synthetic peptide specific for CKII. Reaction mix-
tures used were the same as those used for dephosphorylatedcasein except that a synthetic peptide, RREETEEE
33(LC Lab-622 J. Wang et al. Bone Vol. 22, No. 6
Casein kinase II and phosphoproteins June 1998:621–628
oratories), was used as the substrate instead of casein. The
peptide substrate (20 mg) was phosphorylated and isolated by
reverse-phaseHPLConaRaininDynamaxC-18column(0.45 3
25 cm), using a linear gradient from 100% H2O/0.1% trifluoro-
acetic acid (v/v) in 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min andmonitored at 219 nm continuously. Fractions of 1.0 mL werecollected and aliquots of 0.1 mL were counted for
32P.
Using a synthesized CKII specific peptide derived from OPN.
A second CKII specific synthetic OPN peptide, residues 55–65THYSSEENADV (conserved region of OPN in many species),was also used as a substrate in assaying CKII activity both incytosolic and microsomal enzyme preparations with the samereaction mixtures already described in Using Dephosphorylated
Casein.
Computation of CKII Assays
32P counts of aliquots from HPLC isolated radiolabeled sub-
strates (assays above) were calculated for each substrate in termsof total
32P (dpm) incorporated into 20 mg of substrate. These
data were converted to32P (dpm) per milligram of protein in the
enzymepreparationusedfortheassays,andplottedasafunctionof the time elapsed during the repair.
Protein Content of Implant
Theproteinconcentrationsintheimplantsweredeterminedby
using Bicinchoninic acid (Sigma), a modified Lowry’s meth-od.
38Aliquots of the same respective samples prepared for
OPN, BSP, ALP, and CKII analysis were used for the proteindeterminations.
Evaluation of the Bovine OPN and BSP Antibodies
Polyclonal antibodies to purified native bovine bone OPN and
BSP were induced in rabbits by the injection of purified bovinebone OPN and BSP. The polyclonal antibodies cross-reactedwith the corresponding proteins from other mammalian speciesbut not with chicken OPN or BSP (data not shown). Westernblotsofthecrudetotalextractsofbonecontainingmanyproteinsrevealed the highly specific reaction of the antibodies limited tobovine OPN and BSP.
ELISA for OPN and BSP
The amount of OPN and BSP extracted from the implant by a
sequential homogenization in 0.1 mol/L HCl, followed by asecond extraction of the insoluble pellet obtained by centrifuga-tionat5000ginabufferedsolutionof0.1mol/LEDTA,pH7.4,was found to be essentially the same as that solubilized from theimplant by homogenization and extraction in 0.1 mol/L EDTAbuffered at pH 7.4. The homogenization was carried out forapproximately 10 min per sample: 30 sec of homogenization and30secrestingperiods.Thesampleswereallowedtostandfor ;1
h at room temperature before centrifugation. The ELISA tech-nique was developed based on the method used for the analysisof other connective tissue components.
52Flat-bottom medium
binding electroimmunoassay/radioimmunoassay (EIA/RIA)plates were coated with 25 ng of OPN or BSP antigen per well.The well was filled with a solution containing OPN or BSP at aconcentrationof0.5 mg/mLinasolutionof100 mLofcarbonate/
bicarbonate coating buffer [0.05 mol/L Na
2CO3, 0.05 mol/L
NaHCO3, 0.05% NaN3(w/v), pH 9.6]. After incubating over-
night at 4°C, the buffer solution containing the antigen wasaspirated from the wells. The wells were then blocked with 100mL of 3% defatted bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1–2
h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, and aspirated. Theblocking buffer was removed, and the wells were washed with150mL of a solution of PBST [0.137 mol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L
KC1, 4 mmol/L Na
2HPO47H2O, 1.5 mmol/L KH2PO4, 0.05%
NaN3(w/v), 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), pH 7.2].
The antigen standards (50 mL/well), PBST (50–100 mL/
well), and 50 mL of the unknown sample in PBST were added to
thewells,followedbytheadditionof50 mLofantibodysolution,
(1:5000 in PBS) and the plates were incubated overnight at 4°C.
The plate was warmed to room temperature on the following
day, washed with PBST (150 mL/well), and the second antibody,
an alkaline phosphate conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (wholemolecule)antiserum,diluted1:1000inPBST(100 mL/well),was
added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. ThePBST/antibody solution was removed and the plate washed with150mL/well of TBST (0.05 mol/L Tris HCl, 0.15 mol/L NaCl,
containing 0.05% Tween20, pH 7.6). One hundred mLo fp -
nitrophenylphosphate substrate in the coating buffer (pH 9.6)was added to each well, incubated ( ;90 min), and the absor-
bance at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Mo-lecular Devices, CA).
Standard calibration curves containing 14 different concen-
trations were prepared from purified bovine OPN and BSP in theimplants. The standard curve was analyzed by a “four parameterequation”tocalculatetheOPNandBSPcontentsintheimplants.
Results
As noted in the Introduction , histological and histochemical
examinations of serial sections of the implant tissue at days 3–5clearly revealed differentiation of the initial early, primitive,mesenchymal cells to alkaline phosphatase-staining cells withthehistologicalappearanceofyoungosteoblasts,followedbythesynthesis of an organic matrix that was rapidly calcified.

Assessment of OPN and BSP Content of DBM
The contents of OPN and BSP in DBM prior to implantation
were found to be very low using the ELISA method.
Mineral and Phosphoprotein Deposition
Ca21,P O4, OPN, and BSP were all first detected at day 2
(Figure 2A and B). The total amount of mineral that accumu-
latedintheimplantsincreasedveryrapidly,especiallyinthefirst10 days and slightly less rapidly from day 10 to day 21. Theaccumulation of OPN and BSP also increased with time. ThetotalaccumulationofOPNandBSPwasapproximatelythesameduring days 2–14. However, during the last week (days 14–21),the accumulation of BSP was significantly greater than that ofOPN (Figure 2B).
ALP Activity
ALP activity, first detected at the end of day 2, rapidly increased
to its maximum value at day 7, and abruptly and progressivelydecreased from day 7 to day 21 ( Figure 3).
CKII Activity
Both cytosolic and microsomal CKII activity were first detected
atday2usingallthreesubstrates:asyntheticpeptidespecificforCKII,aspecificpeptidepresentinOPNthatisphosphorylatedinvivo, and dephosphorylated casein. The synthetic peptide spe-cific for CKII was a somewhat better substrate for microsomalCKII during the last week of the experimental period, while theunphosphorylated specific peptide present in OPN was the moreeffective substrate for cytosolic CKII during the last week of therepair (Figure 4). The intensities of the overall enzymatic activ-
ities followed a similar path as the total content of Ca
21, OPN,
and BSP in the tissue (Figure 2). While the general pattern ofCKII activity for both cytosolic CKII (cCKII) and microsomalCKII (mCKII) enzymes were similar, there was a higher level ofactivity for the microsomal enzyme (1.5 3) between days 5 and
14. Also, the cytosolic enzyme showed a more distinct break-point between days 10 and 14 for all of the substrates. Thesesubtle differences are not unexpected since cCKII functionspredominantly in many intracellular biochemical reactions,whereasmCKIIisdirectlyinvolvedinthephosphorylationofthesecretory phosphoproteins.
Rate of Accumulation of Ca
21, BSP, and OPN
In addition to measuring the total content of OPN, BSP, and the
mineral phase in the repair bone tissue as a function of time, wealso calculated the mean rate/day at which these componentswere accumulated during specific time periods, viz., 1–2, 2–5,
5–7, 7–10, 10–14, and 14–21 days. The rate of accumulation ofthe mineral phase after day 2 as a function of time is distinctlydifferent from the patterns of the total content of the mineralphase on the tissue with time, and provided a more effectiveevaluation of the data in terms of the interrelationships betweenCa
21, OPN, and BSP during new bone formation and mineral-
ization.Figure 5 A shows a profile of “mean rates” of Ca21
accretion/day, which are strikingly different than those of the
cumulative total Ca21content shown in Figure 2. The Ca21
content at day 2 was barely detectable. After 2 days there is a
rapid increase in the mean rate of Ca21accumulation/day be-
tween days 2 and 5 (25% of maximum rate), which continuesbetweendays5and7(48%ofmaximumrate),andbetweendays7and10(100%maximumrate).Thisisfollowedbyasignificantdeclineintherateofaccumulationbetweendays10and14(13%of maximum) and between days 14 and 21 (36% of maximumrate) (Figure 5A). Because small and variable amounts of OPN

it was not possible to be certain in any one individual samplewhether additional OPN and BSP had been synthesized by thecells of the repair tissue by day 2 in one individual sample.Therefore,itisnotpossibletostatewhethertheaccumulationsofOPN and BSP at the end of 2 days/0–2 days (Figure 5B)represent the original content of OPN and BSP and the accumu-lation of additional protein synthesized from day 0 to day 2, orwhether it simply represents the phosphoproteins present in theDBMpriortoimplantation.RatesofOPNandBSPaccumulationremained relatively stable to day 7 and slowly increased fromday7today10,atwhichpointBSP,butnotOPN,showedaverymarked increase in the rate of deposition (Figure 5B).
Discussion
We have utilized an in vivo model system in which the repair of
a bony defect in the cranium of rats does not heal spontaneously,but which can be induced to heal by DBM implants. The repairis accomplished predominantly by direct synthesis of new bonewith minimal synthesis of cartilage. This has permitted theinvestigation for the first time of the temporal accumulation andrate of accumulation of the two major bone phosphoproteins(OPN and BSP) and the activities of mCKII that phosphorylatesthem during the repair process. In addition, we have correlatedthese protein expressions with the total accumulation and rate ofaccumulation of the Ca-P mineral phase and the activity ofalkaline phosphatase. These data mark the first report of theactivitiesofbonecCKIIandmCKIIkinasesasafunctionoftimeduring the formation of bone and its calcification either inosteoblast cell culture systems or in vivo. Our previous workwith both the isolated protein kinases from bone cells (osteo-blasts) and the use of a panel of purified protein kinases andquantitative analysis led to the clear identification of CKII as thepredominant kinase involved in the phosphorylation of boneextracellular phosphoproteins.
54–56Further studies of identifica-
tion of the precise sites of phosphorylation of32P-labeled OPN
from cultured osteoblasts confirmed these studies, in which theidentified phosphorylated sites and peptides were predominantlythose with recognition sequences for CKII.
56Therefore, it wassignificant to extend such studies to the in vivo model and
evaluate quantitatively the CKII activity and the accumulationand rate of accumulation of OPN and BSP as a function of bothnew bone formation and the rate of Ca-P accumulation. Theresults of the present work provide evidence that indicates thatone of the prime regulators of the nucleation of a Ca-P solidphaseintheorganicmatrixofbonemaybetheactivityofmCKIIin phosphorylating specific matrix phosphoproteins.
12–15
ThetemporalsequenceoftheexpressionsofOPNand/orBSP
that have been carried out in osteoblast cell culture systems havebeen measured almost exclusively by mRNA synthesis
11,29,46,58
and not by direct measurement of these components in the tissuematrix. Moreover, in osteoblast cell culture systems, only theformation of new bone matrix constituents and the deposition ofa mineral phase occur. Unlike the conditions in vivo, eitherduring the repair of bone or in its normal development andmaturation, there is no resorption, turnover, and remodeling inosteoblastcellculturesystems.Incontrast,however,intherepairof the cranial defects in vivo reported here, both bone formationand resorption occur, and even over the limited 21-day period,theinitial,newlysynthesizedbone,likedevelopingembryonicor

rapidly synthesized postnatal bone, which consists initially of
fine, cancellous woven bone, has been remodeled and replacedfor the most part by compact lamellar bone. Furthermore, notonly is the newly synthesized bone resorbed and remodeled, butthe original nonviable bone matrix implants, and the smallamount of cartilage that is synthesized during the repair, are alsoresorbedandreplacedbynewbone.Inmanyways,therefore,therepair process in this model system, unlike osteoblastic cellculture systems, is very similar to the repair processes of boneobserved in vivo, including fractures in which the repair processinvolves principally new bone synthesis in the early stages withlater resorption and remodeling (well-stabilized fractures), morecomplex fractures with some motion of the fragments, and repairof fragments or regions of fragments of compact and cancellousbone that have been devitalized, and the repair of devitalizedbone (osteonecrosis).
31In the latter case, the spaces between the
dead cancellous trabeculae are invaded by capillaries from theadjacent living bone accompanied by proliferating primitive,
undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. There follows a polarizeddifferentiation of the primitive mesenchymal cells toward thesurface of the dead bone and eventually to their differentiation toosteoblasts and the formation of new bone on the surface of thedead trabeculae. Only later are the dead trabeculae invaded bycapillaries and resorbed by osteoclasts and replaced by newbone.
31
Despite these biological differences between osteoblast cell
culture systems and the in vivo model of bone repair reported inthis article, the overall temporal expression of OPN, BSP, alka-line phosphatase, and the accumulations of the solid Ca-P min-eral phase were in general similar.
11,29,46There is a clear rela-
tionship between the initial formation of the mineral phase andthe synthesis and deposition of the two major phosphoproteinsand the continued relationship between the total mineral accu-mulated and the rate of accumulation of the phosphoproteins.Importantly, the marked increase in the total accumulation ofBSP and the rate of accumulation of this phosphoprotein duringthe last week of the repair was clearly evident in both systems.
29
Since the total mineral content, and in the case of the in vivomodel in which a rate of mineral accumulation was also mea-sured, was not similarly increased, it seems very likely that BSPhas other biological functions in addition to those proposedconcerned with the deposition of the mineral phase.
Although a number of different biological functions have
been postulated for the bone phosphoproteins and for OPN andBSP specifically, such as the modulation of cellular function andbone resorption,
6,21–24,43,44the earliest proposed function of the
bone glycosylated phosphoproteins was their role in the nucle-ation of the apatite crystals. Moreover, all other things beingequal, such as the molecular structure and macromolecular ag-gregation state of the phosphoproteins and other proteins in thetissue, it was also specifically suggested that this importantphysiological function was dependent on the organic phosphategroups of those proteins per se.
12–16,18Indeed, in carefully
controlled in vitro nucleation experiments, complexes of chem-ically and structurally native bone collagen and bone phospho-proteins, located in their native sites in the tissue at the ultra-structural and molecular levels, very markedly influenced therate of nucleation of Ca-P apatite crystals as a function of thetotal phosphoserine and phosphothreonine contents of the com-plex.
12In that study, the latency time, that is, the time that
elapsed before the collagen or collagen-phosphoprotein com-plexes were able to initiate the formation of crystals from thevery same metastable solution of Ca and P, was used as an indexof the efficiency and potency of the nucleation substrate. Impor-tantly, when the phosphate groups were enzymatically removedfrom the phosphoproteins, leaving the dephosphorylated phos-phoproteinscomplexedwiththecollagen,theeffectivenessofthebone collagen complexed with the dephosphorylated bone phos-phoproteins as nucleation substrates markedly diminished andreturned to that of collagen free of phosphoproteins.
12This was
consistent not only with the postulated specific role of thephosphoproteins in the nucleation of the Ca-P solid phase, butalso of the specific role of the organic phosphate groups per se
14
in the nucleation event. Other groups have explored the potentialspecific roles of BSP and OPN individually, either by allowingsolutions of Ca and Pi to pass through denatured collagen gels(gelatin) in which OPN or BSP were dissolved,
3or by assessing
the effect of adding BSP or OPN or the limits of metastability ofCa1Pi solutions,
28or to solutions of Ca-Pi already seeded with
apatitecrystals.59Thedisparateresultsoftheseexperimentsmay
be the result of the different experimental methods used, and theinterpretation of the physical chemical data in relationship to theconditions that exist in vivo.

The accretion or accumulation of additional amounts of the
mineral phase of the bone substance, as it becomes increasinglycalcified with time, is a more complicated process that is notcommonly addressed.
15–17In simple terms, an increase in the
total mass of the mineral phase can occur by three basic routes:(1)theinitialnucleatedcrystalsgrowinsize(crystalgrowth),(2)by an increase in the number of crystals (multiplication), or (3)both.
17The depositions of increasing amounts of the Ca-P
mineral phase in the organic matrix of bone substance as afunction of time after its initial deposition in newly synthesizedbone is very commonly and mistakenly referred to as “crystalgrowth.” In fact, in bone, after an extremely rapid increase in thesize of the extraordinary small nucleated particles to nanosizecrystals, there is very little additional crystal growth with time.
32
The major source of additional mineral mass that is deposited innewly synthesized bone matrix is not the result of crystal growthonce the nanocrystals are formed, but rather is due to theformation of additional crystals (multiplication).
17Nucleation of
these additional crystals can occur by two routes: further heter-ogeneous nucleation of crystals induced by the organic matrixconstituents that occur as physical, chemical, and spatially dis-tinct nucleation events in independent sites even within anindividual collagen fibril, as well as in adjacent or distantfibrils,
35and by secondary nucleation from the crystals formed
by heterogeneous nucleation (secondary nucleation), or fromcrystals formed by secondary nucleation, (tertiary nucleation),etc.
16Indeed, based on qualitative calculations of the possible
number of heterogeneous organic matrix nucleation sites and thenumber of crystals in fully calcified collagen fibrils availablewithin collagen fibrils, it appears clear that the majority of thecrystals formed in the collagen fibrils arise by secondary, ter-tiary, etc., nucleation from crystals already deposited by hetero-geneous nucleation and not by heterogeneous nucleation byorganic matrix constituents.
16
Once this step and the very rapid crystal growth to nanocrys-
tals have occurred to their maximum extent in a specific volumeof the tissue, further accretion of the mineral phase by secondarynucleation, tertiary nucleation, etc., would be independent of thecontent of phosphoprotein in that volume of tissue. The addedcomplications of new bone formation and resorption occurringsimultaneously and with different rates in vivo add furtherdifficulties in attempting to obtain a quantitative relationshipbetween the amount and rate of calcification and the amount andrate of phosphoproteins syntheses and deposition. Indeed, aswould be expected from such considerations, in vivo studies ofbone during aging and maturation have shown an initial rapidincrease in the concentration of serine and threonine phosphateas the accumulation of mineral mass initially increases, but adecrease in their concentrations as maturation and remodelingoccurs, during which synthesis of matrix and the phosphopro-teinsdecreasewhilethemineralcontentofthetissuecontinuestoincrease.
36The same relationship also occurs during the forma-
tion and calcification of newly formed osteones in which the rateof calcification proceeds very rapidly to a mineral content of;50%–65% of the maximum amount of mineral eventually
deposited, and then decreases markedly. The additional, slowmineralaccretiontothefullycalcifiedstateaftermatrixsynthesishas ended or is very markedly reduced results from the fact thatmost of the additional mineral crystals deposited after the first50%–65% of the total mass has been deposited occurs, bysecondary and tertiary, etc., nucleation and not by crystalsdeposited by heterogeneous nucleation.
Nonetheless, the relatively simultaneous onset of mineraliza-
tion, phosphoprotein synthesis, and CKII expression, and theessentially parallel rapid increase of these variables during theearly phases of mineralization, are consistent with the proposedroleofthephosphoproteinsintheinitiationofcalcificationofthe
bone matrix, the specific critical role of the protein-bound phos-phates, and the regulation of protein phosphorylation by boneCKIIthatphosphorylatestheserineandthreonineresiduesofthetwomajorphosphoproteinsofbone(OPNandBSP)andpossiblyother bone matrix proteins as well.
