FemurMice phenotypes are invaluable for understanding bone formation and function, as well as bone disease. The
elastic modulus is an important property of bones that can provide insights into bone quality. The
determination of the elastic modulus of mouse cortical bone is complicated by the small dimensions of thebones. Whole bone bending tests are known to under estimate the elastic modulus compared to
nanoindentation tests. The latter however provides information on extremely localized areas that do not
necessarily correspond to the bulk elastic modulus under compression.
This study presents a novel method for determining the bulk or effective elastic modulus of mouse cortical
bone using the femur. We use Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI), an optical method that enablesthe measurement of displacements on the bone surface, as it is compressed under water. This data iscombined with geometric information obtained from micro-CT to calculate the elastic modulus. Roughlytubular cortical bone segments (2 mm) were cut from the diaphyses of femora of four week old C57BL/6 (B6)
female mice and compressed axially using a mechanical tension –compression device. Displacements in the
loading direction were mapped on the bone surface after loading the specimen. A linear regression of the
displacement vs. axial-position enabled the calculation of the effective strain. Effective stress was calculated
using force ( N) data from the system's load cell and the mean cross-sectional area of the sample as determined
by micro-CT. The effective elastic modulus ( E) was calculated from the stress to strain ratio. The method was
shown to be accurate and precise using a standard material machined to similar dimensions as those of themouse femoral segments.
Diaphyses of mouse femora were shown to have mean elastic moduli of 10.4±0.9 GPa for femora
frozen for eight months, 8.6±1.4 GPa for femora frozen for two weeks and 8.9±1.1 GPa for the fresh
femora. These values are much higher than those measured using three-point bending, and lower than
values reported in the literature based on nanoindentation tests from mice bones of the same age. We
show that this method can be used to accurately and precisely measure the effective elastic modulus ofmouse cortical bone.

Introduction
Mice are invaluable animal models for understanding genetic
mechanisms controlling the processes of bone formation, growth,
physiology and disease, as well as for evaluating novel therapies
[1,2,12,13,16 –20,22,28] . Detailed characterization of the bone pheno-type entails a multilevel description of bone geometry, architecture,material makeup, mechanical behavior and material properties.
Stiffness is an important mechanical property of the bone material
and greatly depends on mineralization and porosity [9,11] . The in-
trinsic stiffness of the bone is quantiﬁ ed by the elastic or Young's
modulus, an inherent property of the bone material [40]. The elastic
modulus is a fundamental determinant of bone's mechanicalbehavior. However, the small size of mice bones complicates the
task of determining their elastic moduli. The importance and
complexity of this issue is manifested by the large number of papers
describing various methods proposed to quantitatively measure
elastic modulus of mice bones [29,32,36 –39,42 –43]. Here we present
a new approach for determining the effective or bulk elastic modulusBone 45 (2009) 84 –90

of mouse cortical bone using the femur. In this method mechanical
testing is preformed in a manner similar in principle to the way a
bone cube obtained from a larger animal would be tested in standard
mechanical compression.
Bone is a graded, hierarchical and anisotropic material. Its elastic
modulus thus varies at different length scales and depending upon
the direction of force applied [9]. Mechanical tests employed to
determine the bulk mechanical properties of bone use relatively large
machined bone samples to measure the elastic modulus directly by
standard compression and tension testing. Mice bones are minute
and are therefore usually tested as whole entities. Two main types of
bending tests, namely three-point bending and four point bending
are used to determine the effective elastic modulus of whole mouse
long bones [7,12,14 –16,22,27,32,43] . By far the most common test is
three-point bending [6,34] . Calculation of the elastic modulus in
bending tests is based on the Euler –Bernoulli beam theory , derived
from the linear theory of elasticity [34]. The main underlying
assumptions of this approach are that the tested sample is isotropic,
has uniform cylindrical geometry and does not undergo shear
stresses during loading. Bone is not isotropic, and its geometry is
irregular. Furthermore, bending tests are associated with some
degree of shear, and local ring-type deformations occur where the
supports and loading prong contact the bone; especially in bones
with a thin cortex [32,39,41] . Signi ﬁcant errors are thus introduced
when measuring the effective elastic modulus using bending tests ofwhole bones. The result is that the modulus is usually markedly
underestimated [36,39,41] . Recently ﬁnite element models (FEMs)
have been used to provide correction factors in order to moreaccurately predict the elastic modulus of mice bones measured by
three-point bending [41]. These models are themselves based on
various approximations and the corrections are still sub-optimal.
Another widely used approach is nanoindentation. However this
method measures the elastic modulus at the nanoscale and istherefore sensitive to the local microstructure [3,8,17,20,26,36,38] .
The measurements involve some plastic deformation in addition toelastic deformation and testing is usually preformed on a dry [3,17,38]
or semi-hydrated samples [26], increasing the stiffness of the bone
material [30]. Measurements of the elastic modulus of mouse cortical
bone using nanoindentation produce values around 26 –31 GPa
[3,8,26,36] . Silva et al. [36] and Chen et al. [8]noted the marked
discrepancy between elastic moduli obtained using bending tests and
nanoindentation tests, with the results of bending tests being
signiﬁcantly lower than those obtained by nanoindentation.
Ultrasonic techniques can also be used to provide data regarding
the mechanical properties of bulk bone material, but are an indirect
measurement of the elastic modulus. Somerville et al. [37] have
estimated the elastic modulus of mature B6 mice tibia as 22.3±2.6GPa for males and 23.2±2.8 GPa for females. Recently Raum et al. [29]
used a method which combines scanning acoustic microscopy andsynchrotron-radiation micro-CT to determine the transverse bulk
elastic modulus of 5.5 month old mice femora (B6 and C3H). Their
results (16.1±1.8 GPa and 22.4±1.9 GPa respectively) are roughly
comparable to those using nanoindentation.
Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is a non-contact
optical metrology method which enables direct measurements of the
displacements on the surface of mineralized tissues during mechan-
ical loading [4,5,21,33,45 –47
]. It is both precise and accurate for
determining the effective elastic modulus of cortical bone cubessubmerged in water [33]. The method is extremely sensitive and
allows detection of displacements at the nanometer level inmillimeter-sized specimens [33,45,46] . In this paper we take advan-
tage of the tubular-shaped, midshaft diaphysis of the mouse femur ina section whose cortical cross-sectional area is nearly uniform along
the axial direction, and show that ESPI can be used for accurately and
precisely determining the effective elastic modulus of this millimeter-
sized, cortical bone segment.Materials and methods
Mid-diaphyseal segments of mice femora, two mm-long, were
incrementally loaded in compression under water. Surface displace-
ments were measured in the direction of compression (axial) using
ESPI. The resulting effective strain in the loading direction was deter-
mined from the displacements, allowing calculation of the effectiveelastic modulus.
Bone sample preparation
Sixteen four week old, C57 BL/6 (B6), female mice, purchased from
Harlan Biotech Israel Ltd. were anesthetized with iso ﬂurane-soaked
gauze in a sealed chamber, and sacri ﬁced by cervical dislocation. The
study was approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee.
The average weight of the mice was 12.03±0.77 g. The left and
right femora were carefully excised and manually cleaned of soft
tissues. A cortical mid-diaphyseal section, starting just distal to the
third trochanter and extending 2 mm distally was cut using a water-
cooled, slow diamond saw (Buehler). Six segments were damaged
during the cutting process and could not be tested. The prepared
segments were scanned by micro-CT (eXplore locus SP, General
Electric, USA) and then wrapped in saline-soaked gauze until
mechanical testing was performed. A total of 23 femoral segments
were arbitrarily separated into three groups, stored in different man-
ners prior to testing. One group consisted of twelve femora frozen at
−20 °C for eight months, a second group consisted of ﬁve femora
frozen at −20 °C for two weeks and a third group of six femora was
tested immediately after harvesting.
The right femora of ﬁve additional four week old, B6, female mice
were harvested for whole-bone three-point bending tests, and were
frozen for two months at −20 °C prior to testing. Whole femora of this
group were scanned by micro-CT, then wrapped in saline-soakedgauze and stored at 4 °C until testing.
Prior to testing, the frozen femora and/or femoral segments were
slowly thawed at room temperature. During the different stages
of sample preparation the bones were kept moist and refrigerated at
4 °C.
Micro-CT structural analysis
Five whole femora and 23 femoral segments were scanned using a
micro-CT device (eXplore locus SP, General Electric, USA). Sixteen
micrometer voxel-size scans were acquired. The X-ray source was set
at 80 kV and 80 μA. 720 projections were acquired over an angular
range of 360°. The image slices were reconstructed using customsoftware (Microview reconstruction software, version 5.2.2). Before
analysis all scans were reoriented in order to uniformly align their scan
axes and anatomical position (i.e. proximal –distal, dorsal –ventral, and
medial –lateral).
Whole femora: Analysis of cortical bone was performed on a
0.5 mm-long transverse section of the diaphysis of the femur(approximately 30 slices), adjacent and distal to the third trochanter
(Fig. 1 A). The cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) was
determined.
Femoral segments: Analysis of cortical bone was performed every
16μm along the segment height ( ∼2 mm). This scan provided the
mean cross-sectional area of the segment along its length.
Mechanical testing setup and loading scheme
A thin coat of white waterproof paint was applied to the diaphyseal
bone segments by spraying in order to increase the intensity of light
reﬂected from the samples [4
 4,45] . A thin layer ( ∼0.5 mm) of dental
composite (Z100, 3 M-ESPE) was placed on the lower (stationary)85 N.L.-T. Chattah et al. / Bone 45 (2009) 84 –90
anvil, and each segment was mounted such that its distal cross-
section rested on the composite with its medial surface facing towards
the CCD camera of the ESPI ( Fig. 1 B). The composite was then cured by
exposure to blue light for 60 s (LITEX 682, Dentamerica CA, USA). Asecond layer of dental composite was placed on the upper anvil, which
was then lowered until the proximal cross-section of the segment was
brought into contact with the uncured composite. The dental
composite, which enveloped the edge of the third trochanter, was
now cured for 60 s. After the composite was cured the upper (mobile)
upper anvil was lowered further, until a pre-load compression of
∼3.5–4.5 N was reached. Finally, the test chamber was ﬁtted with a
high-grade glass window (BK-7 λ/10 grade) and ﬁlled with water
(Fig. 1 B). Water is a major component of mineralized tissues such as
bones, and testing bone samples while submerged in water maintainsthe biomechanical properties of the bone material, known to be
compromised by drying and subsequent microcracking [30,45] .
Each segment was loaded axially and incrementally in compression
using a custom-designed mechanical tension –compression device
[33]. The upper, mobile anvil is a stainless-steel rod attached to an
immersible load cell (AL311BN, I6, Honeywell-Sensotec, OH, USA)
capable of measuring loads up to 120 N in tension or compression. The
rod was moved by a sub-micrometer high-precision DC motor and
controller (PI M-235.5DG, Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH, Germany)
in order to compress the femoral segment against the lower stationary
anvil. The segments were compressed non-destructively within their
elastic region, therefore allowing repeated measurements. Each expe-
riment consisted of four sets of loading cycles in which the samples
were loaded in compression in 50 successive steps of 0.5 micrometer
increments of the upper anvil (25 micrometer movement in total).
A 1.5 second pause was required between successive loading
increments to allow for the ESPI measurements.
Force measurements were collected and stored on a computer
using an A/D converter (Omega DAQP-308 PCMCIA 16-bit Analogue I/O) and further analyzed by custom-written software (National Instru-ments Labview v 7.0 and Matlab v 6.0). At the end of each compression
set the upper anvil automatically returned to its original pre-load
position. By repeating the entire loading sequence four times a robust
and repeatable data set was obtained. Moreover, since each loading
sequence itself was composed of 50 individual steps, each of which can
be evaluated independently, the statistical robustness was further
strengthened.
Upon the completion of four sets, the sample was completely
unloaded, the water was drained, the test chamber was opened and
the upper anvil with the composite attached to it was lifted from the
sample.
ESPI optical measurements
Using a commercially available ESPI device (Q300, Dantec-
Ettemeyer, Ulm, Germany) and custom-written software (Matlab v
6.0), surface displacements were recorded before and after each of the
loading steps on the medial surface of the tested segments in the axial
(Y) direction. In this method, described previously in detail [45], the
rough surface of the bone is illuminated by a coherent laser light source(780 nm wave length) using a dual illumination scheme [33,45,46] .
This optically rough surface is required for application of speckleinterferometry techniques [45]. As coherent laser light scatters from
the optically rough surface of the bone, speckles are formed due to localinterference. Interference with a reference beam is imaged onto a CCD
detector array. The differences between patterns of consecutive
speckle images taken before and after applying the load are used to
detect shifts in the phases of the speckles. These phase shifts
correspond to displacements of the surface relative to a reference
point selected within the region of interest, and their extent can be
determined using a phase shifting algorithm combined with phase
unwrapping. This technique is extremely sensitive, and it is possible tomeasure displacements as small as 25 nm and generate full- ﬁeld
displacement maps ( Fig. 2 ).

Elastic modulus: ESPI optical data analysis
Cumulative Y-direction displacement matrices were created for all
four experimental sets conducted for each segment by summation of
the displacement matrices measured at each of the 50 loading steps.
Every cumulative matrix thus provides the total displacement
(micrometers) for each pixel in the region of interest (over 5000
data points) located on the surface of the sample at the end a full cycle
of 50 loading steps. Each row in the matrix provides the Y-
displacements of pixels located at the same Y-position above the
lower anvil. The measured displacements were nearly uniform at each
Y-position in all experiments and in all samples tested. We could
therefore represent the displacements of each row ( Y-position) by its
mean, resulting in a vector of displacements along the Y-direction of
the sample. The displacement vs. Y-position relationship was plotted,
and a linear regression calculated. The high R2values obtained (in all
experiments the R2values were never less than 0.99) show that the
displacements consistently varied linearly with the Y-position (see
Fig. 2 ). The slope of this linear regression represents the effective
strain of the sample in the Y-direction. It should be noted that while
the magnitude of the measured displacements is determined relativeto a reference point, the gradient measured (Y component of the
strain) is absolute. The delta force between pre-load and the load
reached at the end of the 50-step set was obtained from the
measurements provided by the load cell. This force was divided bythe mean cross-sectional area of the sample as determined by micro-
CT scanning, and the resulting value was considered as the effective
stress. The effective elastic modulus ( E) was thereafter calculated as
the ratio of the effective stress to the effective strain.
Validation
In order to validate the proposed method, three ULTEM tube
samples were prepared. The tubes were made to resemble the bone
segments, namely 2 mm in length, with an outer diameter of 1.26 mm
and inner diameter of 1 mm. ULTEM 1000 (Acetal Polyether Imide) is
an isotropic material (ULTEM 1000
®, General Electric Plastics), with a
known elastic modulus, reported by the manufacturer as ∼3516 Mpa.
The tubes were tested according to the protocol described above.
Elastic modulus: three-point bending
Five whole femora were tested in three-point bending. Biomecha-
nical testing was performed using the same custom-designed mecha-
nical tension –compression device described above, ﬁtted with a
custom-built three-point bending testing device. All bones were testedwhile fully immersed in water. Each femur was placed on two supports
having rounded proﬁ les (0.5 mm diameter) such that the supports
were located equidistant from the ends of the bone, and both contactedthe anterior aspect of the diaphysis. The span between the supports
was 5 mm. Each bone was loaded on its posterior aspect, at the mid-distance between the bottom supports. Loading was conducted at aconstant rate (200 μm/min). Force –displacement data were collected
by custom-written software (Lab view 7.0) at 50 Hz. The resultingload–displacement curves were analyzed to calculate whole-bone
stiffness (slope at the linear portion of the load –displacement curve).
The effective elastic modulus of the cortical bone material was estima-
ted based on beam theory which yields the following relationship:

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were preformed using Graphpad prism 5.0
software (GraphPad, Inc. CA). Statistical signi ﬁcance was set at Pb0.05.
One-way-analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the
effective elastic moduli of the tested femoral segments between the
different groups, followed by a Tukey posthoc test. Elastic moduli of
paired (left and right) femoral segments were compared using a paired
Student's t-test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to examine the
correlation between mouse weight and elastic modulus.

the mean moduli calculated for the different groups were: 10.4±
0.9 GPa for the femora frozen for eight months, 8.6±1.4 GPa for the
femora frozen for two weeks and 8.9±1.1 GPa for the fresh femora. A
one way ANOVA ( Pb0.0086) followed by a Tukey posthoc test showed
that the samples from the group frozen for eight months had asigniﬁcantly higher mean elastic modulus compared to both fresh
segments and those frozen for two weeks ( Pb0.05). The elastic
moduli of paired left and right femoral segments of the same indi-vidual did not differ in the frozen group ( n=3) or in the pooled fresh
and recent frozen group ( N=4) (Paired Student's t-test). No corre-
lation was found between body weight and the calculated elastic
modulus (Spearman's Rank correlation).
Validation
Table 2 shows mean elastic moduli calculated for three ULTEM
tubes determined by the method described above. The table also
provides a comparison with values supplied by the manufacturer
based on three-point bending tests and with those determined by
compression of ULTEM 2×2×2 mm cubes using the ESPI method [33].
The measured moduli of the ULTEM tubes were within 8.5% of thevalue reported by the manufacturer and were close to values
previously reported by Shahar et al. [33]. These results indicate that
the ESPI method is accurate in determining the elastic modulus ofmillimeter-sized, tubular-shaped geometrical specimens.
Precision
The mean elastic moduli of both bone segments and ULTEM tubes
are based on averaging elastic moduli obtained from four separate
incremental loading experiments for each specimen. Tables 1 and 2
show that the standard deviation between the sets is low, rangingbetween 0.64 and 3.53% for the bone segments and 1.14 and 1.99% for
the ULTEM tubes. In the bone segments ( Table 1 ); effective stress and
strain also have low standard deviations ranging between 0.57 and1.56% and 0 and 3.62%, respectively. These results indicate that the ESPI
method is precise.
Three-point bending
The elastic moduli obtained from three-point bending tests were
low compared to results by ESPI ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). The mean
modulus for all bones ( n=5) was 0.88±0.18 GPa.
Discussion
In this study we introduce a novel method for determining the
effective elastic modulus of mice cortical bone using millimeter-sized,
femoral, midshaft diaphyses segments tested in compression. The
elastic modulus is determined using ESPI, an optical metrology
method and is based on averaging the elastic moduli obtained by
four independent experiments for each segment. We show that theESPI method can be used to both accurately and precisely determine
the effective elastic modulus of cortical bone segments by direct
measurement of surface displacements during compression in the
axial direction. The method was tested on four week old mice and the
moduli observed were much greater than those reported in the
literature for mice whole femora of the same age whose elastic moduli
were determined by bending tests ( Fig. 3 ).
Studies have shown that whole-bone bending tests used for
determining of the effective elastic modulus of mouse cortical bone
suffer from major methodological drawbacks as well as a disparity in
testing setups and results [41]. These drawbacks are enhanced when
dealing with long bones of very young mice with relatively thincortices. It is not surprising therefore that only few studies have
reported the elastic modulus for mice of such a young age using
bending tests. Studies such as those conducted by van Lenthe et al.
[41] have shown that the moduli determined for mice femora based
on beam theory greatly underestimate the tissue modulus, especiallyin mice with relatively thin cortices and large midshaft diameter such
as the B6 strain. The researchers used micro- ﬁnite element analysis to
correct for this bias, and obtained values of 12.0±1.3 GPa for 15 weekold B6 mice.
The elastic moduli of mouse cortical bone determined by nano-
indentation are much higher in all age groups than those obtained
fro
m bending tests [3,8,17,20,26,36,38] . Miller et al. [26] reported

Fig. 3. Mean elastic moduli and SD (where provided) of four –ﬁve week old mice femora
and tibia using different testing methods. 3-PB: three-point bending; 4-PB: four point
bending; ESPI: electronic speckle pattern interferometry; NI: nanoindentation. The
unpublished three-point bending study was conducted in the Laboratory of Biome-chanics, School of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Hebrew University,Jerusalem Israel.88 N.L.-T. Chattah et al. / Bone 45 (2009) 84 –90
values ranging between 21 and 28 GPa for 30-day old BALB/cByJ
female mice tibia, while Jiao et al. [17]report values of 20.9±1.6 GPa
for 4 week old C3H female tibia. The bones were hydrated before butnot during the long process of testing. Somerville et al. [37] used
ultrasound to determine the longitudinal bulk elastic modulus of onemonth old B6 mice tibia. They report 15.5 GPa for females and 17.9 GPa
for males.
Fig. 3 shows that nanoindentation, three-point bending and ESPI
all produce different elastic moduli for bones of more or less age-matched mice. However, bending tests and ESPI provide information
on a different length scale compared to nanoindentation.
One means of evaluating which method produces the most accu-
rate results is to take advantage of the correlation between mineral
content and elastic modulus in bones from diverse sources [9–11].W e
determined the ash mass (ash weight/dry weight ⁎100) of 3 of the
femoral segments frozen for eight months and obtained a value of 63
±0.9%. After converting the ash mass (%) to Ca (mg/g) in the bone and
inserting the mean value into the regression equation suggested by
Currey [11], the elastic modulus obtained was 13.8 GPa. The values we
measured using frozen samples are close to this value, indicating thatESPI measurements are accurate. The conversion is based on the
atomic weight of calcium (Ca) in the chemical formulas of carbonate
hydroxylapitite: the proportion of Ca in carbonated hydroxylapatite is
39.8% so 63% ash mass is 63 g/100 g bone. This corresponds to
63⁎0.398−25.1 g/100 g Ca in the bone which in turn corresponds to
251 mg/g Ca in the bone.
In this study we noted that the elastic moduli of bone segments
frozen at −20 °C for a period of eight months were signi ﬁcantly
higher compared to those frozen for a brief two week period or tested
fresh ( Table 1 ). Despite the general agreement that freezing at −20 °C
has little effect on the elastic modulus of bones of different species[23], the effects of freezing on young murine bones has not been
studied. Recently, Nazarian et al. [27]compared the effects of freezing
and formalin ﬁxation on 16 week old B6 mice vertebrae and long
bones. The authors found no difference between the elastic moduli offresh vs. frozen/ ﬁxed samples, using a four point bending method.
However, the study examined bones of older mice which were frozenfor a two week period as compared to eight months in this study.
Although a separate and detailed investigation is warranted, these
results point to possible effects of long-term freezing on the elasticmodulus of bone and underline the high sensitivity of the ESPI
method.
To conclude, The ESPI-based method described here can be used to
accurately and precisely measure the effective elastic modulus of
mouse cortical bone in compression and when submerged in water.
The measurements are thus made under physiologically relevant
conditions. Using this technique we can now mechanically test
millimeter-sized cortical bone segments in a standard compression
test providing an alternative to whole bone bending tests which
underestimate the effective elastic modulus of mice long bones.
Finally, the high resolution mapping of the mouse genome [35]and the
availability of a multitude of genetically altered mouse models haverendered the mouse one of the most studied skeletal systems in bone
research and an invaluable tool in the understanding of major bone
disease such as osteoporosis [24,25,31] . ESPI can therefore be used in
future studies to gain better insights into how speci ﬁc mutations and
treatments may affect the quality of the bone tissue in mice models.
