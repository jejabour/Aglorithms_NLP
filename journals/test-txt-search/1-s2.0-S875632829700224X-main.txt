This study investigated the possible role in vitro of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) as a mediator of the effects ofgrowth hormone (GH) on osteoclastic resorption in an un-fractionedrabbitbonecellmodel.After4daysofrabbitbonecell culture, human GH (hGH) (50 ng/mL) and human IGF-I(hIGF-I) (50 ng/mL) significantly increased the formation ofosteoclast-like cells with a lower level than parathyroid hor-mone (50 ng/mL) or VD3 (10
28mol/L). As well as parathy-
roid hormone and 1-a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, addition of
hGH (1, 10, and 50 ng/mL) and hIGF-I (1, 10, and 50 ng/mL)stimulated the resorption activity of osteoclasts in terms ofthe percentage of dentin slice surface resorbed, number oflacunae per surface unit, and mean area of lacunae ascompared to the control. When neutralizing antiserumagainst hIGF-I (4 mg/mL) was added at the start of culture,
the stimulatory effects of hIGF-I and hGH on osteoclasticresorption activity were totally abolished. These results indi-cate that the effects of GH stimulation on osteoclastic resorp-tion in vitro are mediated via local IGF-I secretion by stro-mal cells such as osteoblasts. As IGF-I receptors haverecently been reported on rabbit osteoclasts, a direct actionof IGF-I on mature osteoclasts could be envisaged. Furtherexperiments will be required to determine the real level ofIGF-I implicated in the stimulation of bone osteoclasticresorption. (Bone 22:25–31; 1998) © 1998 by Elsevier Sci-ence Inc.

IntroductionBone growth is influenced by many biological agents such as
cytokines and hormones. Among these mediators, growth hor-mone (GH), a 191-amino acid polypeptide synthesized by theadenohypophysis, has a variety of physiological effects on var-ioustissues
1,19,32andisconsideredtobeoneofthemajorfactors
controlling longitudinal bone growth.13,14Two hypotheses could
account for the mechanism of GH action on bone growth. It wasfirst demonstrated that the mitogenic effects of GH on osteo-blasts are not due to direct interaction with osteoblasts, but are
mediated through hepatic release of insulin-like growth factor-I(IGF-I).
34It has also been suggested that GH exerts a direct
action on cells through local transmembrane receptors whichinduce the synthesis of IGF-I and IGF-I receptors.
2,17These two
mechanisms now appear to be closely related and highly in-volvedinGHactionsonbonegrowth.TheeffectsofGHonbonecells synthesizing of extracellular matrix are well documented,but not those on resorptive cells such as osteoclasts which areessential to the complex mechanism of bone formation and boneremodeling.
10,36Recent in vivo investigations have revealed that
injections of GH increase not only the biochemical markers ofbone formation but also those of bone resorption.
3,18,39Further-
more, Lewinson et al.24showed that GH depletion led to a major
reduction of resorbing cells in metaphyseal rat bone which wasremedied by GH replacement therapy. On the basis of thesestudies, Nishiyama et al.
28suggested that GH may act on bone
resorption through direct interaction with osteoclasts or an indi-rect mechanism mediated by stromal cells such as osteoblasts.These authors elucidated this point, reporting that GH stimulates
osteoclastic resorption in vitro only in the presence of stromalcells, and proposing that the GH mechanism of action on boneresorption mediated by stromal cells may be through an increasein IGF-I production and/or activity. It is well known that IGF-Iis the key mediator of GH action on osteoblastic cells as well asa major factor directly affecting the cellular activity (prolifera-tion, extracellular matrix synthesis, etc.) of stromal cells via aspecific membrane receptor.
30Yet, its role in bone resorption
remains controversial. In vivo experiments indicate that IGF-Idecreases the number of osteoclasts in rat trabecular bone
33and
has an inhibitory effect on stimulated bone resorption in mousecalvarial bone.
16However, a recent study has shown that IGF-I
increased the biochemical markers of bone resorption (urinaryhydroxyproline-to-creatinine ratio, calcium-to-creatinine ratio,and carboxy terminal telopeptide of collagen type 1) in elderlywomen.
9Moreover, in vitro investigations11,27have provided
evidence for a stimulatory effect of IGF-I on osteoclastic resorp-tion via stromal cell synthesis of chemical factors.
In this context, and regarding previous works,
35,43we first
investigated the effects of GH and IGF-I on the formation andresorption activity of multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phos-phatase (TRAP)-positive cells in a total rabbit bone cell culturemodel. To elucidate the possible role of IGF-I in GH-stimulatedbone resorption, we then studied the effects of neutralizingantisera against IGF-I on the GH-stimulated resorption activityof osteoclasts from an unfractioned rabbit bone cell preparation.

Materials and Methods
ReagentsRecombinant human GH (hGH; Umatrope, 16 IU) was a gener-
ous gift from the Lilly Company (Saint Cloud, France), and1-a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
3(VD3) was kindly provided by Drs.
E. M. Gutknecht and P. Weber. Recombinant human IGF-I(hIGF-I) was supplied byR&D Systems (Abington, UK),
human parathyroid hormone [(hPTH), fragment 1–94 aminoacids] by Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), and rabbitpolyclonal antibodies against human IGF-I (anti-hIGF-I) byPeprotech (Rocky Hill). a-Minimal essential medium (a-MEM),
fetal bovine serum, antibiotic mixture, and phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) were purchased from Gibco (Eragny, France).Twenty-four-welltissuecultureplatesandplasticswereobtainedfrom Nunc (Roskild, Denmark) and glass coverslips from Poly-Labo (Strasbourg, France). TRAP activity and nonspecific a-
naphtyl acetate esterase (NSE) activity were revealed by com-mercially available kits (Sigma No. 387-A and 91-A,respectively). May–Gru ¨nwald Giemsa (MGG) for cytologicalstaining and pronase E were purchased from Sigma.
Cell Culture
Neonatal rabbit bone cells were isolated using a previously
reported method.
35,41,42Briefly, after we killed 13-day-old rab-
bits by cervical dislocation, the long bones were isolated andfreed from soft tissue, minced with scissors, and agitated in 20mLa-MEM medium by vortex for 30 sec. After sedimentation
for 2 min, the cell suspension was harvested (repeated twice).The cells were next washed in a-MEM in a centrifuge (400 rpm
for 3 min) and resuspended in a-MEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and antibiotic mixture (100 U/mL penicillin,100mg/mL streptomycin). Cells were then seeded in 24-well
platesatadensityof10
7cells/well.Theculturesweremaintained
in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2atmosphere at 37°C for 4 days.
Cytological and Cytochemical Characterization ofMultinucleated Cells
Cellular morphology. Total rabbit bone cell preparation estab-
lished on sperm whale dentin slices for 4 days was rinsed with
prewarmed PBS. Dentin slices were then treated with 0.001%pronase E and 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)for 5 min to remove most of the cells while conserving oste-oclasts. The specimens were then fixed at 4°C (glutaraldehydeformaldehyde 3% v/v in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer for 1 h)followed by dehydration with graded alcohol and acetone. Crit-ical-point drying using a CO
2gas/liquid technique was per-
formed after osmium postfixation with 1% osmium tetroxide in0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. Dentin slices werethen gold palladium-coated prior to observation in a scanningelectron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM 6300 apparatus, Tokyo,Japan).
Cytochemistry. Total rabbit bone cell preparation established
on glass coverslips was fixed and stained cytochemically todetectthepresenceofTRAPandNSEactivityafter4days.Cellsstained cytochemically for TRAP and NSE were observed usinga light microscope.
Osteoclast-like Cell Formation and Nucleation
After 4 days, total rabbit bone cell preparation cultured on glass
coverslips in the presence or absence of hGH (50 ng/mL), VD
3(1028mol/L), hIGF-I (50 ng/mL), and hPTH (50 ng/mL) was
rinsed gently with PBS, fixed, and stained cytochemically todetectthepresenceofTRAP,andalsostainedbyMGG.Asmorethan 95% of multinucleated cells (MNC) were TRAP positive,the scoring of MNC and their nuclei was performed with MGG-stained coverslips. The number of nuclei per cell (at least threenuclei) and the total number of MNC per glass coverslip werescored manually with a light microscope (magnification 3200).
Results are expressed as the mean 6standard deviation (SD) of
three experiments.
Pit Resorption Assay
The resorption activity of osteoclasts from total rabbit bone cell
preparation was estimated by pit formation on sperm whaledentin slices which were stored in ethanol/water, washed threetimeswithPBSsolution,andplacedin24-wellplates.Cellswerethen plated at a density of 10
7cells in wells containing dentin
slices. After 4 days of culture in the presence of soluble factors[hGH (1, 10, and 50 ng/mL); hIGF-I (1, 10, and 50 ng/mL);hPTH(50ng/mL);VD
3(1028mol/L);associationofanti-hIGF-I
(4mg/mL) with IGF-I (50 ng/mL); association of anti-hIGF-I (4
mg/mL) with hGH (50 ng/mL)], dentin slices were sonicated for2 min in distilled water and gold palladium-coated for SEMstudies involving a semiautomatic image analyzer (Leica Quan-timeter 500; UK). The resorption activity of cells was analyzedin terms of dentin slice surface area resorbed, number of lacunaeper surface unit, and mean area of lacunae in each conditionpreviously described. All experiments were performed threetimes in triplicate, and results are expressed as the mean 6SD.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated three times.
Results are expressed as the mean 6SD. Comparative study of
means was performed using the ANOVA statistical test. Resultswere considered significantly different when p,0.05.
Results
Cytological and Cytochemical Characterization of
Multinucleated Cells
Multinucleated cells observed after 4 days of culture were NSE
negative and consistently TRAP positive ( Figure 1a). Mononu-
clearTRAP-negativecellssuchasstromalcellsandmononuclearTRAP-positive cells were also observed. Light microscopy stud-ies after MGG staining revealed large cells, with three to 20nuclei usually occupying the central portion of the cell. SEMstudies of adherent cells on sperm whale dentin slices showedlarge polarized cells (30–120 mm) with numerous dorsal mi-
crovilli and peripheral filopodia. As shown in Figure 1b, MNCwereabletoproducelacunaeshowingsomefeaturesofHowshiplacunae. These TRAP-positive multinucleated cells presented achange in morphological characteristics after treatment withcalcitonin (10

Effects of Soluble Factors on Multinucleated Cell Generation
To evaluate the influence of hGH (50 ng/mL), hIGF-I (50
ng/mL), hPTH (50 ng/mL), and VD3(1028mol/L) on the ability
of a total rabbit bone cell culture model to generate TRAP-positive MNC, the number of MNC formed after a 4-day cultureperiod was measured in different conditions. At culture start-up,the number of TRAP-positive MNC deposited in each well was150612 (n 56). After 4 days, the number increased about26 J. Guicheux et al. Bone Vol. 22, No. 1

2.8-foldincontrolconditions,comparedwith3.5-,4.4-,4.7-,and
6.1-fold, respectively for hGH, hIGF-I, VD3, and human para-
thyroid hormone (hPTH) ( Figure 2). The number of nuclei (at
least three) per MNC was also evaluated in each condition. Nosignificant differences were observed between the different sol-uble factors as compared to the control, with a mean number ofnuclei per MNC of about ten. The results of nucleus distributiondid not reveal significant differences in terms of the percentageof MNC per class as compared to the control. These resultsindicate that hGH, hIGF-I, VD
3, and hPTH stimulated the gen-
eration of TRAP-positive MNC without any influence on MNCnucleation.
Effects of GH and IGF-I on Osteoclastic Resorption
To determine the effects of GH and IGF-I on the resorption
activity of the total rabbit bone cell preparation, image analysiswas used to assess resorption of the dentin slice surface, numberof lacunae, and their mean area. The stimulatory effects of hPTHand VD
3were studied initially to provide a positive control forevaluation of the response of the total rabbit bone cell prepara-tion to osteotropic factor. Compared to the control, hPTH (50ng/mL) and VD
3(1028mol/L) significantly stimulated resorp-
tionactivity.Thedentinslicesurfacearearesorbedwasincreasedabout seven- and five-fold, respectively, with hPTH and VD
3.
The increase in the total number of lacunae was less marked(about 3.1- and 2.8-fold, respectively, for hPTH and VD
3), and
the mean area of lacunae was increased only about two-fold inboth conditions ( Table 1). Subsequently, treatment of the total
rabbit bone cell preparation with graded concentrations of hGH(1, 10, and 50 ng/mL) produced a dose-dependent increase in allresorption activity parameters (Figure 3). The maximum stimu-lation level of hGH, obtained with a concentration of 50 ng/mL,increased the dentin slice surface area resorbed six-fold, the totalnumber of lacunae four-fold, and the mean area of lacunae1.5-fold, as compared to the control. Further, hGH appeared tostimulate the formation of lacunae GH stimulates the formationof lacunae with a higher area as compared with the control(22.2 61 lacunae/mm
2for hGH 50 ng/mL vs. 5.24 60.36
lacunae/mm2for the control; p,0.0005 with a mean area of
1142 6115mm2forhGH50ng/mLvs.825 635.34 mm2forthe
control;p,0.05). Similar results were observed in the presence
of IGF-I (50 ng/mL) with 15.64 64.1 lacunae/mm2and area
around 1060.5 650.2 (p ,0.05).
To explore the role of IGF-I in bone resorption, we examined
the effects of graded concentrations of hIGF-I on the resorptionactivity of total rabbit bone cell preparation (Figure 4). hIGF-Iwas found to upmodulate all resorption parameters tested. Com-pared to the control, hIGF-I upmodulated the dentin slice surfacearea resorbed about five-fold (p ,0.0005), increased the total
numberoflacunaeaboutthree-fold( p,0.0005),andaugmented
the mean area of lacunae 1.5-fold ( p,0.05). As previously
described for hGH, significant differences ( p,0.05) in com-
parison with the control were observed in term of number oflacunae per square millimeter and mean area of lacunae in thepresence of hIGF-I (50 ng/mL) (15.64 64.1 lacunae/mm
2and
area around 1060.5 650.2). The effects of neutralizing antisera
to hIGF-I on basal resorption activity and IGF-I or GH-stimu-lated resorption activity were then investigated. At a concentra-

tion of 4 mg/mL, antisera to hIGF-I produced no significant
variation in basal resorption parameters (data not shown). How-
ever, as expected, antisera to hIGF-I caused a suppression of theresorption activity of total rabbit bone cell preparation inducedby hIGF-I. Moreover, under the same conditions, anti-hIGF-Icaused total abolition of GH-induced resorption ( Figure 5).
These results were observed for all resorption parameters testedin the study.
Finally, linking the results of resorbed surface and pits num-
ber per square millimeter to the number of TRAP-positivemultinucleated cells formed in the different conditions, bothparameters per multinucleated cells were significantly higher(p,0.05) in the presence of hGH (50 ng/mL) compared to
control (Table 1). In the presence of hIGF-I (50 ng/mL), bothpreviously described parameters were statistically different fromthose obtained in presence of hGH (p ,0.005 and p,0.001,
respectively). This result was due to the increase in the totalnumberofmultinucleatedcellsformedinthepresenceofsolublefactors,andalsototheincreaseinlacunaemeanareaobservedinall conditions (Table 1).
Discussion
This work confirmed that GH stimulates bone resorption in vitro
byenhancingtheformationandactivationofosteoclastsinanewmodel: a total rabbit bone cell preparation. These results arecompatible with previous in vivo experiments demonstrating aGH-stimulatory effect on bone resorption, particularly in os-teopenic or osteoporotic postmenopausal women,
3,18,24,39who
showed an increase of biochemical markers of resorption. Theyare also in concordance with in vitro experiments in which GHstimulated osteoclastic bone resorption through direct and indi-rect action on preosteoclasts and indirect activation of matureosteoclasts in the presence of stromal cells.
28
Parathyroid hormone and VD3, two differentiation-inducing
factors of osteoclast-like cells which have also been described innumerous studies to affect the activation of mature or preformedosteoclasts,
5,8were tested under the same culture conditions.
Both factors increased the number of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells formed in unfractioned rabbit bone cell culture andhad stimulatory effects on the resorbing activity of matureosteoclasts. These results indicate that PTH and VD
3in these
culture conditions were able to exert their stimulatory effects onthe recruitment and activation of bone-resorbing cells. Thus, thismodel, already described as a means of studying the resorptionactivity of isolated osteoclasts,
37,38appears to be a valid choice
for investigating osteoclast-like cell formation. Indeed, MNCformed in these conditions showed various features of oste-oclasts, such as a TRAP-positive reaction, responsiveness tocalcitonin, and bone-resorbing activity. The last two parameters
are still the most reliable markers for osteoclasts.

In the present work, the study of resorbed surface per
multinucleated cells and the study of number of pits per multinu-cleatedcellsclearlydemonstratethathGH’seffectsonosteoclastactivity arise partly through increasing the formation and/orrecruitment of osteoclasts and partly through stimulating theresorption activity of mature osteoclasts. In this context, and inabsence of GH receptors on mature osteoclasts, the resultsobtained with hGH suggest that the GH action on osteoclasticresorption activity implicates an indirect mechanism probablyinvolving the secretion of cytokines such as IGF-I by stromalbone cells. To elucidate this point, the effects of IGF-I onosteoclast-like cell formation and basal bone-resorption activitywere tested. As previously reported,
11,27IGF-I upmodulated
osteoclast-like cell formation and increased cell resorption activ-ity. The difference between IGF-I and hGH observed in Table 1are probably due to the level of endogen IGF-I secretion inresponsetohGH.Infact,thissecretioniscertainlydifferentfromthe 50 ng/mL added in each well during the experimentalprocedures. Measurement of the IGF-I amount in response tohGH treatment could perhaps allow determination of the preciseoptimal dose of IGF-I in our culture conditions. However, theseresults confirm those reported by Johansson et al.,
15who found
that IGF-I acted as a stimulatory factor for bone turnover inosteoporosis,therebyimprovingthemarkersforboneresorption.GH, as well as PTH and VD
3, is known to influence local
synthesis of IGF-I by bone stromal cells such as osteo-blasts.
4,6,22,25ThesynthesisandsecretionofIGF-Iinresponseto
growthhormonetreatment,coupledwiththestimulatoryeffectofIGF-I on osteoclastic resorption, suggest that IGF-I mediates thestimulatory effects of GH on bone resorption. To clarify thispoint, antisera against IGF-I were tested on the different resorp-
tion parameters explored in this study. As expected, the resultsdemonstrated that anti-IGF-I produces neutralizing effects onIGF-I–stimulated bone resorption. Thus, the effects of neutraliz-ing antisera against IGF-I were then explored in the presence ofhGH. This investigation indicated that IGF-I plays a major rolein GH-stimulated bone resorption, since the GH effects observedon all resorption parameters were totally abolished when anti-IGF-I was added to the culture medium. To our knowledge, thedata presented here are the first to show that GH affects boneresorption via local synthesis and secretion of IGF-I.
AlthoughGHstimulatesboneresorptionviathesynthesisand
secretion of IGF-I by stromal bone cells, previous studies haveshown that IGF-I is unable to stimulate the resorption activity ofrat isolated osteoclasts.

January 1998:25–31 GH stimulates osteoclastic resorption via IGF-1
could play a role in the activation of mature osteoclasts through
the direct stimulation of local transmembrane receptors. More-over, a binding site for IGF-I has been reported on hemopoieticblastcells,
28whichsuggeststhatIGF-Istimulatestherecruitment
and formation of osteoclasts partly by a direct mechanism. Evenif IGF-I could possess a direct mechanism of stimulatory actionon osteoclastic bone resorption, it would be difficult totally toeliminate a possible indirect mechanism. Indeed, with respect tothe literature,
21,26,31,40the different bone-resorptive hormone or
growth factors such as PTH, VD3, or IGF-I induce the release by
stromalcellsofmediatorsimplicatedinthestimulationofmatureosteoclasts. It seems that an unknown stimulating factor couldmediate the effects of osteotropic hormones. Prostaglandin E
2or
colony-stimulating factor-1 have been postulated as possiblemediators. Further, recent investigations have focused on theIGF-binding protein (IGF-BP), a specific regulatory bindingprotein for IGFs postulated to play a key role in bone metabo-lism.
20In the context of a GH-stimulatory effect on the IGF-BP3
serumlevels,29sucharegulatoryproteincouldalsobeimplicated
in GH-stimulated osteoclastic resorption.
In conclusion, this work demonstrates that GH can increase
the resorption activity of mature osteoclasts and also exert aneffect on the recruitment and formation of osteoclast-like cells inan unfractionated rabbit bone cell culture method. It also dem-onstrates that the stimulatory effects of GH on the resorptionactivity of osteoclasts are partly mediated by IGF-I which couldbe synthesized and secreted by stromal bone cells such asosteoblasts. As recent work demonstrates the presence of activeIGF-Ireceptoronrabbitosteoclasts,adirectstimulatoryeffectofIGF-I on osteoclasts can be envisaged. However, an indirectmechanism cannot be totally eliminated. Further experimentswill be required to study (1) the role of GH in the formation andrecruitmentofpreosteoclasts,and(2)thephysiologicalrelevanceof GH implications in the regulation of bone resorption in vivo.
