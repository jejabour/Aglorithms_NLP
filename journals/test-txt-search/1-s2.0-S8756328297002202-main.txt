Impaired bone formation resulting from a decline of osteo-blast activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis ofdiabetic osteopenia. We examined the effects of high glucoseconcentrationalone,independentofinsulindeficiency,onthegrowth of a human osteoblast-like cell line (MG-63). Sus-tained exposure to high glucose for 7 days inhibited cellgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner up to 49.5mmol/L, as compared with cells cultured with a normalglucose concentration (5.5 mmol/L) or a high mannitol con-centration (an iso-osmolar control). Glucose (49.5 mmol/L)attenuated the increment either in DNA content or in[
3H]thymidine incorporation induced by insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I). The IGF-I-induced increase of ornithinedecarboxylase (ODC) activity, which plays an important rolein cell growth, was also attenuated. The half-life of ODCproteinwasnotshortenedbythehighglucoseculture,buttheintracellular content of putrescine (an end product of ODC)was significantly decreased. These changes did not occur inthe high mannitol culture, strongly suggesting a specificeffect of glucose. In summary, our observations suggest thata high glucose concentration significantly impairs the prolif-erative response of osteoblastic cells to IGF-I and that thedefective cell function caused by sustained exposure to highglucose levels might contribute to impaired bone formationin patients with diabetic osteopenia.

IntroductionManystudieshavedemonstratedthatlowbonemineraldensityis
common in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes melli-tus.
14,25,31In a Japanese study, 20.1% of patients with non-
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus also had osteopenia.18There
are several theories on the pathogenesis of diabetic osteopenia,including insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Because insulinhas a stimulatory effect on osteoblasts,
5,8insulin deficiency
causes a reduction of osteoblast cell numbers and cellular dys-function. Hyperglycemia causes: (i) acceleration of urinary cal-cium (Ca) excretion in association with glycosuria
24; and (ii)
impairmentofvitaminDmetabolismthatleadstoCamalabsorp-tion.24However, it is possible that a high glucose concentration
per se might impair the growth or function of osteoblasts.Polyamines are known to play an important role in cell prolifer-ation and differentiation.
28Two rate-limiting enzymes of poly-
amine metabolism are ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and sper-midine/spermine-N
1-acetyltransferase (SAT), which catalyze the
formationofputrescinefromornithineandspermidine/spermine,respectively.
30We examined the effect of sustained exposure to
a high glucose concentration on the growth of a human osteo-sarcoma cell line (MG-63), particularly focusing on the changesof polyamine metabolism. MG-63 cells have an osteoblasticphenotype, including the production of alkaline phosphatase,
11
type I collagen,10and osteocalcin.22These cells also express the
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor29and secrete insu-
lin-like growth factor binding protein.15In the present study, we
found that exposure of MG-63 cells to a high glucose concen-tration inhibited their growth, at least partly via the inhibition ofODC activity.

of various concentrations of glucose (5.5, 33.0, or 49.5 mmol/L)
or in iso-osmolar medium (27.5 or 44.0 mmol/L mannitol plus5.5 mmol/L glucose). The cells were then trypsinized, reseededat 4000/cm
2in 100 mm dishes, and cultured in fresh medium
containing the same concentration of glucose or mannitol. Thenumbers of cells and the DNA content per dish after 1, 2, and 3days of culture were measured. DNA was assayed by the diphe-nylamine method.

Effect of High Glucose on IGF-I-Stimulated Cell Proliferation
To determine whether a high glucose concentration could mod-
ulate the stimulatory effect of IGF-I on the growth and poly-amine metabolism of MG-63 cells, initial culture was done in 35mm dishes with 10% FBS-supplemented a-MEM containing
various concentrations of glucose and/or mannitol for 4 days.Then the cells were further cultured for another 3 days to reachconfluence. On day 7, the medium was replaced with freshmedium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) insteadof FBS. After the cells had been cultured in the medium foranother 30 h, 10 ng/mL IGF-I was added to allow determinationof its effects on cell growth and on polyamine metabolism.
Measurement of [6-
3H]Thymidine Incorporation
After 18 h of culture with 10 ng/mL IGF-I, cells were incubated
for 3 h with 1 mCi of [6-3H]thymidine (3.0 Ci/mmol). The cells
were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline(PBS), scraped off with a cell scraper in 5% trichloroacetic acid(TCA),andcentrifugedat400gfor20minat4°C.Afterasecondwashwith5%TCA,thecellpelletwasheatedat80°Cfor20minin1mLof5%TCA.Aftercentrifugationat400gfor20min,100mL of the supernatant was added to a vial containing 3.0 mL ofscintillation liquid (ACS-II, Amersham International, Bucking-hamshire, UK) and the radioactivity was counted in a Beckmanliquid scintillation counter (LC5801). The rest of the supernatantwas used for measurement of the DNA content by the diphe-nylamine method.
4IGF-I-induced stimulation of [3H]thymidine
incorporation was expressed as an activation ratio, which wasdefined as the percentage of [
3H]thymidine incorporation by
IGF-I-stimulated cells relative to that by unstimulated controlcells.
Determination of ODC Activity
Cells were harvested at 0, 9, 13, 20, 24, 32, and 40 h after the
addition of 10 ng/mL IGF-I. After washing twice with cold PBS,the cells were scraped off and suspended in 250 mLo f5 0
mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 200 mmol/L pyri-
doxalphosphate,0.1mmol/LEDTA,and2.5mmol/Ldithiothre-itol.Thiswasfollowedbydisruptionofthecellsthroughfreezingand thawing three times. After centrifugation for 20 min at30,000g at 4°C, the supernatant was used as an enzyme extractfor the assay of ODC and SAT activities. An aliquot of super-natant (100 mL) was incubated with 40 nmol of
L-[1-14C]orni-
thine (2.96 mCi/mmol) at 37°C for 60 min in a test tube with arubber stopper transfixed by a disposable syringe needle holdinga paper disk incorporating 50 mL of methylbenzethonium hy-
droxide. The reaction was stopped by transfer of the test tube toice and addition of 1 mL of 2 mol/L citric acid. The reactionmixture was incubated again at 37°C for 60 min to allow thepaper disk to absorb all of the
14CO2evolved. The disk was then
placed in 5 mL of toluene scintillation fluid (0.4% Omifluor,Daiichi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) for counting in a Beckmanliquid scintillation counter (LC5801). The protein concentrationof the enzyme extract was measured with a Bio-Rad proteinassay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) using bovineserum albumin as a standard.
Determination of SAT Activity
SAT activity was measured by estimating the incorporation of
radioactivity into monoacetylspermidine from [1-
14C]acetyl-
CoA.50 mLofthecellextractusedfortheassayofODCactivity
was incubated with 10 mmol Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.3 mmol
spermine, and 40 nCi of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (42.6 mCi/mmol) in
a final volume of 100 mL at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was
terminated by chilling, followed by the addition of 20 mLo f1
mol/L NH2OHzHCl. The reaction mixture was then placed in a
boiling water bath for 3 min and aliquots (50 mL) of the reaction
mixture were spotted onto a 2.4 cm disk of Whatman P81 paper.The disks were initially washed with tap water and then washedfive times with 1 mL aliquots of water followed by three washeswith 1 mL aliquots of ethanol on a sintered-glass filter. Follow-ing drying under a heat lamp, the radioactivity on each disk wascounted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter after placingthe disks in vials containing 5 mL of toluene-based scintillationfluid (0.4% Omifluor).
Determination of Intracellular Polyamine Content
After being washed twice with cold PBS, the cells were sus-
pended in 0.4N perchloric acid (1.0 mL per 60 mm dish) anddisrupted with an ultrasonic disrupter (Output 40 W, BransonSonifier Cell Disruptor 200, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT).After the sonicate was centrifuged for 20 min at 400g at 4°C, theresultant supernatant was frozen and stored at 220°C. The
polyamine content of the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC(Shimadzu LC-6A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), using 10 mmol/Lof 1-hexanesulfonic acid sodium salt per 100 mmol/L of sodiumperchloricacidassolventAandsolventAwithmethanol(1:3)assolvent B. The sample was eluted with 96% solvent A/4%solventBfor3minandthenwithaprogrammedsolventgradientusing the linear gradient curve number 0. The gradient changedfrom 4% to 55% of solvent B over 22 min at a flow rate of 0.7mL/min. The DNA content of the pellet was determined by amethod described previously
4and the polyamine content was
standardized relative to the DNA content.
Preparation of an ODC Antibody
The fusion protein encoded by lac Z/odcfusion was used as the
antigen for antibody preparation. The HincII-PvuII fragment of
mouse ODC cDNA13was ligated to an Escherichia coli expres-
sion vector (pUEX-23linearized with SmaI). The fusion protein
produced in this vector was purified by SDS-PAGE and injected
subcutaneously into 8-week-old JW rabbits. Anti-ODC rabbitIgG was purified from antisera by sequential affinity chromatog-raphy using E. coli-galactosidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) con-
jugated, activated CH-Sepharose gel (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Swe-den) and protein G-Sepharose gel (Pharmacia).
Western Blot Analysis of ODC Protein
After13hofincubationwith10ng/mLIGF-I,cellswerewashed
twice with cold PBS and suspended in ODC assay buffer (365mL per 60 mm dish). The cells were then disrupted by freezingand thawing three times. After the homogenate was centrifugedfor 20 min at 30,000g at 4°C, the resultant supernatant was usedeither for the measurement of ODC activity or for western blotanalysis to detect ODC protein. The cell extract (10 mg ofprotein) was separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method18 M. Terada et al. Bone Vol. 22, No. 1

of Lutenberg et al.,20using a composite gel slab consisting of
10%separationgeland3%stackinggel,andthenwastransferred
to a nylon membrane (Immobilon PVD, Pall Ultrafine FiltrationCo., New York, NY) by electroblotting. ODC protein wasdetected with a polyclonal anti-ODC antibody and a commer-ciallyavailablekit(Vectastain,VectorLaboratories,Burlingame,CA) using biotinylated antimouse IgG as the secondary antibodyand avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. The protein content wasdeterminedsemiquantitativelybylaserdensitometrywithadual-wavelength flying-spot scanner CS-9000 (Shimadzu). The mo-lecular size of the protein was measured using the ProteinMolecular Weight Marker (Daiichi Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan)as standard.
Northern Blot Analysis of ODC mRNA
Total RNA was isolated from the cells by the guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroformmethod
8atvarioustimes(0,4,8,
12,and16h)after10ng/mLIGF-Iwasadded.TheRNA(15mg)was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containingformaldehydeandwastransferredtoanylonmembrane(HybondN, Amersham). Blots were prehybridized at 42°C for 16 h in asolution containing 50% formamide, 3 3standard saline citrate
(SSC) (13 SSC: 0.015 mol/L trisodium citrate and 0.15 mol/L
NaCl), 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS, 20 mg/mLtRNA, 20 mg/mL boiled salmon sperm DNA, 1 mmol/L EDTA,and 13Denhardt’s solution (200 mg/mL each of Ficoll, polyvi-
nylpyrrolidone,andBSA).Hybridizationwasperformedfor40hat 42°C in the same prehybridization solution after addition ofcDNA probes for ODC or GAPDH, which were labeled with[a-
32P]dCTP using a multiprimed labeling system (Amersham).
Themembranewaswashedoncein23 SSC/1 3Denhardt’s/1%

Determination of ODC Protein Degradation Rate
After incubation with 10 ng/mL IGF-I for 10 h, cells were
washed with
L-methionine-deficient a-MEM containing the cor-
responding concentration of glucose and/or mannitol. Then thecells were cultured in 35 mm dishes (Falcon, Oxnard, CA) andlabeled fo r3hi n
L-methionine-deficient a-MEM containing 100
mCi of L-[35S]methionine (1144 Ci/mmol). The cells were
washed once more with L-methionine-deficient a-MEM and
were incubated further in fresh medium containing 2 mmol/L
L-methionine instead of L-[35S]methionine. After incubation for
the indicated times, the cells were scraped into RIPA buffer [1%NP-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 0.2 U/mL aprotinin]. The homogenate was then centri-fuged for 30 min at 30,000g and aliquots (5 mL) of the super-
natant were counted for radioactivity in vials containing 3.0 mLof scintillation liquid (ACS-II). The remaining supernatant wasshaken with 20 mL of protein G-Sepharose (50%, v/v) (Pharma-
cia) at 4°C for 1 h. After removal of nonspecific precipitates, themixture was centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min and the supernatantwas incubated with 1 mg of polyclonal anti-ODC immunoglob-
ulin at 4°C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitant was adsorbed byshaking with 10 mL of protein G-Sepharose at 4°C for 1 h, after
which the immune complex was washed five times with RIPAbuffer and then extracted in 20 mL of RIPA buffer by heating at
100°Cfor3min.Thesolutionwascentrifugedat2000gfor2minand the whole supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, asdescribed previously.
20The gel was impregnated with fixation
solution containing 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid, andthen subjected to autoradiography. ODC radioactivity was cal-culated from the density of each band determined by a laserdensitometer and the degradation rate of ODC protein wascalculated from the decrease of the radioactivity in the ODCprotein bands.

Results
Effect of High Glucose on FBS-Stimulated MG-63 Cell GrowthTo determine whether high glucose per se might impair the
growth of osteoblast-like cells, we investigated the effect of 7daysofexposuretoahighglucoseconcentrationonMG-63cells.As shown in Figure 1, glucose inhibited MG-63 cell growth in
a dose-dependent manner up to 49.5 mmol/L, as reflected by adecreaseofcellnumbersandofDNAcontent.Highmannitol,aniso-osmolar control for high glucose, did not affect MG-63 cellgrowth, supporting the specificity of this action of glucose onMG-63 cells. A glucose concentration of 49.5 mmol/L wasselected as the high glucose concentration for furtherexperiments.
Effect of High Glucose on IGF-I-Stimulated MG-63
Cell Growth
High glucose significantly attenuated FBS-stimulated MG-63
cell proliferation by a mechanism that was unknown. Therefore,we next investigated the effect of high glucose on MG-63 cell

Cells were cultured for 4 days to subconfluence. Cells were then
harvested, reseeded, and cultured in fresh medium containing the sameconcentration of glucose or mannitol as before. The number of cells andthe amount of DNA per dish were measured after 1, 2, and 3 days ofculture following reseeding. Data are shown as the mean 6SD of three
determinations. Statistical analysis was done by analysis of variancefollowed by Scheffe ´’sF-test. Similar results were obtained in three

growth, stimulated by IGF-I, which is one of the major growth
factors acting on osteoblasts in vivo, in the absence of FBS.Figure 2 shows that high glucose attenuated the IGF-I-induced
increase of DNA in MG-63 cells. The DNA content was mea-sured 33 h after the addition of 10 ng/mL of IGF-I to cells thathad been cultured for 7 days under normal glucose (n 55), high
glucose (n 55), or high mannitol (n 55) conditions. Exposure
to IGF-I for 33 h increased the DNA content significantly from59.760.9 to 65.7 61.6 mg per 35 mm dish and from 58.4 6
1.8to67.2 61.4mgper35mmdishinnormalglucoseandhigh
mannitol cultures, respectively. However, cells in high glucosecultures failed to respond to IGF-I stimulation, because the DNAcontent of cells incubated with or without IGF-I was 56.4 60.8
and 53.2 62.1 mg per 35 mm dish, respectively. When cell
growth was assessed by [
3H]thymidine incorporation and ex-
pressed as an activation ratio ( Figure 3), the values for normal
glucose, high glucose, and high mannitol cultures were 220 6
14%, 167 69%, and 231 69%, respectively. These dataindicate that high glucose significantly reduced the responsive-ness of MG-63 cells to IGF-I, as assessed by either the DNAcontent or by [
3H]thymidine incorporation (p ,0.05 by Schef-
fe´’sF-test).
Effect of High Glucose on Polyamine Metabolism
To further elucidate the mechanism of the impaired response of
MG-63 cells, we focused on the effect of high glucose onpolyamine metabolism, because polyamines play an importantroleincellproliferationanddifferentiation.

time course of changes in ODC activity after the addition ofIGF-I. In either cells cultured under normal glucose, high glu-cose,orhighmannitolconditions,IGF-IstimulatedODCactivityin a time-dependent manner, with a maximal response at 13 h.The increase of ODC activity in response to IGF-I was signifi-cantly attenuated in high glucose cultures as compared withnormal glucose or high mannitol cultures. Table 1shows ODC
and SAT activities at 13 h after the addition of 10 ng/mL IGF-I.Cells in high glucose cultures had a significantly lower ODCactivity (p ,0.01 by Scheffe ´’sF-test), whereas SAT activity
was not suppressed, but rather was stimulated. At 13 h after theaddition of 10 ng/mL IGF-I, the putrescine content was signifi-cantly lower in high glucose cultures than in normal glucose orhigh mannitol cultures ( p,0.05 by Scheffe ´’sF-test), a finding
in good agreement with the lower ODC activity of high glucose-treated cells.
Mechanism of Decreased ODC Activity in High
Glucose Cultures
We next examined the mechanism by which high glucose de-
creased ODC activity in MG-63 cells. The ODC protein contentwas determined at 13 h after the addition of 10 ng/mL IGF-I.Western blot analysis using rabbit antimouse ODC antibodyrevealedasingle55kDaproteinband,asdescribedpreviously.

Laser densitometry showed that the amount of ODC protein waslower in high glucose cultures than in normal glucose or highmannitol cultures (Figure 5). The extent to which high glucose
suppressed ODC activity showed a good correlation with thechanges of ODC protein, strongly suggesting that the decrease inODC activity was explained by a decrease of ODC molecules.
Next, the ODC mRNA content was determined after the
addition of IGF-I. There was a significant increase in the sta-

tionary level of ODC mRNA at 4 h and this continued in a
time-dependent manner up to 8 h when cells were cultured witha normal glucose concentration (data not shown). Therefore, atreatment period of 8 h was selected to assess the effect of highglucose on ODC gene expression. Northern blot analysis of totalRNA with a mouse ODC cDNA probe revealed a single 2.1kilobase transcript, as described previously.
21As shown in Fig-
ure 6, the level of ODC mRNA was significantly lower in highglucose cultures than in normal glucose or high mannitolcultures.
It was possible that the diminution of ODC protein in high
glucose cultures might have resulted from accelerated degrada-tion of ODC molecules. Therefore, we examined the effect ofhigh glucose on the degradation rate of ODC protein ( Figure 7).
The half-life of ODC protein in normal glucose, high glucose,and high mannitol cultures was estimated to be 60, 77, and 58min, respectively. These data clearly negated the possibility thatIGF-I decreased the ODC protein level in high glucose-treatedcells by enhancing the degradation of ODC molecules.
Discussion
We demonstrated that a high glucose concentration inhibited
MG-63 cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner asreflected by a decrease in cell numbers and the cellular DNAcontent. A high glucose concentration also impaired the respon-siveness of MG-63 cells to IGF-I stimulation of DNA synthesis.Because the effect of a high glucose concentration was notmimicked by a high mannitol concentration (iso-osmolar con-trol), it was not mediated by the effect of osmolarity, indicatinga specific action of glucose. These findings suggest that asustained high glucose concentration alone may inhibitosteoblast proliferation.
We could not detect any inhibitory effect on the growth of
cells cultured with a high glucose concentration for 1–4 days.After culture under high glucose conditions for 7 days, cells thatwere transferred again to a normal glucose concentration re-sumed normal proliferation (data not shown). These findingsseem to rule out the possibility of a cytotoxic effect of highglucose. Because high mannitol, an iso-osmolar control for highglucose, did not affect MG-63 cell growth, the effect of highglucose did not appear to be attributable to hyperosmolarity. Itappears that exposure to a high glucose concentration for a longenoughtimeinducedinhibitionofcellgrowth.Althoughthedataare not shown, the intracellular sorbitol content was also signif-icantly higher in high glucose cultures than in either normalglucose or high mannitol cultures, suggesting that the inhibitoryeffect of high glucose was mediated through accumulation ofsorbitol. In this study, we cultured cells for 7 days becauseculture for a longer period would have required the cells to beharvested and reseeded, complicating the experimental design.Given that (i) the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol is depen-dentontimeandtheglucoseconcentration,(ii)thecultureperiodwas set at 7 days, and (iii) the high mannitol isomolar controlTable 1.

(44.0 mmol/L mannitol plus 5.5 mmol/L glucose) did not affect
MG-63 cells, it appears that 49.5 mmol/L glucose was anappropriate concentration for evaluating the effects of highglucose.Becausesorbitolaccumulationisdependentontimeandthe glucose concentration, a period of 7 days is too short to bedirectlycomparabletotheinvivosituation,eventhoughthecellswere exposed to a concentration of glucose as high as 49.5mmol/L. In addition, previous in vivo studies have reflected notonly the effect of high glucose but also that of insulin deficiencyon osteoblast function. These differences are likely account forthe modest effect of high glucose in vitro relative to the effect invivo.
IGF-I has been shown to act as a mitogen for either normal
osteoprogenitor cells
6or MG-63,26suggesting that it may be
important to investigate impaired reactivity to IGF-I as a mech-anism contributing to the development of osteopenia in diabeticpatients. The IGF-I concentration in human serum is 100–400ng/mL. When the cells were incubated with 100 ng/mL of IGF-I,the DNA content was increased by 30% (data not shown). IGF-IisreportedtobeapotentstimulatoroftheproliferationofMG-63cells and is active at concentrations as low as 0.77 ng/mL.
26We
selected a concentration of 10 ng/mL to investigate the growth-stimulatory effect of IGF-I in the present study. We felt that itwas important to demonstrate differences of IGF-I-inducedgrowth stimulation between normal and high glucose concentra-tion, even though a low concentration of IGF-I was used.
ODC, a rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, is
one of the key enzymes involved in cell proliferation and itssynthesis is regulated by various growth factors.
16SAT is also a
rate-limiting enzyme in the production of putrescine from sper-midine.
27Theactivityofthesetwoenzymesandtheresultantend
product of polyamine metabolism, putrescine, increase whencellsproliferaterapidly.InMG-63cells,highglucosesuppressedODC activity by 51.8% as compared with normal glucose (Fig-ure 4). As a result of the suppression of ODC activity, theputrescine concentration in cells incubated with a high glucoseconcentration was lower than that in cells incubated with normalglucose or high mannitol (Table 1).
These results suggest that the inhibition of ODC activity with
a consequent decrease of putrescine played an important role inthe suppression of cell growth. However, addition of putrescinecould not restore the high glucose-induced suppression of cellgrowth (data not shown), suggesting that another mechanism, inaddition to the decreased putrescine content, was responsible forthe inhibition of cell growth.
High glucose decreased the stationary levels of ODC mRNA
and ODC protein to a similar extent (Figures 5B and 6B). Takentogether with the finding that high glucose did not affect thedegradation rate of ODC protein (Figure 7), this strongly sug-gested that a high glucose concentration suppressed ODC activ-ity by decreasing the stationary level of ODC mRNA. It is yet tobe known about the mechanism by which high glucose sup-pressedODCmRNAlevel.Becausehighglucose-treatedMG-63cells lost growth responsiveness not only to IGF-I but also tovarious other growth factors in FBS, a common and importantpathway for cell proliferation appeared to be impaired by expo-sure to a high glucose concentration. It has been reported that ahigh glucose concentration can activate phosphotyrosine phos-

Figure 7. Effect of glucose on the degradation of ODC protein. After
10 h of incubation with 10 ng/mL IGF-I, cells were labeled with
L-[35S]methionine for 3 h. Then, labeled ODC protein was followed by
the addition of an excess of nonradioactive methionine. The cells werecollected at the times indicated and the cell lysate was immunoprecipi-tated for isolation of ODC. The immunoprecipitant was purified bySDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. The radioactivity of ODCwas calculated from the density of the band, measured by densitometry.The half-life of ODC protein in cells from normal glucose, high glucose,and high mannitol cultures was 60, 77, and 58 min, respectively.

phatase,17resulting in a decrease of the intracellular level of
phosphotyrosine and that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an
important positive signal for cell proliferation.2,12Because ODC
activity is intimately regulated by tyrosine protein phosphoryla-tion,
1adecreaseofODCgeneexpressionduetothehighglucose
concentration might be explained by a decreased phosphoty-rosine content, resulting from activation of phosphotyrosinephosphatase.
